Despite this knowledge, the function of the PD-1 signaling pathway during T cell development has been\nseverely understudied. In the past decade, immunotherapies inhibiting the PD-1:PD-L1 axis have produced\nremarkable improvements in the clinical management of several malignancies, at least in part by restoring T cell\nreceptor (TCR) signaling within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, because TCR\nsignaling is essential for thymocyte development, we postulate PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may have profound effects\non the function and specificity of newly generated T cells. These thymus-specific actions may highlight a key\nunexplored mechanism by which PD-1 blockade elicits anti-tumor immune responses. Leveraging this pathway\nfor pediatric cancer patients may be particularly beneficial considering their high rate of thymic T cell production.\nOur preliminary data illustrate that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) administered in conjunction with anti-PD-1\ntherapy expands the T cell pool and helps overcome treatment-resistance in murine glioblastoma. This may\nsuggest anti-PD-1 therapy acts within the thymus to promote the proliferation and maturation of HSC-derived\nthymocytes. Importantly, pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG) is the prevailing cause of cancer-related death in\nchildren which emphasizes the need for new therapies. Thus it is our priority to investigate this novel pathway\nwith the goal of improving the standard of care for pediatric HGG and other childhood tumors. Our objective is\nto characterize how inhibiting PD-1 signaling modifies thymocyte development in health and HGG. The central\nhypothesis of this proposal is that PD-1 inhibition increases thymic T cell production and promotes the positive\nselection, or survival, of tumor-specific TCRs. Aim 1 will determine the impact of PD-1 blockade on the\nproliferation, selection, and output of developing thymocytes in healthy and glioma-bearing mice. Aim 2 will\nassess the thymic contribution towards the therapeutic response in the context of PD-1 inhibiton and HSC\ntransfer. This work is significant because no prior study has investigated how thymus-specific PD-1 blockade\nimpacts anti-tumor immune responses. The results from this study have the potential to substantially influence\nclinical decision making and treatment regimens for pediatric HGG patients. This project is innovative because\nit will utilize nontransgenic mouse models to more accurately define how PD-1 inhibition affects thymus\nphysiology in health and disease. In summary this proposal will comprehensively characterize how the PD-1\npathway modulates T cell development and will investigate a novel thymic mechanism that may revolutionize\nour understanding of anti-PD-1 therapy in cancer.

DIPG 2-year survival rate is <10% due to its unresectable tumor location and resistance to\nradiation and available therapeutics. This emphasizes the need for better understanding of the underlying\npathogenesis of DIPG to identify new therapeutic vulnerabilities. Histone H3 Lys27Met (K27M) mutations are a\nunifying molecular feature observed ~80% of DIPGs and pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (DMG). The high\nfrequency of K27M and their exclusivity to childhood DIPG and DMG suggests K27M has a unique selective\nadvantage in a distinct spatiotemporal setting for tumorigenesis. Understanding the regional selectively of K27M\nand its phenotypic and molecular effects will further elucidate oncogenic mechanisms and help identify new and\nbetter treatment options. The Baker laboratory developed a genetically engineered mouse model harboring a\nconditional knock-in of K27M into the endogenous H3f3a locus which allows the mutation to be studied in a\nphysiologically and developmentally relevant manner. With this model, we showed K27M cooperates with Pdgfra\nactivation and or p53 loss to drive spontaneous gliomagenesis selectively in brainstem and hindbrain locations.\nK27M causes dramatic loss of the repressive H3K27me3 but only specific changes in gene expression related\nto neurodevelopment. Single-cell RNA-seq of human K27M DIPGs reveals oligodendrocyte precursors (OPC)\nare the main proliferative and stem-like population present in DIPGs. We have also showed that depletion of\nK27M in patient-derived xenografts induces oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation signatures, decreases stemness\nsignatures, and reduces proliferation and tumor growth. In total, these studies indicate a role for K27M in regional\nselectivity of brainstem tumorigenesis along with altered OL differentiation, promoting OPC-like state. However,\nmany questions still remain regarding K27M and DIPG. Why is K27M found almost exclusively in brainstem and\nmidline pediatric glioma? What are the oncogenic effects and mechanisms of K27M alone? I will utilize our K27M\nknock-in mice to dissect the regional effects of H3 K27M on glial development and tumorigenesis in vivo (Aim 1)\nand evaluate the regional K27M-mediated epigenetic and transcriptomic dysregulation in oligodendrocyte\ndevelopment to identify K27M DIPG dependencies (Aim 2). Through completion of these studies, we will gain\ninsights into the molecular mechanisms and spatiotemporal context of K27M that disrupt development and\npromote tumorigenesis which will help to direct therapeutic development to target the molecular programs\ninvolved that are specific to region and cellular state.

project	1F32CA250155-01A1	F32CA250155	10143613	2021	Investigating mechanisms underscoring dichotomous T cell responses between medulloblastoma subgroups	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (30 lines of text):\nMedulloblastomas are one of the most common childhood brain tumors and are comprised of several histological\nand molecularly distinct subtypes based on genetic, clinical, and prognostic factors. Transcriptional profiling has\nsubsequently identified four subgroups which include wingless/integrated (WNT)-activated, sonic hedgehog\n(SHH)-activated, Group 3, and Group 4. Each subtype differs in clinical prognoses, in which WNT tumors have\nbest outcomes, SHH and Group 4 have intermediate prognoses, and Group 3 have the worst outcomes.\nStandard therapeutic treatment of these tumors includes surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However, long-\nterm side-effects often result in negative side-effects for patients, as noted through global reductions in\nphysiological, psychological, and economic welfare of patients. Immunotherapy, given the success in adult\ntumors, is an attractive option as it may impart similar therapeutic success with potentially diminished adverse\nside-effects. Immunotherapies hinge on the relative abundance and cytolytic effector capacity of CD8+ T cells.\nActivation of these cells is dependent on both the immunogenicity of tumors and on priming by competent\nmigratory antigen presenting cells. Once migrated to tumors, relative antitumor success of T cells is dictated by\nthe capacity of cells to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor environment. T cells must also resist T cell\nexhaustion which results from the persistent antigenic environment of tumors. Establishment and propagation of\nthis exhaustive cell fate decision has been demonstrated to be intimately tied to epigenetics. Our preliminary\ndata shows striking differences in PD1hiCD8+ T cells between Group 3 and SHH preclinical tumor models, in\nwhich there is high infiltration of these T cells into Group 3 tumors and low infiltration into SHH tumors.\nConversely, we have observed significantly higher infiltration of PD1hiCD8+ T cells in the tumor-draining lymph\nnodes of SHH tumors expressing N-Myc as compared to Group 3 tumor-draining lymph nodes. Taken together,\nthis dichotomy may underscore differential therapeutic responsiveness, particularly in the presence of checkpoint\nblockade. In this proposal, we aim to investigate both tumor immunogenicity and T cell dysfunction as potential\nmechanisms underscoring these dichotomous T cell responses between medulloblastoma subgroups. In\nparticular, we will examine the inherent immunogenicity of tumors in vivo and determine if established epigenetic\nmechanisms of T cell exhaustion impacts the abundance and therapeutic responsiveness of T cells in Group 3\nand SHH medulloblastomas. The completion of these aims will add to a deeper understanding of the underlying\nbiological differences between the clinical outcomes of medulloblastoma subgroups, as well as inform studies\naimed at enhancing the efficacy of T cell-based therapeutics in medulloblastoma. Furthermore, the techniques\noutlined in this proposal will enhance the professional development of the applicant into becoming an\nindependent researcher capable of running their own research program at an academic institution.

Our preclinical work[1] identified\nBET-bromodomain inhibitors as a potentially promising new class of drugs for children with medulloblastoma\n(MB) and other MYC-driven cancers, providing rationale to evaluate these agents in clinical trials. However,\ntreatment with BET inhibitor (BETi) alone is unlikely to be sufficient for a cure, with most tumors evolving to\nacquire resistance to single-agent targeted therapies. An attractive strategy to overcoming therapy resistance\nis to identify and exploit new vulnerabilities that exist in drug-tolerant cells. Metabolic pathways are of particular\ninterest in this context as they often rely on few essential enzymes, are frequently “rewired” in cancer cells vs.\nnormal cells, support and drive adaptive resistance to drug, provide essential survival capabilities, and can be\neasily targeted with pharmacologic inhibitors[3]. Our previous work applied an integrative genomics approach to\nidentify genes and pathways mediating BETi response in MB[2]. These studies revealed that MYC-driven MB\ncells with acquired resistance to BETi reinstate transcription of essential genes suppressed by drug and exhibit\nchanges in cell-state and new vulnerabilities not present in drug-sensitive cells. We now have a growing body\nof evidence showing that BET inhibition downregulates the expression of key lipid metabolism genes and\nmetabolism-related signaling pathways, and that MB cells with adaptive resistance to BETi differentially\nexpress and exhibit preferential dependency on specific lipid metabolic genes and transcriptional regulators.\nThese findings led me to hypothesize that metabolic reprogramming creates novel vulnerabilities in BETi drug-\ntolerant MB cells that can be targeted to overcome resistance. The studies described herein will characterize\nthe altered lipid metabolism of BETi-resistant MB cells, assess the impact of BETi-driven metabolic rewiring on\ncell signaling and the resistance phenotype, and investigate the possibility of exploiting lipid metabolic\ndependencies as a novel approach to overcome resistance to BETi-targeted therapy.

project	1K08CA259610-01	K08CA259610	10192359	2021	Developing novel CAR T cell designs using combinatorial antigen detection	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCandidate: The applicant, Greg Allen, MD/PhD, is a medical oncologist at UCSF with a long-term goal to lead\nan independent laboratory-based translational research program focused on cellular therapies. The K08\napplication is key for his career development, providing him with (1) mentorship from a diverse team of scientists\nand physician-scientists, (2) formal didactics to expand his knowledge in clinical trial design and tumor\nimmunology, (3) extensive hands-on training in the translation of newly developed cellular therapies to early\nphase clinical trials and (4) data collection for an R01 application.\nResearch: CAR T cells are a game-changing treatment for B cell malignancies — genetically reprogramming a\npatient's cytotoxic T cells allows them to recognize and clear tumor cells. Unfortunately for solid cancers the\ncurrent generation of CAR T cells have been ineffective – no simple single antigen targeted CAR is able to\nprecisely recognize and safely clear solid tumor cells. There is a clear unmet need for the design and\nimplementation of the next-generation of engineered cell therapies to overcome these challenges. The core\nhypothesis of this proposal is that combinatorial antigen recognition—the detection of tumor cells and tumor\nmicroenvironments using information from multiple antigens (with AND/OR/NOT gates) can provide a powerful\nsolution to the problem of precise recognition and allow the construction of more effective therapies.\nIn this project the first aim will investigate the use of AND gates to safely target pancreatic adenocarcinoma by\nrecognizing and overcoming the suppressive tumor-microenvironment seen in this disease. The second aim\nwill apply newly developed receptors that provide NOT gate functionality to avoid CNS toxicity seen with CAR T\ncells designed to target neuroblastoma.\nMentorship and Training: Dr. Allen's training will be accomplished through formal coursework and under direct\nmentorship of world leaders including Wendell Lim, PhD, chair of the Department of Molecular and Cellular\nPharmacology at UCSF who has extensive expertise in modular signaling platforms, synthetic biology and\ncellular therapy. Professor Lim has over his 20 years at UCSF mentored ~50 postdoctoral fellow as well as 4\nclinical fellows. Dr. Allen will be co-mentored by Dr. Larry Fong, MD, an expert in translational immunology and\nimmunotherapy who leads the Cancer Immunotherapy Program at UCSF and has extensive experience in\nhelping translational immunology researchers achieve independence.\nEnvironment: The candidate's training and research will be performed at the University of California, San\nFrancisco, which provides an exceptional research environment with state-of-art facilities and world-renowned\nfaculty. UCSF is dedicated to developing next-generation cell therapies and Dr. Allen will be part of the UCSF\nCell Design Institute (focused on cell engineering), the UCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology and the UCSF\nHelen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center.

project	1K08CA263179-01	K08CA263179	10282756	2021	Defining a therapeutic platform for DIPG with mRNA CAR T cells and microglia inhibition	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nDr. Jessica Foster's career goal is to become a translational physician-scientist focused on immunotherapy for\npediatric brain tumors. This proposal describes a five-year plan to facilitate her transition to independence\nthrough the acquisition of critical technical skills and scientific training in brain tumor modeling and evaluation\nof the tumor microenvironment with single cell RNA sequencing, integrated with comprehensive mentoring\nfrom a diverse team of faculty members. She will conduct the proposed studies under the proven mentorship of\nDr. John Maris, an international leader in translational neuroblastoma research and immunogenomics.\nAdditionally, her dedicated Advisory Committee is comprised of highly regarded physician-scientists with\ndiverse expertise in immunotherapy and pediatric brain tumors. Finally, the collaborative research environment\nwith unparalleled resources at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia\nprovides an ideal setting to conduct these translational studies.\nDiffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a devastating pediatric brain tumor that remains incurable despite\ndecades of clinical trials, with a median survival of 11 months. This proposal seeks to use chimeric antigen\nreceptor (CAR) T cell therapy, a form of immunotherapy, to target DIPG. Recently GD2 was identified as an\nimmunotherapeutic target for DIPG, and lentiviral GD2-directed CAR T cells were able to successfully treat\nmurine models of DIPG. However, a significant number of mice treated with CAR T cells died due to\ninflammation and herniation, prompting concerns for potential toxicity from this therapy, in particular in the\npons. This proposal is building upon the applicant's experience utilizing mRNA for the creation of CAR T cells\nthat are transient and can be titrated to effect to avoid toxicity, here using repeated local delivery of GD2-\ndirected mRNA CAR T cells to effectively treat DIPG while still maintaining safety. Aim 1 will determine the\neffect of GD2-directed mRNA CAR T cells on tumor, microenvironment and normal tissue using both\nimmunocompetent and xenograft models of DIPG. Aim 2 will use single cell RNA sequencing to investigate the\nrole of microglia in DIPG development and test mRNA CAR T cells in combination with inhibition of microglia.\nDr. Foster's ultimate goal is to create a clinical trial for patients with DIPG using mRNA CAR T cells directed\nagainst GD2, as well as generating a new treatment platform for all pediatric brain tumors. These efforts will\nprovide an outstanding foundation for her career as a physician-scientist and the development of an\nindependent translational research program.

project	1K99CA263021-01	K99CA263021	10283079	2021	Reviving cancer immune surveillance with CD4 T cell help	Grant	Abstract\nThe immune system is capable of eliminating advanced malignant tumors, yet cancer immunotherapy success\nhas been limited to a subset of cancer types. Conventional CD4, or `helper', T cells play an integral role in\norchestrating immune responses, and can potentiate the function of antitumor immunity: both via activation and\npotentiation of antigen presenting cell function and antitumor CD8 T cells. My postdoctoral work demonstrated\nthat reactivating childhood vaccine-specific CD4 T cells after intratumor injection of recall antigen (e.g. polio\ncapsid or tetanus toxoid), mediates antitumor efficacy and causes both innate and adaptive inflammation within\ntumors. The antitumor efficacy of intratumor recall responses were partially dependent upon CD8 T cells, and\ncoincided with infiltration of activated granulocytic macrophages with phenotypes distinct from tumor associated\nmacrophages after direct innate stimulation with Poly IC. Thus, inducing CD4 T cell recall represents a novel\ntherapeutic opportunity, with a distinct mode of inflammatory and antitumor potential. We hypothesize that\nintratumor childhood vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell recall responses instigate distinct and durable inflammatory\nreprograming of myeloid cells to potentiate antitumor CD8+ T cell function and mediate antitumor efficacy. To\ntest this hypothesis, we will define reprogramming of innate immunity after triggering intratumor recall responses\nand determine its role in mediating antitumor efficacy (Aim 1) and test if polio vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell recall\nresponses `help' antitumor CD8+ T cells (Aim 2). These analyses will inform clinically actionable routes to develop\nrecall antigen-based therapies that enlist CD4 T cell help within tumors (the goal of the independent, R00 phase).\nThe clinical translation of these findings will be informed by identifying therapeutic strategies, such as combined\ninnate pattern recognition receptor agonist therapy, that may synergize with recall antigens in mediating systemic\nantitumor efficacy; as well as identifying more targeted molecular routes to recapitulate CD4 T cell help in tumors\ntherapeutically (Aim 3). The K99 phase of this work will be mentored by several distinguished experts in tumor\nimmunobiology and cancer immunotherapy: including Drs. Darell Bigner (primary Mentor, cancer immunotherapy\nof brain tumors), Simon Gregory (computational expert), Qi Jing-Li (T cell biologist using transcriptome analyses\nto gauge T cell function), Amy Heimberger (tumor associated myeloid cell expert who has previously applied\ntranscriptome analyses to define activation/suppressive features of tumor associated myeloid cells), and James\nHerndon II (biostatistical support). This proposal will enable clinical translation of recall antigens to cancer\npatients and will seed a research program that leverages the potent immune-stimulating effects of CD4+ T cell\nhelp to develop novel cancer therapies.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant RNA modification, plays key roles in\nRNA metabolism, transcript stability, and translation efficiency. Aberrant regulation of m6A writers and erasers\ncontributes to leukemogenesis, though the exact mechanisms how the methyltransferase machinery is altered\nin leukemia remains to be shown. Mutations in methyltransferase writers have not been identified to date, with\none exception: in the recurrent t(1;22) translocation in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) a component\nof the m6A writer machinery, RBM15, is fused with MKL1, a transcriptional cofactor of serum response factor\n(SRF). Understanding the mechanism by which the RBM15-MKL1 (RM) fusion protein causes leukemia will shed\nlight on the role of disordered m6A RNA methylation in leukemogenesis, specifically AMKL but also AML and to\ncancer in general. We hypothesize that for RM-associated AMKL to develop, the MKL1 domain aberrantly targets\nRBM15 activity to sites of SRF binding and that RBM15 recruits the m6A writer complex to associated RNAs,\naltering m6A mRNA methylation and expression of genes that are required for transformation and/or are\nimportant for megakaryocyte fate commitment and maturation. We propose focused, unbiased genome-wide\nstudies to determine how the m6A epitranscriptome and the SRF transcriptional networks are coopted in RBM15-\nMKL1 AMKL. The functional effects of candidate target genes common to the genomic approaches (m6A RNA\nimmunoprecipitation, chromatin mapping, RNA stability assays, and mapping of the translatome) as well as the\nrelevance of critical domains in RM-mediated leukemogenesis will be tested with assays of growth, differentiation\nand oncogene dependence in RM-induced murine AMKL as well as primary human AMKL patient derived\nxenotransplants (PDX). The studies are highly clinically relevant as they address a unique mechanism causative\nof AMKL via comprehensive analysis of fundamental biologic mechanisms, and will reveal previously unidentified\nregulation of the epitranscriptome that may be a novel shared oncogenic mechanism in AML and other cancers.\nThe proposed approaches are multifaceted, using cell lines as well as genetically engineered animal models,\nand primary human and murine leukemia samples. The studies will contribute to our understanding of\nleukemogenesis by elucidating the direct role of a component of the m6A RNA methylase complex in leukemia\nshedding light on the broader role of m6A mRNA modifications in AML.\n!

This is true both in\ninternational comparisons of rates of ALL in African nations to those elsewhere, and in comparing rate of B-ALL\nin African-American (AA) children to that in European-American (EA) children in the United States. The inverse\nassociation of African ancestry with incidence of B-ALL is independent of established perinatal risk factors for\nthe disease. Moreover, AA children have lower incidence despite having greater exposure to many putatively\ncausal environmental risk factors for B-ALL than do EA children. Common genetic variants established by\ngenomewide association studies incompletely explain the deficit of B-ALL in AA children, suggesting\nundiscovered contributing genetic factors may be detected by admixture mapping. We have assembled existing\nDNA samples and data for 930 B-ALL patients with AA ancestry and will additionally accrue ~590 over the life\nof the project. We will conduct admixture mapping in the assembled group of patients to detect new genetic loci\nand new variants at established loci associated with occurrence of B-ALL. In addition, we will examine admixture\nin association with clinical characteristics at diagnosis and survival. Candidate genes/variants will be functionally\nevaluated through both in silico and in vitro techniques. The proposed research will potentially answer a long-\nstanding mystery by revealing critical genes or loci that explain the comparative deficit of B-ALL in AA compared\nto EA children. In addition, we may uncover genes or variants associated with the worse characteristics at\npresentation in AA patients as well as with worse survival, which will indicate avenues for improving outcome\namong AA children.

Accordingly, the study of cancer\npredisposing genes and their associated hereditary syndromes provides critical insights into normal physiology\nand cancer biology. By investigating families with autosomal dominant transmission of thrombocytopenia and B-\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we and others identified pathogenic germline variants affecting ETV6,\nthe gene encoding the ETS variant 6 transcriptional repressor. Subsequently, we sequenced germline samples\nfrom 4,405 children with B-ALL and detected similar variants in 0.5% of patients. Further association studies\nrevealed a significant 22.94-fold enrichment of pathogenic ETV6 variants in this ALL cohort compared to 134,187\nnon-ALL controls in gnomAD (P= 2.2 × 10-16). These data firmly support our overall premise that pathogenic\ngermline ETV6 variants predispose to childhood ALL. To better understand how germline ETV6 variants\npromote leukemogenesis, we used in vitro assays to interrogate their effects on the functions of the encoded\nETV6 protein. Notably, each of the pathogenic ETV6 variants examined significantly reduced ETV6 transcription\nrepressor activity, impaired ETV6 DNA binding capacity and mis-localized ETV6 to the cytoplasm. In parallel, we\ngenerated a novel mouse model harboring a recurrent B-ALL-associated Etv6 variant (Etv6R355X). Preliminary\nstudies of Etv6R355X/+ mice reveal significant perturbations in early B cell development, as well as hematopoietic\nstem and progenitor cell (HSPC) number and function. Finally, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent stem\ncell (iPSC) lines harboring pathogenic ETV6 variants, which generate dysplastic megakaryocytes, similar to\nETV6 variant positive patients. Based on these results, we hypothesize that ETV6 variants predispose to\nALL by perturbing key transcriptional programs that impair hematopoietic development. In this proposal,\nwe will make use of our unique model systems to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize\nthe hematopoietic compartments of humans and mice that do or do not harbor pathogenic germline ETV6\nvariants. We will examine whether WT and ETV6 variant-positive iPSCs or mouse hematopoietic progenitors\nproperly differentiate along various lineages. To establish how germline ETV6 variants influence gene expression\nin developing hematopoietic progenitors, in Aim 2 we will use RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing to explore\ntranscriptional landscapes and identify putative ETV6 target genes in mouse and iPSC-derived B progenitors\nand HSPC harboring WT or variant ETV6. Finally, in Aim 3 we will perform comprehensive whole genome and\nRNA-sequencing of B-ALL samples to elucidate the somatic genetic lesions that function in concert with germline\nETV6 variants to drive B-leukemogenesis. We will use in vitro and in vivo approaches to assess the leukemia-\npromoting effects of these second hits. This project will provide new insights into the influence of germline\ngenetic variation on hematopoiesis and development of B-ALL, the most common childhood cancer.

project	1R01CA254892-01A1	R01CA254892	10269365	2021	Improving pediatric brain tumor treatments using FLASH radiotherapy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\n Our R01 application entitled, “Improving pediatric brain tumor treatments using FLASH radiotherapy” is\n focused on translating a novel irradiation modality into clinical practice. Here we will test whether radiation\n delivered in ultra-high dose rate (one-tenth of second), which far exceed the dose rate used in current clinical\n practice (minutes), can significantly reduce normal tissue toxicities associated with the radiotherapeutic\n management of childhood medulloblastoma (MB). The overarching goal is to alleviate the long term\n neurocognitive and cerebrovascular complications that compromise the quality of life of MB survivors while\n maintaining tumor control. To achieve these goals, we will undertake studies using clinically relevant FLASH\n and conventional radiation regimens. Two distinct human MB tumor models will be orthotopically implanted\n in the brain of nude mice to investigate simultaneously tumor response and neurocognitive function after\n irradiation. In addition, for long-term follow up, tumor-free mice will also be subjected to cranial irradiation\n using FLASH or conventional dose rate irradiation. Short-term (1-month) and longer term (4-6 months) studies\n conducted on tumor bearing and tumor free mice respectively, will critically evaluate tumor control,\n neurocognitive, cerebrovascular and molecular outcomes in these cohorts. Preclinical studies investigating the\n response of MB tumors, behavioral performance on multiple learning and memory tasks, vascular structure and\n integrity and the sparing of the neurogenic niche will unambiguously elucidate many of the mechanisms\n underlying the neuroprotective effects of FLASH radiotherapy. Data derived from these collaborative studies\n between UCI and the CHUV will facilitate the clinical translation of FLASH-RT to pediatric oncology, where\n despite the favorable prognosis of children diagnosed with MB, survivors still suffer a lifetime of complications\n caused by their prior radiotherapy, a scenario we hope to ameliorate with our innovative FLASH technology.

Unfortunately, many survivors now live with life-long side\neffects from treatment itself. Radiation therapy, used for brain tumors, is particularly damaging. The most\nserious side effect is necrosis which can result in weakness, paralysis or even death. Proton therapy is an\nincreasingly popular radiation modality. Proton therapy reduces exposure to normal tissues and the reby\nmay decrease the incidence of cognitive deficits following radiation. However, recent studies, including our\nown suggest that certain areas of proton beams may be more damaging to brain tissue than others\npotentially leading to higher rates of necrosis. Here we will develop high accuracy models to correlate\nnecrosis with the physical parameters of proton beams. These models will include multi-cell type human\nbrain “organoids” as well as rodent animal models. Using these models as well as clinical data, we will\nidentify the physical factors of proton therapy which may lead to necrosis. This is significant in that this data\nmay be used to design safer proton therapy treatments in which the most biologically effective portions of\nbeams are solely placed within the tumor. This should reduce necrosis and improve disease control. In a\nsecond component of our study, we will examine the molecular mechanisms of necrosis. Rather than being\nsimple dis-organized death, we will determine if radiation induces an orderly programmed cell death\npathway. We will conduct the following aims; (1) relate the physical factors of proton beams with biological\nresponse, (2) explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms of radiation induced brain damage and (3)\nvalidate the clinical consequences of variability in the effectiveness of proton beams. The knowledge gained\nwill quickly influence the treatment of brain tumor patients and expedite the clinical introduction of agents\nand approaches to combat the negative effects of radiation on the brain.	3-Dimensional;Adult;Adverse effects;Animal Model;Animals;Apoptosis;Area;Biological;Biological Factors;Biological Markers;Brain;Brain Injuries;Brain Neoplasms;Cancerous;Cell Death;Cells;Cerebrum;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Childhood;Childhood Ependymoma;Clinical;Clinical Data;Coculture Techniques;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Cranial Irradiation;Data;Dependence;Disease model;Distal;Dose;Educational workshop;Effectiveness;Engineering;Exposure to;Glioma;Human;Image;In Vitro;Incidence;Inflammatory;Intensity modulated proton therapy;Intervention;Knowledge;Laboratories;Laboratory Study;Lead;Life;Linear Energy Transfer;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Mission;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;National Cancer Institute;Necrosis;Necrosis Induction;Normal tissue morphology;Organoids;Outcome;Paralysed;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Photons;Planning Techniques;Preparation;Prevention;Process;Protons;Public Health;Radiation;Radiation Injuries;Radiation necrosis;Radiation therapy;Relative Biological Effectiveness;Research;Research Support;Rodent;Roentgen Rays;Role;Scanning;Signal Transduction;Survivors;Techniques;Tissues;Transgenic Animals;Treatment Side Effects;Uncertainty;brain cell;brain tissue;cancer cell;cancer rehabilitation;cancer therapy;cell injury;cell type;clinical investigation;clinical practice;clinically relevant;combat;design;disorder control;high risk;imaging platform;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;induced pluripotent stem cell;insight;irradiation;medulloblastoma;novel;pediatric patients;pre-clinical;predictive modeling;proton beam;proton therapy;radiation effect;radiation response;radiation risk;response;side effect;treatment planning;treatment response;tumor	UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR	HOUSTON	TX	UNITED STATES	DAVID R GROSSHANS	DCTD	Pat G Prasanna	174886	<$250k	174886	2-Aug-2021	2-Aug-2021	31-Jul-2026	PAR-19-325	CCDI
project	1R01CA255643-01A1	R01CA255643	10298611	2021	Leveraging Tumor Suppressor Inactivation for Osteosarcoma Therapy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nOsteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor, found in the pediatric\npopulation and often leads to death due to tumor progression and metastasis. Despite\nintensive, multimodality treatment protocols with cytotoxic chemotherapy and aggressive\nsurgery, 30-40% of patients still succumb to relapsed and metastatic disease. Current\ntreatment options for these patients are extremely limited. More importantly, the clinical\noutcome for OS patients has not improved at all during the last four decades. Our long-range\ngoals are to reduce OS disease burden and improve long-term survival by developing\nmolecular-based therapies that target mechanisms of tumor growth and metastasis. The F-box\nprotein s-phase kinase-associated protein-2 (Skp2) is the substrate recognition component of\nthe Skp1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) complex and considered a key oncogene through its ability to\ntarget cell cycle regulators for ubiquitin degradation, regulates cell migration and metastasis.\nSkp2 interacts with the accessory protein Cks1 to ubiquitinate p27 for degradation, thus\npromoting cell cycle progression and cancer growth. Currently, the oncogenic mechanisms\nand therapeutic potential of Skp2 in OS is largely unknown. There are specific and rational\nreasons for targeting the SCF-Skp2 axis in OS, based upon preliminary data generated by the\nPI and his colleagues: (1) A high Skp2 expression in OS tissues portends a poor prognosis in\npatients; (2) High levels of Skp2 are observed in many OS cell types, including established cell\nlines, patient-derived xenografts, and primary cultures from OS patients; (3) Skp2 deletion\neffectively blocks pituitary and prostate tumorigenesis in Rb1/p53-deficient mouse models. In\nOS, genomic sequencing studies reveal a high rate of Rb1/p53 co-inactivation, suggesting that\nOS may be susceptible to Skp2 blockade; (4) Genetic and drug-induced depletion of Skp2\nreduces the proliferation and invasion of OS cell lines and; (5) Mouse embryonic fibroblasts\n(MEF) and OS tumor cells with Rb1/p53 deletion are more sensitive to SCF-Skp2 inhibition\nthan wild-type and Skp2-deleted cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the SCF-Skp2\ncomplex may offer a unique therapeutic opportunity for treating a tremendously challenging\ncancer such as OS. We hypothesize that blockade of the SCF-Skp2 complex in the context of\nRb1/p53 inactivation will reduce OS progression. This hypothesis will be addressed by the\nfollowing specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (Oncogenic Mechanisms): To define the pro-oncogenic\nmechanisms of SCF-Skp2 in Rb1/p53-inactivated OS. Specific Aim 2 (Translational\nTherapeutics): To determine the effect of inhibiting SCF-Skp2 in preclinical models of Rb1/p53-\ninactivated OS. Finally, since cancer organoids represent an emerging technology that\nfaithfully replicates the tumor's genetic landscape, we will examine the effect of inhibiting SCF-\nSkp2 in mouse OS organoids as a proof-of-concept to translate findings into patient-specific\ntherapeutics in the future. The successful completion of this study will be translatable to target\nthe SCF-Skp2 complex to block osteosarcoma progression.\n	Address;Alanine;Amputation;Animals;Apoptosis;Cell Cycle;Cell Cycle Progression;Cell Line;Cells;Cessation of life;Childhood;Clinical;Combined Modality Therapy;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Data;Defect;Disease;Dose-Limiting;Embryo;Emerging Technologies;F Box Domain;F-Box Proteins;Fibroblasts;Future;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Goals;Growth;Histologic;Immunoblotting;Implant;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Malignant Bone Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pituitary gland;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Mediating;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Lung;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organoids;Osteoblasts;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Pituitary Gland;Play;Population;Positioning Attribute;Pre-Clinical Model;Prognosis;Proteins;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;Randomized;Relapse;Role;Skp2 Proteins;Survival Rate;TP53 gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Threonine;Tissues;Translating;Treatment Protocols;Treatment-related toxicity;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;base;burden of illness;cell motility;cell type;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B;established cell line;immunoregulation;implantation;improved;innovation;insight;mouse model;multicatalytic endopeptidase complex;neoplastic cell;next generation sequencing;novel;novel therapeutics;osteosarcoma;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;prostate carcinogenesis;screening;side effect;stemness;targeted treatment;transcriptome;transcriptomics;translational impact;treatment effect;treatment group;tumor;tumor growth;tumor progression;tumorigenesis	ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE	BRONX	NY	UNITED STATES	BANG H HOANG	DCTD	Sudhir B Kondapaka	420442	$250k to $499k	420442	21-Jun-2021	1-Jul-2021	30-Jun-2025	PA-20-185	CCDI

Prevention, therefore, remains the ultimate goal. An essential part of future preventive\nefforts will involve identifying children harboring preleukemic clones at birth. Several leukemia-initiating genetic\nlesions have been shown to arise prenatally; however, many other leukemia-initiating lesions have not been\nexamined at birth. Several critical questions remain to be answered: 1) What subtypes and what proportion of\nchildhood leukemia develops in utero? 2) What is the specific cell(s) of origin in which preleukemic clones arise?\nand 3) Are some newborns more prone to developing leukemia-initiating lesions than others? In this project, we\nwill answer these questions, with a focus on the ~70% of patients with known translocation or point mutation driver\nevents. This project has three main aims. Aim 1: To identify the presence and clonal frequency of prenatal\nleukemia-initiating lesions at birth. We will obtain matched cord blood (CB) and diagnostic leukemia samples from\n~250 childhood leukemia patients in the Children’s Oncology Group Project:Every Child study. Backtracking will\nfocus on ~182 patients with translocation/mutation-driven subtypes. We derive patient-specific somatic mutations\nfrom tumor profiling, then use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in flow-sorted CB cells to confirm the presence and\nfrequency of leukemia-initiating lesions at birth, and at different hematopoietic stages. We will also use ddPCR to\nbacktrack lesions in available newborn dried bloodspots (N ~45). Aim 2: To determine the cell of origin of leukemia-\ninitiating lesions, the transcriptomic changes from preleukemia to overt leukemia, and whether secondary\nmutations arise prenatally, across childhood leukemia subtypes. In 50 childhood leukemia patients where CB\nddPCR is positive we will conduct single-cell TARGET-seq on flow-sorted cell populations to simultaneously detect\nthe presence of each patient-specific leukemia-initiating events, secondary mutations, and gene expression in\ngenotypically- and immunophenotypically-defined populations at a single cell level. Aim 3: To determine whether\nthe presence and frequency of preleukemic clones correlate with known risk factors for leukemia. Demographic,\nperinatal, and genetic risk factors for childhood leukemia will be obtained through parental survey, birth records,\nand sequencing data. For overall ALL and AML, and for common subtypes, we will test for association between\nrisk factors and the presence and clonal frequency of preleukemic clones at birth, as measured in Aim 1. Identifying\na specific cell of origin of preleukemic genomic alterations, and their frequency in neonatal blood, will shed light on\nchildhood leukemia etiology and have important implications for precision prevention efforts. This study will identify\nkey steps required for leukemogenesis by directly comparing the genetic and transcriptomic architecture of\npreleukemic CB to the subsequent full-blown leukemia. Results will provide a platform for development of large-\nscale population testing of preleukemic clones in healthy newborns and will enable the first cohort studies\nexamining progression from pre- to overt leukemia.	15 year old;Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Acute leukemia;Architecture;Biological Assay;Birth;Birth Records;Blood;Blood Cells;Blood specimen;CBFA2T1 gene;CD34 gene;Cause of Death;Cells;Cesarean section;Child;Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Childhood Leukemia;Cohort Studies;DNA Sequence Alteration;Data;Development;Diagnostic;ETV6 gene;Eligibility Determination;Ethnic Origin;Etiology;Event;Face;Frequencies;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Fusion;Generations;Genetic;Genotype;Goals;Hematopoietic;Infant;Lesion;Light;MLL gene;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Measures;Morbidity - disease rate;Mutation;Natural History;Neonatal;Neonatal Screening;Newborn Infant;Parental Ages;Patients;Pediatric Oncology Group;Perinatal;Point Mutation;Population;Preleukemia;Prevention;Preventive;RUNX1 gene;Race;Resolution;Risk Factors;Sampling;Somatic Mutation;Surveys;Survivors;Testing;Umbilical Cord Blood;cell type;digital;disorder risk;driver mutation;epidemiology study;genetic risk factor;genome sequencing;high risk;in utero;indexing;individualized prevention;leukemia;leukemogenesis;prenatal;progenitor;risk prediction model;screening;sex;stem;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;tumor;whole genome	UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA	MINNEAPOLIS	MN	UNITED STATES	Adam  De Smith,Logan G.

project	1R01CA262250-01	R01CA262250	10277506	2021	CAR NKT Cell Immunotherapy of Neuroblastoma	Grant	Abstract\nDespite remarkable progress in treating B cell malignancies, T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors\n(CARs) remain largely ineffective in solid tumors. We demonstrated that unlike conventional T and CAR-T cells,\nV24-invariant natural killer T cells (NKTs) and CAR-NKTs effectively traffic to tumor sites in xenogeneic models\nof neuroblastoma (NB), which led to initiation of a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial evaluating autologous GD2-\nspecific CAR-NKTs in children with NB. Interim results from this trial have shown that the treatment is well-\ntolerated and produces antitumor activity, underscoring the need for systematic investigation of NKTs as an\nalternative cellular platform for CAR-redirected immunotherapy. We reported that repeated antigenic stimulation\nof NKTs and CAR-NKTs leads to their effector-like differentiation, exhaustion, and loss of antitumor activity. Our\npreliminary data demonstrate that Wnt signaling—specifically, activation of transcription factor LEF1—is required\nand sufficient for maintenance of the CD62L+ central memory-like NKT subset and is associated with NKT\nmetabolic and functional fitness. These findings provide rationale for examining the role and potential therapeutic\ntargeting of LEF1 in CAR-NKTs for cancer immunotherapy. Pre-clinical in vivo studies of CAR-NKTs have been\nlimited to xenogeneic models, which do not allow for evaluation of the full spectrum of downstream innate and\nadaptive immune responses. To address this gap, we have developed protocols to generate and expand highly\npure murine NKTs that express a murine CAR targeting the GD2 antigen expressed on human and murine NB\ncells. We have also adapted a syngeneic NB model that faithfully recapitulates the clinical and pathological\ncharacteristics of high-risk NB in children. We hypothesize that 1) LEF1 transcriptional activity is required for\nand can be therapeutically enhanced to maintain CAR-NKT cell metabolic fitness, in vivo persistence, and\ndurable antitumor activity; and 2) CAR-NKT antitumor activity depends on direct targeting of tumor cells, control\nof tumor-associated macrophages, transactivation of NK cells and induction of tumor-specific T cells. These\nhypotheses will be tested in the following specific aims: 1) to examine and therapeutically explore the\nmechanism responsible for maintenance of human central memory-like NKT and CAR-NKT cells, and 2) to\nexplore the mechanism by which CAR-NKTs mediate antitumor activity in a syngeneic NB model. We will use\ngenetic loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches to study the role of LEF1 in CAR-NKT functional\ndifferentiation, metabolism, and antitumor activity using in vitro experimental systems with human cells and in\nvivo xenogeneic NB models in mice. To study the mechanism by which CAR-NKTs mediate antitumor activity in\nthe syngeneic setting, we will perform a side-by-side comparison of murine NKTs and T cells expressing a GD2-\nspecifc CAR. The proposed experiments will mechanistically dissect the contributions of the native NKT cell\nTCR, the tumor-specific CAR, and therapy-induced innate and adaptive immune responses. The results will\ninform development of next-generation CAR-NKT immunotherapy for NB and other types of cancer.

project	1R01CA262887-01	R01CA262887	10279241	2021	Image-guided combination therapies for radiotherapy-induced neurocognitive impairment in pediatric brain tumor survivors	Grant	Approximately 90% of pediatric central nervous system tumor (CNST) survivors, treated with radiotherapy,\nexperience radiotherapy-induced brain injury (RIBI) and neurocognitive decline later in life. This is a progressive\ntreatment-related side effect, which impacts the quality of life of pediatric CNST survivors. Since more pediatric\npatients are surviving cancer, there is a growing need for RIBI prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Chronic\noxidative stress and neuroinflammation are key contributors to RIBI. Thus, neuroprotective strategies to reduce\noxidative stress and neuroinflammation are being explored. Neuroengineering strategies using regenerative\nstem cells to repair RIBI are also being explored. However, prolonging the survival of transplanted stem cells at\ninjury sites is a challenge, partly due to chronic oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Accordingly, strategies\nto improve transplanted stem cell survival are on the horizon. For these strategies to be effective, drug delivery\nsystems capable of effectively delivering neuroprotective drugs to brain injuries are greatly needed. Also critical\nfor clinical translation efforts are methods to noninvasively image drug delivery and tissue responses to therapy.\nNanotechnology in combination with image-guided neuro-interventional procedures are promising for drug\ndelivery. In addition, diamagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (CEST\nMRI) is a promising MRI technique that can be used to noninvasively and directly image organic drugs. Although,\nCEST MRI is based on a magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) technique, it is more sensitive (~1000 times)\nthan MRS. Furthermore, given the inherent correlation between CEST MRI signals, pH, and oxidative stress, it\ncan also be used to image changes in tissue oxidative stress, in response to effective drug delivery. We propose\nto develop CEST MRI theranostic biosensors and complementary CEST MRI nanotheranostic agents for image-\nguided combination therapy of RIBI. In Aim 1, neuroprotective drugs will be screened by CEST MRI, and each\ndrug’s potential to serve as a pH-dependent CEST MRI theranostic biosensor will be evaluated in our preclinical\nRIBI model. The feasibility of imaging changes in tissue oxidative stress in vivo with the CEST MRI theranostic\nagents will also be evaluated. In Aim 2, we will develop oxidative stress-activable CEST MRI nanotheranostic\nbiosensors and evaluate each agent’s potential to sustainably reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in\nour RIBI model. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the feasibility of improving transplanted stem cell survival and\nneurorepair in our RIBI model, by sustainably reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Stem cell\nsurvival will be imaged with our stem cell tracking MRI biosensor, capable of noninvasively imaging stem cell\ndelivery, migration and survival. All results will be validated with multi-parametric MRI; PET imaging of\nneuroinflammation, using the translocator protein radiotracer [(11)C]DPA-713; behavioral tests of memory and\nlearning; histology and immunohistochemistry. This project will advance the development of neuroprotective and\nneuroengineering strategies for RIBI in pediatric CNS survivors, ultimately improving their quality of life.

project	1R01CA263500-01	R01CA263500	10279921	2021	Developing Safe and Effective GD2-CAR T Cell Therapy for Diffuse Midline Gliomas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nBrain tumors are the leading cause of cancer related death in children; among these, diffuse intrinsic pontine\nglioma (DIPG) and other histone-3 K27M (H3K27M) mutated diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are the most\naggressive and are universally fatal with current standard therapies. Despite several decades of investigational\ntrials testing dozens of therapeutic approaches, median overall survival for DIPG is 11 months. Chimeric antigen\nreceptor (CAR)-expressing T-cells have mediated impressive clinical activity in B-cell malignancies, and recent\npreclinical and early clinical results suggest benefit in CNS malignancies. We discovered homogenous, high\noverexpression of the GD2 ganglioside on H3K27M DMGs and demonstrated impressive antitumor effects in\nxenograft models of H3K27M-mutant DIPG following treatment with GD2-CAR T cells (GD2-CART, Mount, Nat\nMed 2018). Significant clinical experience with GD2 targeting CAR T cells, available mostly from studies in\nneuroblastoma, demonstrate safety and some early signals of antitumor activity. Safe and effective translation\nof these findings to children with DMGs would transform the landscape for this universally lethal pediatric brain\ntumor. This bench-to-bedside-to-bench project will conduct three aims in parallel leveraging a recently launched\nsingle institution Phase I trial of GD2.BB.z.iCasp9-CAR T cells administered intravenously following a\nlymphodepleting preparative regimen in children and young adults with H3K27M DMGs. The first aim focuses\non safety, integrating insights gleaned in our preclinical models into trial design to diminish the risk of tumor\ninflammation associated neurotoxicity (TIAN), to establish best practices and to develop improved grading and\ntreatment algorithms for this novel toxicity. The second aim focuses on efficacy, assessing clinical activity of\nGD2-CART in DMG and identifying biomarkers and clinical features associated with response. We further\naddress the limitations of standard radiographic imaging in these infiltrative tumors using a novel machine\nlearning aided MRI radiomics approach to quantify textural changes within the tumor and assess whether such\nchanges correlate with clinical outcome, and we assess whether GD2-CART induced changes in CSF cell free\nDNA can provide a rapid quantitative assessment of antitumor response. Our third aim is a discovery aim,\nfocused on improving understanding of the biology associated with myeloid cell activation following GD2-CART\ntherapy for DMGs, which we observe in preclinical models and we observed in the first patient treated. Here we\nundertake comprehensive single cell profiling of CSF myeloid cells emerging post-GD2-CART in patients\nenrolled on the study and in preclinical models, and bedside-to-bench translation using murine models to test\nthe hypotheses that GD2-CART induced CNS myeloid cell expansion/activation limit the efficacy of GD2-CART,\nare modulated by corticosteroid therapy and that this obstacle can be overcome by engineering CD47\noverexpression in the GD2-CART.

TERT oncogene rearrangement with transcriptional super-enhancers leads to substantial TERT\nover-expression and neuroblastoma in high-risk neuroblastoma patients. Telomerase inhibitors show little\nanticancer effects and cause life-threatening side effects in childhood brain cancer patients in clinical trials.\nThe transcriptional kinases CDK7 and CDK9 play critical roles in super-enhancer-associated oncogene\ntranscriptional initiation, pause release and elongation respectively, and CKIα induce p53 protein degradation.\nThe CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51 suppresses super-enhancer-associated oncogene expression and\nactivates p53 protein expression, resulting in leukemia regression in mice with no toxicity to normal tissues.\nPreliminary Data. We have found that CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-knockdown with shRNAs or treatment with the\nCDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51 considerably reduced TERT gene expression and MDM2 protein\nexpression, activated p53 protein expression, and induced substantial apoptosis in TERT oncogene-\nrearranged neuroblastoma, but not normal cells. Analysis of a RNA sequencing gene expression-patient\nprognosis dataset from 493 neuroblastoma patients, showed that high levels of CDK7 gene expression in\nhuman tumor tissues positively correlated with high levels of TERT gene expression, and that high levels of\nCDK7 and CKIα expression in human neuroblastoma tissues correlated with poor patient prognosis.\nSpecific Aims. (1) To identify the critical roles of CDK7 and CDK9 in inducing TERT gene transcriptional\ninitiation, elongation and over-expression and CKIα in inducing p53 protein degradation in TERT-rearranged\nneuroblastoma cells; (2) To identify the critical roles of CDK7, CDK9 and CKIα in TERT-rearranged\nneuroblastoma cell proliferation and survival in vitro and tumor progression in vivo; (3) To define the anticancer\nefficacy of the CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51 against TERT-rearranged neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo.\nOutcomes and Significance. We hope to demonstrate that CDK7 and CDK9 co-operatively induce TERT\ngene transcriptional initiation, pause release, elongation and over-expression, and CKIα induces p53 protein\ndegradation; that CDK7, CDK9 and CKIα co-operatively induce TERT-rearranged neuroblastoma cell\nproliferation and survival in vitro and tumor progression in vivo; and that the CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51\nefficiently blocks TERT gene transcriptional initiation, pause release, elongation and expression, activates p53\nprotein expression, induces neuroblastoma cell apoptosis in vitro, and blocks tumor progression and causes\ntumor regression in mice xenografted with TERT-rearranged neuroblastoma cell lines or patient-derived\nneuroblastoma tissues. As A51 is currently in clinical trials in leukemia patients, completion of this project will\nprovide the vital evidence for clinical trials of A51 therapy in patients with TERT gene-rearranged\nneuroblastoma, against which no targeted therapy is now available for, or has ever be tested in, clinical trials.

Thus, the primary\ngoal in the treatment of T-ALL is to prevent relapse, which requires accurate risk stratification. Unfortunately, no\ngenetic alterations have been identified to date that are reproducibly prognostic independent of minimal residual\ndisease (MRD), making it difficult at diagnosis to identify which patients are more likely to relapse. AALL0434\nwas a Children's Oncology Group-initiated phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing Capizzi-style escalating\nmethotrexate plus pegaspargase (CMTX) vs. high dose methotrexate (HDMTX), with/without six 5-day courses\nof nelarabine. Survival on this study was superior to any prior trial for de novo T-ALL, changing the standard of\ncare. Yet, a substantial minority (~15%) of patients had relapsed or refractory (r/r) disease. Our group recently\nreceived an X01/Gabriella Miller Kids First award to perform comprehensive genomic profiling on 1262 cases of\nT-ALL treated on the AALL0434 clinical trial (1X01HD100702-01). This includes whole genome sequencing\n(WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), and transcriptome profiling (RNAseq) of tumor and WGS of germline.\nWe have separately performed copy number analysis (SNP) on germline samples that will be integrated with\nthis work. We hypothesize that comprehensive genomic profiling of the entire AALL0434 cohort will identify\nrecurrent genetic alterations that can be segregated into biologically relevant deregulated pathways that can be\ncombined with MRD to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes before they relapse and provide rationale for\ntreatment with alternative therapies. In addition, a number of small recent studies demonstrated that many of the\nbiologically relevant alterations in T-ALL occur in non-coding regions of the genome, but no large studies have\nperformed whole genome sequencing in T-ALL. We further hypothesize that whole genome sequencing of a\nlarge cohort of patients with T-ALL will identify novel lesions in coding and non-coding regions that will be highly\nimpactful in the understanding of T-ALL pathogenesis. We will test our hypotheses with the following specific\naims: (1) identify recurrent genetic alterations that predict poor outcome in T-ALL; (2) identify novel alterations,\nincluding non-coding alterations in T-ALL; and (3) identify germline genetic variants that predispose to T-ALL.\nThe goal of the Kids First Program is improve understanding of genetic mechanisms of disease, leading to\nimproved diagnostic capabilities and ultimately more targeted therapies or interventions. This proposal will meet\nthat important goal through identification of germline and somatic alterations in T-ALL that can be used to identify\npatients that are likely to relapse before they relapse and can be treated with new therapies.

project	1R15CA263868-01	R15CA263868	10290439	2021	Determining the significance of the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction in neuroblastoma.	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nNeuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor found in infants, with almost all cases\nbeing diagnosed by the age of five. The most severe cases of neuroblastoma are linked to amplification of\nthe N-MYC oncogene, which occurs in ~20% of all NB. N-MYC amplification is associated with ~50%\noverall survival despite aggressive multimodal therapies, highlighting the need for new targeted therapies to\ncombat this pediatric cancer. N-MYC, like any MYC protein, must be able to recognize and bind chromatin\nin order to activate its oncogenic potential. This project is built on the premise that an essential co-factor for\nMYC proteins called WDR5 acts to recruit N-MYC to chromatin at genes that work to maintain\nneuroblastoma function, and that targeting the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction can serve as a focal point for anti-\nN-MYC based therapies. Support for this hypothesis comes from published data showing that WDR5 is a\nconserved regulator of protein synthesis genes across multiple cellular contexts where WDR5 binds and\nregulates these loci through its so-called “WIN”-site. In addition, the MYC family member, c-MYC, requires\nWDR5 to bind genes associated with biomass accumulation and translation, and the c-MYC-WDR5\ninteraction is essential for tumor maintenance in lymphoma mouse models. In an N-MYC amplified NB cell\nline, preliminary data reveal that targeting the WIN-site of WDR5 using small molecule inhibitors results in a\ngenome-wide decrease in WDR5 binding, with a subsequent loss of N-MYC binding at specific N-MYC-\nWDR5 co-bound genes. And, importantly, disrupting the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction using genetic mutants\nimpairs the ability of N-MYC to drive anchorage-independent growth, providing evidence that there are\nessential tumor functions tied to N-MYC that require interaction with WDR5. Together these data provide a\nsolid foundation for the notion that N-MYC requires WDR5 to bind and regulate N-MYC-WDR5 co-bound\ngenes that are important for driving N-MYC specific activities. The goal of this project is to interrogate the N-\nMYC-WDR5 interaction in N-MYC amplified neuroblastoma cell lines and determine the influence that\nWDR5 has on N-MYC driven transcriptional processes and neuroblastoma function using genetic and\nchemical perturbations. Specific Aim 1 will employ genetic and genomic approaches to identify the genes\nthat are bound by N-MYC and WDR5, and determine at which genes the recruitment of N-MYC is\ndependent on the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction. Specific Aim 2 will combine high-resolution transcriptomic\nanalyses with cellular and in vivo functional assays to challenge the significance of the N-MYC-WDR5\ninteraction. At the completion of these studies we will have identified the precise genes in which N-MYC\nbinding and transcription is regulated by the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction, and have directly challenged the\nsignificance of the N-MYC-WDR5 interactions on multiple facets of NB tumorigenesis.

Two\ntargets have been considered for Diffuse Midline Glioma H3 K27M-mutant tumors (previously Diffuse Intrinsic\nPontine Glioma (DIPG)), however as neither are exclusively restricted to neoplastic tissue, safety concerns\nexist with respect to on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Moreover, ancillary treatment meant to boost CAR T function\nto overcome a constellation of immune suppressive mechanisms associated with the solid tumor\nmicroenvironment also has the potential to exacerbate the problem. Our group has conducted extensive\npreclinical characterization of oncolytic viruses and has demonstrated them to be a highly effective\nimmunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. We propose to leverage the tumor tropism of ∆24\noncolytic adenovirus to deliver a CAR target along with CD40L. Our preliminary data indicates that oncolytic\nAd∆24-CD40L provides a significant therapeutic advantage in a GL261 glioma model as a monotherapy, and\nfurther, can potentiate CD19 CAR T therapy in a proof of concept combination setting against subcutaneous\nB16-CD19 tumors. The goal of this proposal is to develop a dual therapy approach which builds on direct\ntumor cell viral oncolysis and CAR T cytolysis, enhanced CAR T cell recruitment/activation by virus-mediated\ninflammation, and importantly, CD40L-mediated mobilization of endogenous antigen presenting cells, B cells\nand T cells. We will engineer an oncolytic vector to deliver titratable levels of CD40L using the E. coli DHFR\ndestabilizing domain, and an intracellularly truncated signaling-dead EGFRvIII molecule to be used in\nconjunction with safety tested EGFRvIII CAR T cells (Aim1). The safety and efficacy of the OV-CAR T\napproach will be evaluated in a genetically engineered immunocompetent model of DIPG (Aim 2). This project\nis expected to provide novel insight into how CD40L can mobilize an endogenous B cell and T cell response\nand support CAR T therapy. Together, we hope to capitalize on the properties of designer oncolytic viruses to\nmore broadly enable the use of CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors, and in particular apply existing safety\ntested immunotherapies to a devastating and urgent unmet clinical need.

We have recently revealed critical\ntranscriptional programs downstream of CIC-DUX4 that drive malignant phenotypes, including tumor growth\nand metastasis. Additionally, recent studies demonstrate that Capicua (CIC) protein expression is directly\nmodulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathway. The long-term goal of our\nlaboratory is to identify and dissect the critical molecular pathways that regulate fusion oncoprotein stability and\nexpression in human sarcoma. Our studies will reveal fusion oncoprotein-specific vulnerabilities that can\nfacilitate precision-based therapeutic design to improve outcomes for patients with universally lethal forms of\nsarcomas. The objective of this proposal is to fuse our expertise in Capicua (CIC) biology and MAPK signaling\nto develop the first precision-based therapeutic approach for CIC-DUX4 sarcomas. We hypothesize, that\ngenetic or pharmacologic MAPK activation will lead to the degradation of the CIC-DUX4 oncoprotein. Our\nrationale is based on our prior studies demonstrating MAPK-mediated regulation of wild-type (non-fused) CIC\nprotein expression in the context of human cancer. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1)\nhuman ERK physically interacts with nuclear CIC-DUX4; (Aim 2) MAPK-ERK pathway activation decreases\nCIC-fused oncoprotein stability, leading to degradation; and (Aim 3) pharmacologic activation of the MAPK\npathway decreases tumor cell survival through rapid degradation of the CIC-DUX4 fusion oncoprotein. The\nsignificance of these findings are highly impactful, as there are no effective therapeutic strategies to target CIC-\nDUX4 sarcomas, which remain lethal in the metastatic setting. Our proposal is innovative because we are\nleveraging our expertise in MAPK-signaling, transcription factor fusions, and Capicua biology to develop a\nprecision-based therapeutic approach to directly target and degrade a lethal fusion oncoprotein in sarcoma, an\nunmet scientific and clinical need.

The long-term goal of the Mossé\nand Maris translational research programs is to substantively improve neuroblastoma cure rates by developing\npatient-specific therapies that target the unique oncogenic drivers of each case. Within the context of the\nNational Cancer Institute’s Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) we propose a Neuroblastoma\nResearch Program built on richly annotated and highly characterized patient derived xenograft (PDX) and\nother recently developed murine models of this disease. The central hypothesis to be tested in this Program is\nthat neuroblastoma-specific oncogenic drivers and optimal immunotherapeutic targets can be defined and\nexploited through rationally designed therapies based on validated and clinically measurable biomarkers.\nThrough our dedicated focus on neuroblastoma and our central role in the former Pediatric Preclinical Testing\nProgram and Consortium, we have developed an investigative team and rich set of resources and reagents to\nbe uniquely positioned to achieve the goals of the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Here we propose to use a large (and\ngrowing) collection of PDX models that have been fully characterized with the most modern genomic\ntechnologies to address the challenge of prioritizing the large armamentarium of anti-cancer agents in\ndevelopment so that early phase biomarker-driven clinical trials can be designed with the objective of showing\npotent and specific anti-tumor activity. We propose three specific aims directed towards 1) developing and\ncharacterizing highly annotated models of human neuroblastoma; 2) performing preclinical trials with drugs\ndirected against defined therapeutic vulnerabilities in order to prioritize agents for the clinic, and 3) developing\nthe portfolio of preclinical data required for design of clinical trials with robust biomarkers for patient selection\nand monitoring. In collaboration with other preclinical testing programs, we will seek to determine if discoveries\nin our program are relevant to other childhood cancers and collaborate across disease groups on clinical\ndevelopment strategies. Thus, this Program will seek to shift the paradigm for how high-risk neuroblastoma\npatients are treated with the goal of substantively improving the outcomes, both in terms of cure rates, but also\nby decreasing the toxicity associated with current standards of care.

project	1U01CA263967-01	U01CA263967	10300341	2021	Pediatric Preclinical In Vivo Testing Center for Pediatric Sarcoma and Other Solid Tumors	Grant	ABSTRACT\nWith recent enactment of the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act, there is a\ngrowing impetus to identify pediatric indications for molecularly targeted drugs. Accordingly, there is a pressing\nneed for clinically relevant preclinical studies that can help prioritize pediatric indications for clinical application\nof nearly the entire universe of cancer drugs currently in development. To meet this need, we established a\npreclinical testing program that has created >300 genomically-characterized pediatric solid tumor patient-\nderived xenograft (PDX) models between the pediatric oncology programs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer\nCenter and University of California San Francisco. We propose to leverage this large portfolio of models across\na diversity of diseases, along with the deep expertise of the team, to establish a NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing\nProgram (Ped-In Vivo-TP) Research Team focused on pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas, renal tumors,\ndesmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) and other rare pediatric solid tumors. The Aims of this Research\nTeam are: Aim 1. Integrate with the Coordinating Center and other Research Teams to prioritize agents\nfor preclinical evaluation. We will leverage our team's translational expertise as well as existing connections\nto disease committees within cooperative groups to inform and facilitate new agent selection and preclinical\nevaluation in appropriate models to prioritize agents to advance into pediatric oncology clinical trials. Aim 2.\nUtilize PDX portfolios representative of disease heterogeneity to assess therapeutic agents. We will\nutilize the >300 PDX models from MSKCC and UCSF, supplemented with models from the PROXC consortium\nwhere necessary, to assess 8-10 therapeutic agents/year using study designs matched to the therapeutic\nquestion. All preclinical drug testing will be conducted at MSKCC. Aim 3. Align central and local data\nanalyses to ensure rigor in results reporting. For the purposes of prioritization, we will maintain equipoise in\nvalidating (“go”) or invalidating (“no go”) therapeutic hypotheses, and will complement central data analyses\nwith advanced local biostatistical expertise. Aim 4. Translational biomarker discovery. We will leverage the\ncombined expertise of our Research Team to identify clinically translatable biomarkers predictive of enhanced\nresponse or drug resistance. In some cases, predictive biomarkers may not be genetic, but instead will depend\non transcriptional or protein-based assays of target activity. In other cases, genomically identified biomarkers\nhave to be translated to clinically utilizable assays. Together, the expertise and capabilities of this Research\nTeam will support the rigorous evaluation of novel therapeutic hypotheses in clinically-representative models to\nenable prioritization and translation of the most promising emerging agents into biomarker-informed clinical\ntrials for children with high risk solid tumors.

project	1U01CA263969-01	U01CA263969	10300360	2021	In Vivo Testing of Novel Drug Combinations for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcomas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nDespite the advances made in our understanding of the etiology of pediatric soft tissue sarcomas\n(STS), the overall survival of those diseases has not significantly improved in over 2 decades. For\nchildren with recurrent disease, survival is below 30%, and long-term survivors have an increased\nburden of disease associated with the curative therapies they received. Therefore, the goal of our\nresearch team is to improve the survival and quality of life of children with STS by integrating basic,\ntranslational, and clinical research. For the past 10 years, we have consented STS and other solid\ntumor patients to donate tissue for orthotopic implantation into immunocompromised mice to develop\northotopic patient derived xenografts (O-PDXs). Our O-PDXs have been used for ex vivo high-\nthroughput drug screening and in vivo testing using a standardized preclinical phase I, II, III paradigm.\nRhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common STS in children and genomic studies have shown that\nrare subsets of clonally related cells can survive treatment and contribute to disease recurrence.\nSubsequent integrated analyses using transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic data showed that RMS\ntumors retain lineage-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of their developmental origins.\nMore recently, single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) and in vivo lineage-tracing\nshowed that clones of cells can transition through their normal developmental programs. Indeed, single-\ncell ATAC-seq demonstrated that the cell- and developmental stage–specific super-enhancer activity is\ncorrelated with those clonal changes in gene expression. Chemotherapy eliminates the most\nproliferative tumor cell populations, and the surviving dormant tumor cells rapidly expand and re-\nestablish their developmental hierarchy, which leads to disease recurrence. This is a striking example\nof the complex cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic signaling within STS and the intricate connection between\ndevelopmental and oncogenic pathways in childhood cancer. In this proposal, we will perform in vivo\ntesting for 8-10 drugs per year using our STS O-PDX models. The most compelling pathways are\ndevelopmental kinase pathways (Aim 1), cell stress pathways (Aim 2) and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints\n(Aim 3). Novel drug combinations will be tested as well as those that include conventional\nchemotherapy for standard of care. Particular emphasis will be placed on eliminating all the clones in\nthe tumor to improve survival by reducing disease recurrence.

Consequently, the number of patients that can be enrolled in phase I/II clinical trials is small, and most\npatients will have been extensively treated, hence drug/radiation resistant. Thus, preclinical studies that\naccurately translate into effective clinical therapy are an essential component of pediatric drug development. Our\ngroup has contributed to studies in the PPTP/C that have led to clinical studies through Children's Oncology\nGroup (COG). Of importance, we have developed and characterized over 330 Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX),\ndeveloped from tumors both at diagnosis and relapse, that can be used to facilitate pediatric drug development\nas directed by FDA under the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity for Children Act (RACE for Children\nAct). Based on our studies, both in and outside the PPTC, we propose to use PDX/CDX models of sarcoma,\nkidney cancer, and hepatoblastoma derived from high-risk patients to identify novel agents and combinations,\nand to test at least 8-10 agents per year, for which we have expertise. We will explore specific hypotheses to\nintegrate molecular-targeted agents with conventional chemo-radiation treatment, advanced drug delivery\nsystems (antibody-drug conjugates, nanoparticles), and the use of Single Mouse Testing (SMT) as the primary\nscreening approach. In collaborative studies, we will evaluate a new humanized mouse model where testing of\nimmuno-oncology agents is a priority to treat these PDX models. One of the objective limitations of PPTP/C\ntesting was that relatively few tumor models representing a specific disease (n=3-8/disease) could be used within\nthe resource constraints, a number clearly insufficient to recapitulate the genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity of\neach clinical disease. Our retrospective analysis of PPTP data, and recent prospective testing in the PPTC,\nshows that a single mouse/tumor line gives essentially similar data to conventional testing' (using 10 mice/group\nfor each tumor line). The advantage of the SMT design is that it allows for incorporation of up to 20-fold more\nmodels, more accurately representing the genetic/epigenetic diversity of each pediatric cancer within the same\nresource constraints. The proposed studies will adopt SMT as the primary screening approach to identify agents\nthat have biologically meaningful activity (i.e. large antitumor effects) and identify tumors that are `exceptional\nresponders' for validation. The SMT approach, when linked to the molecular characterization of PDX models,\npotentially increases the power to identify biomarkers associated with response. Using SMT we can essentially\nconduct preclinical phase II trials and simulate the likely clinical response rate more accurately for a given\ndisease. As part of the Ped-In Vivo-TP, we aim to develop highly effective, less toxic therapies for high-risk\ncancers that afflict children and adolescents/young adults (AYA).

To coordinate the activities of the new Ped-In Vivo-TP initiative, we have assembled a team of\ninvestigators from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and Seven Bridges Genomics (SB) with unique combined\nexpertise and experience with in vivo cancer models, scalable cloud-based data management and analysis\nsystems, informatics resource development, and multi-site project coordination. Combining the complementary\nstrengths of JAX and SB provides the ideal foundation for a coordinating center to maximize the short- and\nlong-term impacts of the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program for advancing the application of precision medicine\nin pediatric oncology. We will manage a comprehensive and cohesive testing program to advance precision\nmedicine in pediatric oncology through effective public-private partnerships among pharmaceutical companies,\nregulatory agencies, funders, and research organizations. We will achieve this goal through the following aims:\nAim 1: Establish and maintain the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Coordinating Center (PIVOT CC) to provide\nadministrative and logistical support for diverse stakeholders in the Pediatric in Vivo Testing Program\nconsortium. We will draw on our team's combined decades of experience with multi-site program\nmanagement, cancer model development, standardized testing of in vivo cancer models, data management\nand analysis, and informatics resource development to ensure timely decision making, conformance to\nstandard protocols, resource tracking, and effective communications within the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Aim 2:\nProvide data management, statistical, and bioinformatics support to ensure data security and integrity.\nWe will leverage existing protocols and software systems at JAX and SB to identify relevant in vivo cancer\nmodels and to collect, analyze, and securely manage data generated from testing centers within the\nconsortium. We will perform statistical and bioinformatic analyses on consortium data to reliably inform the\nevaluation of the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in a pediatric oncology setting. We will develop a public-\nfacing data portal for sharing of data and methods with the broader scientific community. Aim 3: Provide\nscientific coordination to maintain an efficient and effective preclinical testing pipeline. We will draw\nfrom the extensive experience of our team with in vivo pharmacology and coordination of similar consortia to\nmanage and coordinate the testing of agents by the Ped-In Vivo-TP centers at all stages of the process, from\nthe identification of relevant in vivo models to the generation of final technical reports and publication of results.\nWe will develop, record, and track performance metrics for the consortium to inform the evaluation of the\nprogram's success and impact.

The primary objective of this two-year program is to train physician-scientists capable\nof providing a critical bridge between the biological sciences and experimental therapeutics. In order to\nachieve this objective, the training program emphasizes a didactic curriculum in clinical research\nmethodology, mentor-supervised clinical and basic science research experiences, and ongoing Scholar\nmonitoring and feedback. All Scholars are assigned a clinical trial project during the course of the training\nprogram. All 40 clinical and laboratory mentors participating in this training program have extensive\nexperience in neuro-oncology research and training, active research funding, and provide an excellent\nresource for Scholars interested in translational research. All Scholars have access to dedicated biostatistical\nand computing support on all projects. An Internal Advisory Committee, as well as an External Advisory\nCommittee, oversee the training program. There is no significant overlap between our unique grant focused\non nervous system tumors and other training grants at Harvard focused on medical oncology. Candidates\ninclude physicians completing clinical training in adult and pediatric neuro-oncology, adult and pediatric\nneurosurgical oncology, adult and pediatric medical oncology and radiation oncology. A qualified pool of\napplicants from these disciplines can be expected to grow from existing and developing sources.

project	2U01CA199000-06	U01CA199000	10296642	2021	NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program - Leukemia	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nThis application seeks renewal of funding for a Research Program for acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n(ALL) in vivo testing as part of the NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP). Recent US\nGovernment legislation, combined with the relative rarity and higher cure rates of childhood cancer\ncompared with adults, emphasize the importance of new agent preclinical testing programs aimed at\nmaximizing the likelihood that only the most active drugs will be advanced into early phase clinical trials.\nThe broad aim of this application is to improve the treatment options for children with aggressive and/or\ndrug resistant ALL by prioritizing new drugs for clinical trials in the disease using state-of-the-art\npreclinical experimental models. This aim will be accomplished using a large panel of 90 pediatric ALL\npatient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that have undergone a high level of cell and molecular\ncharacterization and authentication.\n The PDXs to be used in this study were all established as models of orthotopic disease in immune-\ndeficient (NOD/SCID or NSG) mice from direct patient explants without prior ex vivo culture. The PDXs\ndevelop as systemic disease in NSG mice and infiltrate the same major organs in mice as the primary\ndisease in human patients. Engraftment and responses to treatment are monitored by measuring the\nproportion of human leukemia cells in the peripheral blood of mice on a weekly basis, which provides a\nreliable representation of overall leukemia burden in the animals. Where luciferase-expressing PDXs\nare available, this testing will be augmented by bioluminescence imaging of animals.\n The broad methodology will involve inoculation of PDX cells into NSG mice, a lag time to allow the\ndisease to establish, followed by drug treatment and monitoring to assess drug responses. Methods of\nresponse evaluation have been developed using stringent criteria modeled after the clinical setting, in\norder to minimize the likelihood of over-predicting drug responses in mice leading to failure of drugs in\nthe clinic. The proposed drug testing will adopt multiple formats, including conventional drug testing (6-\n10 mice/group), single-mouse trial testing (1 PDX x 1 mouse x 1 drug) and testing of new agents in\ncombination with standard-of-care drugs. In this fashion, this Research Program aims to test 8-10 new\nagents per year.\n By completing the major objectives outlined in this proposal, the long term health benefit aims to\nimprove the treatment options and quality of life for children with aggressive forms of ALL who would\notherwise succumb to their disease.

project	2U01CA199221-07	U01CA199221	10299853	2021	Genomically informed agent selection and testing in osteosarcoma patient-derived xenograft models	Grant	Project Summary/ Abstract\nSurvival outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma have not changed since the advent of modern chemotherapy\nfour decades ago and it has been challenging to develop new effective therapies in this disease. Our lab’s long-\nterm mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic\nprofiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying\nand/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust\nprofiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft\n(PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new\nagents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it.\nAll of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully\nachieve our goals.\nOur overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in\nosteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in\nrational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s\nOncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets\nidentified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and\ntest agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts\nand patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy\ndata of single agents.\nAgents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being\npresent in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts\nof low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with\ntarget expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model\nwill be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30\nmice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be\nmeasured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response,\nmaintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination\nstudies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two\nsurface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and\n3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent. Our results will guide the development of\nthe next generation of clinical trials in osteosarcoma.

project	2U01CA199288-06	U01CA199288	10300370	2021	In vivo Drug Testing of Pediatric CNS Tumors Using Patient Derived Orthotopic Xenograft Models	Grant	This application is prepared in response to the funding opportunity: NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program\n(U01), RFA-CA-20-034 to renew our existing PPTC UO1 grant. Specifically, we propose to continue the in vivo\ntesting program for central nervous system (CNS) tumors using our panel of patient derived orthotopic xenograft\n(PDOX) models. Brain tumor is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges\nin clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in\ncancer patients. However, efforts in identifying new anti-cancer agents for that are most likely to be effective\nin the clinic have been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly\naccurate model system. Fortunately, we have established a panel of 150 PDOX models of pediatric brain\ntumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models\nare shown to have replicated the histopathology and major genetic abnormalities of the original patient\ntumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. They not only represent different\nclinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly\nidentified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors. The xenograft tumor cells can also\nbe cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined\nwith our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for\nus to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of\nthis unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms\nof action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our\nhypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the\ncorresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have\nbetter chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo\nassays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear\nthe therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular\ncharacterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to\ndetermine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs\nin multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular\nmechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel\npanel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS\ntumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely\npositioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo. Our findings should provide strong preclinical\nevidence to support the initiation of clinical trials.

Grant	PBTC Project Summary/Abstract\nThe primary goal of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) is to rapidly and effectively\ncontribute to the understanding and cure of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors\nthrough innovative, multidisciplinary and multi-institutional prospective clinical trials. PBTC clinical\ntrial development is not only based upon known prognostic factors but also upon an evolving\nunderstanding of pediatric brain tumor biology. The PBTC will continue to utilize innovative study\ndesigns and analyses based on state-of-the-art statistical science. Novel clinical trials will\nincorporate relevant correlative pharmacology, biology, neuroimaging, immunologic and\ngenomics studies in an effort to define and integrate these modalities into a better understanding\nof pediatric CNS tumors. These goals will be accomplished through a close and continued\npartnership with the member institutions' basic and translational scientists as well as the clinical\ntrial experts. In addition, the PBTC welcomes partnerships with investigators outside the\nconsortium providing scientific, laboratory and regulatory support for innovative and high priority\nclinical trials. The PBTC will continue to maintain and grow its relationship with the National\nCancer Institute (NCI) and its large network of adult and pediatric groups as well as with\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. One of the most important goals of the PBTC is to\nsuccessfully complete focused phase I and II clinical trials of novel agents and treatment\napproaches that can be then be translated into large prospective phase II and III studies overseen\nby the Children's Oncology Group (COG). The overarching long-term goal is to improve survival\noutcome and quality of life for children with CNS tumor diagnoses that so often lead to high\nmorbidity and mortality such as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, high-grade gliomas, infant\nembryonal tumors, refractory medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and low-grade gliomas. To this\nend, the PBTC will continue to focus upon introducing novel molecularly-targeted agents via\ninnovative trials to assess the presence of the target in tumor and surrogate tissue, evaluate the\nability of the agent to down-regulate its signaling target and better correlate pharmacokinetic and\npharmacodynamic endpoints with toxicities and clinical responses. The PBTC will also continue\nto explore therapeutic opportunities for pediatric brain tumors through immunotherapeutic\ninterventions as well as via local delivery of treatments. By focusing on the most common solid\ntumor in children which also accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths in\npediatrics, the PBTC will continue to support the NCI's mission of helping all people live longer,\nhealthier lives through its contributions to cancer research and identification of better treatments.

project	3R21CA242861-02S1	R21CA242861	10260680	2020	A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nCancer genomes typically harbor a substantial number of somatic mutations. Relatively few driver mutations\nactually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally\nneutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on\ncoding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The\ncontribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and\ncurrent mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due\nto biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole-\ngenome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new\nmutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions.\nRecently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based\non the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require\nprior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that\ngeneralizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver\nmutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For\nthis purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding\nand noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions.\nSpecifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the\nbackground mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition\nof the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical\ncomponents by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance\np-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This\nstrategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions.\nWe will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby\nderiving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate\nwhether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression\nlevels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have\ndeveloped and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding\nregions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods\ndeveloped and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform.

Since each colon cancer has its own unique features,\nit is very important to obtain personalized cancer treatments and ﬁnd a way to tailor treatment strategies for\neach patient based on each individual's characteristics, including race, gender, genetic factors, immune response\nvariations.\n Recently, Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP) has been commonly used to discover, validate,\nand test drugs. QSP models are a system of differential equations that model the dynamic interactions between\ndrug(s) and a biological system. These mathematical models provide an integrated “systems level” approach to\ndetermining mechanisms of action of drugs and ﬁnding new ways to alter complex cellular networks with mono\nor combination therapy to obtain effective treatments. Since QSP models are a complex system of nonlinear\nequations with many unknown parameters, estimating the values of the model's parameters is extremely difﬁcult.\nExisting parameter estimation methods for QSP models often use assembled data from various sources rather\nthan a single curated dataset. These datasets are usually obtained through various biological experiments, in\nvitro and in vivo animal studies, thus rendering QSP models hard to be practicable for personalized treatments.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no QSP model has been developed for personalized colon cancer treatments.\n In this project, we propose a unique approach to develop a data-driven QSP software to suggest effective\ntreatment for each patient based on gene expression data from the primary tumor samples. Since signatures of\nmain characteristics of tumors, such as immune response variations, can be found in gene expression proﬁling\nof primary tumors, we use gene expression data as input. We develop an innovative framework to systematically\nemploy a combination of data science, mathematical, and statistical methods to obtain personalized colon cancer\ntreatment. We employ novel inverse problem techniques to estimate the values of parameters of the model and\nstatistical methods to perform sensitivity analysis. We will use these techniques to propose an optimal treatment\nstrategy for each patient and predict the efﬁcacy of the proposed treatment. The model might also suggest\nalternative therapies in case of low efﬁcacy for some patients.

However, some clinical trials are excluded\nfrom mandatory reporting to the NCI Data Archive, including phase 1 or 2 studies and older\nphase 3 studies with primary publication dates prior to 2015. Some of these datasets may be\nuseful for secondary analyses by other investigators if patient-level data were made available\npublicly. For example, a well annotated clinical trial dataset from phase 1 or 2 studies could be\nused as an external control for the purpose of FDA approval of an agent evaluated in a single arm\nstudy without a concurrent control arm. Another example is the pooling of outcome data for an\nuncommon tumor histology from multiple phase 2 studies to guide the design of a future study.\nTo increase the number of study datasets that are available for public use, COG is requesting an\nadministrative supplement to fund the generation of selected legacy clinical trial datasets.

The resource includes\ncomprehensive annotation of treatment exposure, ongoing longitudinal follow-up and an established\nbiorepository, from which genotyping (SNP array) and sequencing (whole exome) of almost 6,000 survivors will\nbe available for investigators for identification of genetic susceptibility for disease- and treatment-induced late\neffects. Extensive use by the research community has resulted in: 264 published or in press manuscripts now\ncited over 12,600 times; 229 presented abstracts; 42 investigator-initiated grants, totaling $37.1 million in\nfunding; utilization by a diverse group of 673 investigators; training of 63 young investigators; conduct of six\nrandomized trials; increased knowledge to inform exposure-based clinical care guidelines; and a highly\nsuccessful model for multiple national and international collaborative initiatives of pediatric cancer survivorship\nresearch. During the next five years, activities will focus on maintaining, enhancing and promoting use of this\nsingular resource. The overarching goal of the CCSS resource is to increase the conduct of innovative and high\nimpact research related to pediatric cancer survivorship.

project	3U24CA209999-05S1	U24CA209999	10227337	2020	Adapting Functional Precision Oncology for pediatric brain cancer	Grant	ABSTRACT\nCancers are typically composed of heterogeneous populations of tumors cells characterized by mutations that\ndistinguish each cell subpopulation from one another. The parent grant leverages DNA sequencing and a suite\nof important new analytical algorithms and visualization tools to identify mutations in cancer patients and track\nthe evolution of a patient’s tumor over the course of treatment. The tools we have developed, or are in the\nprocess of developing, form the foundation of a functional precision oncology approach we are implementing at\nthe University of Utah with a combination of set-aside funding from the parent project, and institutional funding.\nThe current Supplemental Request will adapt the tools funded by the parent project for effective use in pediatric\ncancers. The main objective of this Supplemental Proposal is to adapt our functional precision oncology\napproach to inform treatment selection in children with brain tumors, a patient cohort that experiences extremely\ndire prognoses in which rational treatment choice is difficult without precision guidance. There are compelling\nreasons to believe, however, that such adaptation will require algorithmic modifications. This is because key\naspects of our approach rely on genomic mutations in the tumor, but previous studies show that pediatric tumors\nhave a substantially lower mutation load than adult cancers. Therefore it is necessary to expand our functional\napproach in pediatric cases, and adapt them to lower mutation loads in pediatric tumors. To accomplish such\nadaptation, we will, first, perform functional drug screening and genomic/transcriptomic characterization in two\npediatric brain cancer index patients, so we have appropriate test cases drivin our tool development and testing.\nWe will then, second, analyze the pediatric brain tumor index patient datasets, and adapt our functional precision\ninformatics methods for use in pediatric brain tumors with expected lower genomic mutation loads. We foresee\ntwo specific areas of development: because of the substantially lower number of mutations in the pediatric cases,\nwe will integrate the ability to simultaneously analyze somatic copy number variation (CNV) mutations, together\nwith somatic point mutations to (1) reconstruct the genomic subclones that make up the tumor; and (2) to carry\nout cell assignment to the genomically defined sublones from single-cell RNA sequencing data used to study\ntumor subclone-specific gene expression behavior. We have already shown that CNVs can be used both for\ntumor subclone reconstruction and cell assignment, and anticipate that by integrating CNV and point mutation-\nbased analyses in a single tool will allow functional precision analysis of pediatric cancer patients at, or close to,\nthe level achievable for adult patients.\n1	Adult;Algorithmic Software;Algorithms;Area;Behavior;Brain Neoplasms;Cancer Patient;Cells;Child;Childhood;Childhood Brain Neoplasm;Childhood Malignant Brain Tumor;Copy Number Polymorphism;DNA sequencing;Data;Data Set;Development;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Drug Screening;Evolution;Foundations;Funding;Gene Expression;Genomics;Informatics;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Modification;Mutation;Patients;Pediatric Neoplasm;Point Mutation;Population Heterogeneity;Process;Selection for Treatments;Testing;Universities;Utah;Visualization software;base;cohort;computerized tools;experience;indexing;neoplastic cell;parent grant;parent project;precision oncology;reconstruction;single-cell RNA sequencing;tool;tool development;transcriptomics;treatment choice;tumor;tumor heterogeneity	UNIVERSITY OF UTAH	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	UNITED STATES	Gabor T Marth,Aaron R Quinlan	DCB	Jerry  Li	152418	<$250k	152418	14-Sep-2020	1-Sep-2016	31-Aug-2022	PA-18-591	CCDI

This exercise is uniquely challenging for pediatric cancers.\nEven compared to other cancers, childhood cancers are highly heterogeneous, often involving genes not\ntypically attributed to adult cancers and often involving complex, large-scale variations. Childhood cancers also\ntend to arise in less differentiated cell lineages, progress rapidly, and have much lower incidence and mutation\nburden. These characteristics are compounded by unique clinical challenges related to developmental factors\nand treatment-related secondary cancers, resulting in significantly fewer targeted therapy options available to\npediatric patients. These challenges have led to a significant under-representation of genes and variants\nrelevant to childhood cancers in public cancer databases and knowledgebases. Thus, there is a critical unmet\nneed for structured genetic variant level data in publicly accessible databases which document diagnostic,\nprognostic and therapeutic biomarkers for childhood cancers. The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI)\nfocuses on accelerating research on childhood cancers by developing and enhancing tools and methods to\nextract knowledge and enable sharing of childhood cancer data. The CIViC resource is a knowledge extraction\nand data sharing platform for clinical interpretation of cancer variants. Expert curators extract knowledge and\nevidence from the literature to produce rigorous and high-quality assertions following widely-recognized clinical\nvariant classification guidelines. The variant classifications are made freely available in the public domain and\nare widely utilized in clinical workflows. However, to date, CIViC knowledge curation has focused almost\nentirely on adult malignancies. Other key variant knowledgebases either do not provide clinical relevance, lack\nchildhood-specific interpretations, and/or have restrictive licenses. We propose to close this knowledge gap in\nCIViC by forging new and expanded collaboration with pediatric cancer experts, and building domain-specific\ntools for curation and dissemination of high-quality variant interpretations for childhood cancers. The CIViC\nvisual interface will be adapted to better support curation and dissemination of childhood cancer variants\ninterpretations. A modification of our existing natural language processing approach will be used to prioritize\nliterature relevant to childhood cancers and an expert panel will prioritize childhood variants and subsequently\nperform and also evaluate curation on taskforce calls. Based on the experience and products of this work, we\nwill develop childhood-cancer-specific curation guidelines and conduct pilot development of a childhood cancer\nvariant panel that is capable of evolving rapidly as childhood cancer variant knowledge accumulates in CIViC.

Key elements for success will be the provision of high quality genome sequence\ndata on well-phenotyped patients and their families; the collection and accessibility of data to\nthe research community in an intuitive manner; and the integration of genetic data with\nphenotypic information in the context of this program and comparison to other large data\nresources. We propose to continue as a Kids First Sequencing Center at the Broad Institute as\nwe have done for the past five years for the program and as we have also done in support of\nother large flagship NIH genome projects. Our center brings the domain expertise in high\nthroughput data generation, processing and analysis, and disease gene discovery required to\nmeet the objectives of the Kids First Program. We will apply deep, high-quality whole genome\nsequencing and RNA sequencing data on selected samples. We will be flexible to work closely\nand accommodate the needs and interests of selected X01 Investigators. We will participate in\nthe evaluation of these data types and their overall impact on discovery and scientific output of\nthe program. A key feature of our center is our implementation of a robust analytical framework\nfor variant assessment and disease gene discovery, which builds on Broad investigators’ world-\nleading roles in statistical genetics, functional annotation, and clinical variant interpretation as\nwell as access to exome and genome data from hundreds of thousands of samples sequenced\nat Broad. This has enabled us to build a systematic pipeline for gene discovery that will be\nmade freely available to the Kids First program. With data produced and processed in a\nconsistent way, we can offer seamless integration of Kids First data into our analytic framework.\nFor many of the diseases targeted by the pediatric research community, confident discovery of\ncausal genes will require aggregation of cases across centers around the world. We will partner\nwith the Kids First Data Resource Center in a variety of ways to ensure that the program is well-\naligned with other large-scale resource generation projects. With this we hope to support Kids\nFirst as a whole and establish standards for data sharing in clinical genomics, accelerating\ncollaboration and facilitating robust disease gene discovery.

EA\nis a vibrant member of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and the NCI Community Oncology\nResearch Program (NCORP), focused on practice-changing clinical and translational research across\nthe cancer care continuum from prevention and early detection, through the management of advanced\ndisease and its impact. As an NCORP Research Base, EA has engaged community providers and\nresearchers to develop a robust research portfolio that spans Cancer Prevention, Cancer Control, and\nCancer Care Delivery, aligned with the overall scientific themes of precision oncology, immuno-oncology,\nreducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and leveraging novel biomarker platforms. Cancer control\ntrials examine and intervene on challenges associated with cancer and treatment-related symptoms and\nconcerns. EA's portfolio of therapeutic trials yield opportunities to apply patient-reported outcomes\nmeasurement science to quantify health-related quality of life, symptoms, and domains most relevant to\npatients in the context of evolving treatment paradigms. Behavioral and biomarker-driven symptom\ninterventions aim to improve quality of life and cancer survivorship. Cardiotoxicity research aims to\nmitigate risk through quantifying cardiotoxicity associated with treatment, identifying groups at risk, and\nadvancing interventions to reduce risk. Prevention trials embrace the NCI's broad definition of prevention\nto include primary prevention, cancer screening, and secondary prevention and aim to identify high risk\ngroups for precision prevention strategies. Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) examines the\ncomplex interactions between patient, provider, and system factors that influence care, and adapts and\nevaluates interventions in heterogenous community oncology practices. Health equity research\npermeates EA science through embedding disparities-related research questions that span EA activities,\nadopting a broad view of underserved populations including adolescents and young adults, the elderly,\nracial and ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities and rural residents. Key collaborations with\ncommunity-based oncology programs will ensure access to EA NCTN and NCORP trials in communities\nwhere patients receive their care. EA provides access to existing NCI-funded resources and a network\nof >10000 physicians, scientists, nurses, research associates (RAs), statisticians, biomedical information\ntechnologists, and patient advocates across approximately 600 institutions and organizations. EA has\nprovided scientific leadership in the NCORP community through advancing rigorous, practice-changing\nclinical trials and translational research in cancer control, prevention and care delivery and is well poised\nto continue to support the NCI's mission to engage community-based diverse populations in cancer\nresearch.

The overall 5-year survival rate for childhood cancers,\nmany of which were uniformly fatal in the pre-chemotherapy era, is now 84%. Progress for a number of childhood\ncancers, however, has been limited, with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50%\nof children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing\nto their disease. In the US, cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease in children greater than one\nyear of age. Moreover, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage,\nhormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the\nestimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health related quality of life\ncomplication from childhood cancer and its treatment. Thus, despite our advances, development of new\ntherapeutic approaches must be a priority for childhood cancer basic, translational and clinical researchers. The\nChildren’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and\nadolescent cancer research, was founded 17 years ago. The COG’s multidisciplinary research team, comprised\nof more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and\ncancer centers. This proposal is for COG, as part of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) National Clinical Trials\nNetwork (NCTN), to continue its collaborative research work that supports the mission of improving the outcome\nfor all children with cancer. The COG will design and conduct clinical-translational studies for children with cancer\nthat builds on an increasing understanding of the molecular basis for pediatric malignancies and has the highest\npotential to improve the outcome. Using innovative clinical trial designs suitable for the study of rare diseases,\nwe will study novel therapeutic approaches including but not limited to targeted small molecule drugs,\nimmunotherapies and cellular therapies. The COG research portfolio importantly also includes clinical trials\nfocused on improving the quality of life children with cancer and survivors. As more than 90% of children\ndiagnosed with cancer in the US are treated at COG member institutions, the COG has the ability to offer a\ndiverse population of children with cancer and their families the opportunity to participate in innovative research.\nThis research effort includes allowing for collection and annotation of biospecimens from all children with cancer,\nproviding the foundation for discovery and accelerating the most promising research efforts conducted in\nlaboratories around the world. The proposal is for support of the COG Network Statistics and Data Management\nCenter which collaborates with COG scientific leaders to design, conduct, analyze and report the results of\nclinical-translational trials for the treatment of childhood cancers.	1 year old;Acute;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Adolescent;Advanced Development;Australia;Biology;Brain Stem Glioma;Canada;Cancer Center;Cancer Patient;Cancer Survivor;Caring;Cause of Death;Cell Therapy;Child;Child Support;Childhood;Childhood Cancer Treatment;Childhood Leukemia;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Cooperative Group;Clinical Trials Design;Collaborations;Collection;Communities;Companions;Complication;Country;Data;Diagnosis;Disease;Ensure;Family;Foundations;Functional disorder;Generations;Genomics;Goals;Hormonal;Immunotherapy;Industry;Infrastructure;Institution;Interdisciplinary Study;Knowledge;Laboratories;Late Effects;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Mission;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;National Cancer Institute;National Clinical Trials Network;Neuroblastoma;New Zealand;Organ;Outcome;Patients;Pediatric Hospitals;Pediatric Oncology Group;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population Heterogeneity;Population Research;Prognosis;Quality of life;Rare Diseases;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Science;Second Primary Cancers;Survival Rate;Survivors;Time;Tissues;Translational Research;United States;Universities;Work;anticancer research;base;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;childhood cancer survivor;data centers;data management;data sharing;density;design;experience;functional outcomes;health related quality of life;high risk;improved;improved outcome;innovation;member;mortality;multidisciplinary;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;organizational structure;programs;reproductive;small molecule;statistics;survivorship;translational clinical trial;translational scientist;translational study;trial design	PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE	OAKLAND	CA	UNITED STATES	TODD A ALONZO	DCTD	Margaret M Mooney	10077753	>=$1M	10077753	3-Mar-2021	15-Apr-2014	28-Feb-2025	RFA-CA-17-057	CCDI

Over 90% of United States and Canadian children and adolescents with cancer are\ntreated at COG institutions with no racial, ethnic or geographic bias to registration, allowing for near-\npopulation-based clinical, translational and basic research. COG has established a strong track record of\ncollecting and banking tumor and non-diseased biospecimens from patients enrolled in COG-sponsored\nclinical trials, most of which include randomized treatment questions. The COG Biospecimen Bank (COG\nBiobank), located within the Biopathology Center (part of the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at\nNationwide Children’s Hospital), aims to provide high-quality pediatric and adolescent human malignant\nbiospecimens to the research community. Upon review and approval, biospecimens are prioritized for\ndistribution to the COG investigators defined in the clinical trial protocols. After the needs of the planned\nresearch have been addressed, residual (legacy) banked biospecimens can be distributed to other\ninvestigators within and outside COG via the NCTN Navigator The COG Group and Biobank Concierges\ncan also facilitate access to COG legacy biospecimens that are not currently uploaded in Navigator. For\nall biospecimen distribution projects, a feasibility assessment by the COG Biobank and the COG\nStatistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) is completed prior to proposal submission. This\nproposal supports the collection, processing, and distribution of biospecimens from patient enrolled on\nCOG-sponsored trials. The Pediatric Division of the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) then\nfacilitates the distribution of the approved legacy biospecimens.\nThe COG Biobank seeks to directly promote and support outstanding research in the diagnosis and\ntreatment of pediatric cancer through centralized collection, quality control, storage, and distribution\nprocedures. The COG Biobank will continue efforts to provide the latest biorepository-based\ntechnological innovations and best practices, resulting in constant improvements in our operational\ncapabilities, investigator access to biospecimens, investigator satisfaction, and the stewardship of these\nprecious resources. Under proper regulatory guidelines and in association with the COG SDMC, the\nCOG Biobank will support translational aspects of cutting-edge research by ensuring appropriate tracking\nof biospecimens as well as linkage to existing demographic, clinical, biological, treatment, and outcome\ndata. Finally, the COG Biobank will provide investigators with a comprehensive database solution and\ndynamic informatics tools that facilitate pediatric cancer research. The COG Biobank also plans to\nsupport the processing, banking, and distribution of biospecimens to the Cancer Immune Monitoring and\nAnalysis Centers (CIMACs).

Grant	PBTC Project Summary/Abstract\nThe primary goal of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) is to rapidly and effectively\ncontribute to the understanding and cure of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors\nthrough innovative, multidisciplinary and multi-institutional prospective clinical trials. PBTC clinical\ntrial development is not only based upon known prognostic factors but also upon an evolving\nunderstanding of pediatric brain tumor biology. The PBTC will continue to utilize innovative study\ndesigns and analyses based on state-of-the-art statistical science. Novel clinical trials will\nincorporate relevant correlative pharmacology, biology, neuroimaging, immunologic and\ngenomics studies in an effort to define and integrate these modalities into a better understanding\nof pediatric CNS tumors. These goals will be accomplished through a close and continued\npartnership with the member institutions' basic and translational scientists as well as the clinical\ntrial experts. In addition, the PBTC welcomes partnerships with investigators outside the\nconsortium providing scientific, laboratory and regulatory support for innovative and high priority\nclinical trials. The PBTC will continue to maintain and grow its relationship with the National\nCancer Institute (NCI) and its large network of adult and pediatric groups as well as with\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. One of the most important goals of the PBTC is to\nsuccessfully complete focused phase I and II clinical trials of novel agents and treatment\napproaches that can be then be translated into large prospective phase II and III studies overseen\nby the Children's Oncology Group (COG). The overarching long-term goal is to improve survival\noutcome and quality of life for children with CNS tumor diagnoses that so often lead to high\nmorbidity and mortality such as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, high-grade gliomas, infant\nembryonal tumors, refractory medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and low-grade gliomas. To this\nend, the PBTC will continue to focus upon introducing novel molecularly-targeted agents via\ninnovative trials to assess the presence of the target in tumor and surrogate tissue, evaluate the\nability of the agent to down-regulate its signaling target and better correlate pharmacokinetic and\npharmacodynamic endpoints with toxicities and clinical responses. The PBTC will also continue\nto explore therapeutic opportunities for pediatric brain tumors through immunotherapeutic\ninterventions as well as via local delivery of treatments. By focusing on the most common solid\ntumor in children which also accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths in\npediatrics, the PBTC will continue to support the NCI's mission of helping all people live longer,\nhealthier lives through its contributions to cancer research and identification of better treatments.

project	5UM1CA228823-03	UM1CA228823	9983644	2020	Children's Oncology Group Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trial Network	Grant	The mission of the Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trials Network (PEP-CTN) is to identify and\ndevelop effective new agents for children and adolescents with cancer, through rational and\nefficient clinical and laboratory research. PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative\ngenomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the\ndisposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer.\nAnnually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto\nclinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core premier pediatric oncology sites throughout\nthe country. The network institutions are selected through a peer review process, and serve as\na national and international model for new agent development in pediatric oncology. The PEP-\nCTN will leverage the database infrastructure and resources of the parent Children's Oncology\nGroup while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure to ensure rapid\ndevelopment, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical trials.\nThe PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology,\npharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems\nto facilitate the transfer of response and correlative imaging studies for central review and\nanalyses.\nThe PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer\nagents into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To\nexpeditiously obtain preliminary efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and\npilot studies in order to inform tumor specific trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To\nperform genomic analyses, including single gene studies or gene panels, to identify appropriate\npatients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor\ncharacteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole exome\nsequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints,\nincluding circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities,\ninto early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect\non tumors.. Development of targeted therapy for childhood cancer is a high priority as it offers the\nprospect of more efficacious and less toxic therapeutics.

project	1P01CA210944-01	P01CA210944	9208826	2017	Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy	Grant	The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology\nand to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation\ntherapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4\nimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory\neffects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across\nmultiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and\nanimal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of\nprojects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on\ntwo clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT\n(HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and\ndurvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast\ncarcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the\nmechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining\ndendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of\nresistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in\nProjects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this\nP01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a\nstate-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to\ndrive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact\nis to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune\ntherapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.

The CAR developed at our center is now in international trials for refractory/relapsed pre-B cell acute\nlymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic\nlymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remain as the major unmet medical need in blood cancers. Our central hypothesis\nis that therapies with combination of CAR T cells and universal CAR T cells created with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic\nediting will enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer. We have\nbrought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and\npublished together for many years. Each disease-focused project will be led by a recognized authority in the\nfield. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which will coordinately closely with essential\nshared resource cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients\non two clinical trials: (i) CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD22 will be used to address the remaining unmet\nmedical need in ALL, which is the emergence of CD19 escape variants; and (ii) universal CAR T cells targeting\nCD19 will be tested in patients with CLL to determine the role of T cell intrinsic resistance to therapy. In AML,\nthe central problem in CAR T cell therapy is the lack of a known surface antigen that is present on AML but\nlacking from normal hematopoiesis. The goal of Project 2 is to open a wide therapeutic window by genetically\nmodifying normal marrow to make it resistant to killing by anti-AML CAR T cells, and delivering potent anti-\nleukemic CAR T cells specific for CD33. In Project 3, the overall hypothesis is that anti-myeloma efficacy will be\nmaximized by (i) combining CART-BCMA and CTL019 to eliminate both the dominant neoplastic PC population\nand rare myeloma-propagating B cells, and (ii) modifying CAR T cells to circumvent specific myeloma-induced\nT-cell-inhibitory mechanisms (i.e., immune checkpoints).\nThe Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of project management for collaboration\nand biostatistics, clinical safety and monitoring, and fiscal support (Core A), a GMP facility for manufacture of\ncells and RNA (Core B), and a state-of-the-art platform for GLP analysis to provide high dimensional data of the\nsamples generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the lessons\nof CAR T for ALL into meaningful efficacy against all hematologic malignancies.

This work is urgently needed\nbecause cancer screening and prevention disparities exist with regard to delivery of evidence-based\ninterventions (EBIs). Effective strategies to improve implementation of EBIs in primary care community health\ncenters (CHCs) that can eliminate these disparities are not known or poorly understood. Implementation\nscience can contribute new knowledge that will transform CHCs' ability to serve the nation's most vulnerable\npopulations. The BRIDGE-C2 Center will: 1) create a sustainable infrastructure for developing, conducting, and\ncontinuously evaluating implementation strategies that enhance primary care's ability to equitably deliver\nevidence-based cancer screening and prevention interventions to all people, emphasizing closing care gaps\nfor vulnerable populations; 2) build capacity and training opportunities, and engage a multi-disciplinary team of\nimplementation science and methods experts, to facilitate the development of innovative approaches relevant\nto our grand challenge; and 3) identify strategies to improve implementation of cancer screening and\nprevention EBIs in primary care, and conduct research / develop pragmatic methods to tailor, enhance, and\nsupport the adoption and sustainability of these strategies. We will build on the strong established partnerships\nbetween researchers at Oregon Health & Science (OHSU) primary care, the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute,\nand the OCHIN Implementation Laboratory (a well-established national network of >500 CHCs that share an\nelectronic health record through the OCHIN Practice-Based Research Network). The BRIDGE-C2 Center will\nconduct pilot studies that develop and test strategies to improve implementation of EBIs, rapidly scale up\nsuccessful pilots to conduct large scale pragmatic trials, and widely disseminate effective innovations to\nprimary care practices caring for underserved populations. Woven throughout these activities will be the\nCenter's focus on mentoring and training early career implementation scientists and leveraging collaborations\nto increase implementation science capacity. The Center's Administrative Core will serve as the nucleus that\nbridges the Research Program and Implementation Laboratory, providing support for research activities,\nleadership, governance, investigator development, dissemination, evaluation, and a connection to the national\nISCCC network. Our first two research pilots aim to improve cervical cancer screening and follow-up care and\ntobacco cessation. Our first two methods pilots will create novel capabilities to predict needed implementation\nsupport based on provider and practice characteristics. We will spread our discoveries and create mechanisms\nfor widely disseminating our findings and innovations to scientific, professional, and community networks to\nincrease implementation of cancer screening and prevention EBIs and decrease health disparities.

project	1P50CA244431-01	P50CA244431	9869208	2019	Washington University Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Component\nBackground and vision. As an Advanced Center, the vision of the Washington University Implementation\nScience Center for Cancer Control (WU-ISCCC) is to conduct implementation research to help eliminate\ncancer disparities in rural and other disadvantaged communities.\nGoal. The overall goal of the WU-ISCCC is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for rapid-cycle\nimplementation research to increase the reach, external validity, and sustainability of effective cancer control\ninterventions. Our goal and Center activities capture three distinct features: (1) a focus on elimination of cancer\ndisparities; (2) the need for rapid-cycle studies; and (3) the use of systems science approaches to enhance\nmethods and outcomes in implementation science.\nSetting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration,\ncatalyzes new ideas, and ensures support for research that finds solutions for complex implementation\nchallenges in real-world settings with high cancer disparities (rural and urban counties in Missouri and Illinois).\nSubstantial matching contributions from Washington University will allow us to strategically invest in new ideas.\nAims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) advance the field of implementation science in cancer control\nby conducting innovative and impactful research; (2) expand an exceptional, diverse team of implementation\nscience investigators and stakeholders; (3) organize and integrate Center components to facilitate\ntransdisciplinary team science; (4) develop an Implementation Laboratory (known as the “Innovation\nIncubator”) to serve as a conduit for innovative, rapid-cycle, and impactful research; and (5) address cancer\ndisparities by making it as easy as possible for disadvantaged populations to encounter, use, and benefit from\nevidence-based interventions.\nInnovations and impact. The WU-ISCCC will be innovative and provide a significant return on the scientific\ninvestment. First, our Center has distinctive features that include a combined focus on cancer disparities, the\napplication of strategies to conduct rapid-cycle studies, and the use of systems science approaches. Second,\nwe have assembled a diverse, world class team with strong linkages to multiple practice settings that will be\ncritical parts of our Innovation Incubator. Third, we will engage investigators from different disciplines and\ninvest in the development of early career scholars as cancer implementation scientists. Fourth, we will\nstrategically and creatively disseminate products in ways that will benefit researchers, practitioners, and\ncommunity members. Fifth, we have developed a focused strategy for collective integration of our projects,\ncores, and units to ensure that the WU-ISCCC impact is greater than the sum of its individual parts.

Optimized\nimplementation occurs when: (1) the strategies employed to implement EBIs address the key barriers to\nimplementation that are active in the specific settings in which implementation occurs, and (2) those strategies\nreflect the best possible methods for addressing the barriers. Despite two decades of progress in implementation\nscience (IS), practical tools and guidance to support optimized EBI implementation are lacking; as a result,\nstrategies are often mismatched to barriers and are often not optimized for effectiveness, efficiency, or fit with local\nresources. The result is suboptimal implementation in the form of lost time, effort, and resources and, ultimately,\npoorer cancer outcomes. The OPTICC Center will advance IS and, in turn, improve EBI implementation in cancer\ncontrol by developing, testing, and refining innovative methods for optimizing EBI implementation. The OPTICC\nCenter is a strategic collaboration of the University of Washington (UW), Kaiser Permanente Washington Health\nResearch Institute (KPWHRI), and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three cores will\nsupport its work. The Administrative Core will promote multidisciplinary collaboration, research excellence, and\nmethodological innovation. It will also lead Center outreach and dissemination efforts, evaluate Center impact, and\ncoordinate Center activities. The Research Program Core will conduct innovative implementation studies, method\nand measurement studies, and small pilot studies that advance the Center’s “grand challenge” IS theme of\noptimizing EBI implementation. A three-stage approach to optimizing EBI implementation will be taken—identify\nand prioritize barriers, match strategies, and test strategies—with measurement development spanning all three\nstages. The Implementation Laboratory Core will establish and coordinate a network of diverse clinical and\ncommunity sites to conduct “in vivo” IS studies, implement cancer control EBIs, and shape the Center’s research\nagenda. The Center’s initial studies will focus on optimizing implementation of screening EBIs for cervical,\ncolorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer. However, the methods for optimizing EBI implementation that the Center\nwill develop, test, and refine can be applied broadly across the cancer care continuum, for a wide range of cancers,\nto answer a wide range of IS questions.

The impact of these strategies on cancer outcomes is\nsignificant for both the general population and low income and under-represented groups that bear a\ndisproportionate share of preventable cancer burden, but evidence-based interventions have not been\nuniformly used across population groups. Gaps in implementation of the evidence base can be seen for nearly\nall known cancer prevention and early detection strategies. As a result, we incur substantial avoidable cancer\nmorbidity and mortality and tolerate preventable inequities.\nThe Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity (ISCCCE) will create an ecosystem for robust\nimplementation science (IS) related to cancer prevention and control in Massachusetts community health\ncenters (CHCs) and their local communities. Our theme, improving community health by integrating health\nequity and implementation science for evidence-based cancer control, reflects our critical mass of expertise in\ncancer disparities, IS, and community-based cancer prevention and control research. Our “grand challenge”\nis to address the inequitable implementation and limited scale of evidence-based interventions by developing\nand testing implementation strategies aimed at narrowing health inequities and by advancing methods that\ncarefully consider the low-resource, complex nature of CHCs where adaptation and cost-effective solutions are\nneeded most. The implementation studies we conduct will address inequities within CHC clinical practice as\nwell as prevention interventions that link to community resources and assets. Our I-Lab is comprised of 31\nCHCs who are members of the Mass League of Community Health Centers and use a common EHR vendor-\nneutral population management system that has extensive reporting capability within and across CHCs, which\nwill allow us to study implementation outcomes in different geographic settings across the state using common\nmeasures. Given that achieving equity in community health requires clinical, community, and policy-level\ninterventions, our pilots will also examine how to expand the impact and sustainability of CHCs’ cancer\nprevention efforts through effective partnerships in community and policy settings. Our Network Unit connects\nus directly with other Moonshot IS initiatives and national community health leadership, and expands\nopportunities for collaboration and synergy, building IS capacity in our own institutions and across the nation.

These models and methods will be used to guide selection and implementation of\nevidence-based programs for cancer prevention and control (CPC). We will initially focus on lung cancer\nscreening in rural primary care settings, first in Colorado and then nationally through collaboration with a well-\nestablished primary care network (i.e., National Research Network).\nOur overarching framework will be our enhanced RE-AIM/PRISM model, which is an extension of the broadly\nused Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework with the addition of\ncontextual factors (e.g., Intervention characteristics, implementation and sustainability infrastructure). It will\nserve as the basis to develop and test innovative assessments of costs, benefits, and value from the\nperspective of different stakeholders to understand and guide implementation. We will meaningfully engage\nwith and include the perspectives of patients, providers, and staff stakeholders in all our studies. Our pilot\nImplementation Study will adapt, implement, and evaluate strategies using stakeholder-engaged approaches\nto value to guide the implementation of shared decision-making and smoking cessation related to lung cancer\nscreening.\nOur Methods Unit will refine and evaluate our pragmatic cost assessment methods to determine\nimplementation/replication costs from the perspective(s) of patients, providers, and delivery staff and then\ndevelop and pilot test brief survey measures of preferences regarding the relative benefit of different RE-AIM\noutcomes. We will then assess relationships among RE-AIM outcomes preferences and selection of different\nCPC programs. Finally, our Outreach and Network Unit will engage in a) outreach activities targeted at junior\nand mid-career investigators and practitioners including online professional development (e.g., graduate\ncertificate program, micro-certification) and tailored mentoring and technical assistance approaches; b)\ndissemination activities to support the packaging and communication of research findings; and c)\ncollaboration activities to facilitate partnerships on CPC and implementation science using multiple channels\nand including development of shared pragmatic D&I measures and data.

Penn offers a unique environment in which\nto conduct this paradigm-shifting work, given our expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics,\nand innovative cancer care delivery. The complementary and multi-disciplinary expertise of the three MPIs (Bei-\ndas, Bekelman, Schnoll), coupled with existing Penn resources, including the Penn Center for Cancer Care\nInnovation [PC3I], the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics [CHIBE], and the Penn Imple-\nmentation Science Center at the Leonard Davis Institute [PISCE@LDI], represent a unique opportunity to ad-\nvance the quality of cancer care. The Administrative Core, led by Drs. Beidas, Bekelman, and Schnoll, will ensure\nthat the activities of Penn ISC3 are coordinated, synergistic, and congruent with timelines. The Implementation\nLaboratory, led by Drs. Bekelman and Shulman, represents a diverse ecosystem that includes five hospitals and\nlinked clinical sites, with over 200 oncologists that serve over 15,000 unique new patients annually. Our Research\nProgram, led by Drs. Beidas and Buttenheim, will oversee the development and testing of implementation strat-\negies that target patients and clinicians within our Implementation Lab and are centered on the idea of ‘nudging’\nfor optimal implementation and effectiveness outcomes. The Research Program includes investigators with ex-\npertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery research, healthcare innovation,\nmeasurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we propose three Signature Pilot Projects and two\nMethods Projects with a commitment to rapid learning that will allow Penn ISC3 to be optimally nimble. Signature\nPilot Project 1 (Jenssen/Leone) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase referral\nto tobacco cessation programs among cancer patients. Signature Pilot Project 2 (Bekelman/Patel) tests patient-\nand clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase higher-value bone modifying agents in patients with\nbreast, lung, and prostate cancer. Common methods and measures are linked to allow for pooling of data and\nto accomplish our objectives of testing multilevel implementation strategies and mechanisms across contexts.\nOur exploratory and high-reward Signature Pilot Project 3 (Bekelman/Rendle) will test a patient-directed imple-\nmentation strategy that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to promote oral chemotherapy ad-\nherence and symptom management. Two methods projects, in support of the Projects, will advance the science\nof implementation methods. Methods Project 1 will develop a toolkit for the application of rapid cycle approaches\n(Asch/Buttenheim); Methods Project 2 will use qualitative comparative analysis to characterize multilevel con-\ntextual variation (Barg/Rendle). The Penn ISC3 has the potential to identify novel, disseminable, and scalable\nways to advance the quality of cancer care and improve the health outcomes for individuals with cancer.\nPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page	Address;African American;American;Artificial Intelligence;Behavior;Cancer Center;Cancer Control;Cancer Patient;Communication;Communities;Coupled;Data Pooling;Development;Economics;Ecosystem;Effectiveness;Ensure;Environment;Event;Evidence based practice;Eye;Female;Foundations;Funding;Future;Goals;Grant;Health;Healthcare;Hospitals;Incentives;Individual;Institutes;International;Knowledge;Laboratories;Learning;Link;Literature;Machine Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Measurement;Measures;Medicaid;Medical;Medicine;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone;Methods;National Cancer Institute;Oncologist;Oral;Outcome;Patients;Pennsylvania;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilot Projects;Psychology;Qualitative Methods;Recommendation;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Science;Scientist;Site;System;Technology;Testing;TimeLine;Tobacco Use Cessation;Tobacco use;Training;Underserved Population;Uninsured;Universities;Variant;behavioral economics;bone;cancer care;care delivery;care outcomes;chemotherapy;clinical research site;comparative;compliance behavior;evidence base;heuristics;high reward;implementation science;implementation strategy;improved;improved outcome;infancy;innovation;insight;lens;malignant breast neoplasm;multidisciplinary;next generation;novel;programs;research to practice;shift work;skeletal;success;symptom management;synergism;tool;treatment as usual;uptake	UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	Rinad Sary Beidas,Justin  Bekelman,Robert A Schnoll	DCCPS	Cynthia  Vinson	983060	$750k to $999k	983060	30-Jul-2020	1-Aug-2020	31-Jul-2025	RFA-CA-19-006	Moonshot

The\nAdministrative Core will manage the Center, ensure that iDAPT is engaged with “real world” clinical partners,\npatients, and families, is well-networked with the Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control\nconsortium, and engage in a comprehensive evaluation of Center activities and milestones. The Research\nProgram will include an Implementation Studies Unit with an initial 2-year pilot study using adaptable\ntechnology to enhance shared decision-making in survivorship care planning for survivors of breast cancer.\nThe Research Program also includes a Methods Unit with an initial innovation pilot study to test the feasibility\nof natural language processing to measure communication patterns pre-implementation and to monitor\nimplementation fidelity of programs designed to enhance within-team and clinical team-to-patient electronic\ncommunication. The Research Program is expected to complete 8 to 10 pilot studies. In order to foster\nresearch aligned with iDAPT’s theme, we will build and sustain iDAPT’s Implementation Laboratory which\nincorporates capacity building and infrastructure for testing the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and\nreal time deployment of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The laboratory\nincludes primary care and oncology clinics in our local “Hubs” in southern Appalachia (North Carolina) and the\nnortheast (Massachusetts) and “Spokes” including over 900 community-based oncology clinics in the NCIs\nNational Community Oncology Research Program and nationwide Veteran’s Administration clinics. iDAPTs\nleadership is a multi-disciplinary team of experts with extensive experience in cancer-focused implementation\nscience, behavioral science, computer engineering and computer science, clinical informatics, formative\nqualitative methods, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The iDAPT Developing Center will be considered\nsuccessful if we achieve the following outcomes: (1) a robust, collaborative Implementation Laboratory with\npartners who are knowledgeable and experienced with implementation science in cancer control; (2)\ncompletion of 8 to 10 pilot projects related to iDAPTs emerging theme; (3) pilot grantees and lab partners are\nprepared to lead investigator initiated studies as a result of capacity building and pilot grant experiences; (4)\njunior faculty and underrepresented persons are engaged in all Center activities; (5) The field of\nimplementation science in cancer control is advanced aligned within iDAPT’s emerging theme; and (6) iDAPT\nis part of a new network of ISCCCs who collectively build the field of implementation science in cancer control.

Much of the\nfocus has been place on T cells, in particular via checkpoint therapies such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1. Little is\ncurrently known of how individual populations of myeloid cells can be partners for T cells. We have recently\nisolated rare populations of myeloid cells that appear critical for robust responses but we don't yet fully\nunderstand how they work. We hypothesize that rare stimulatory dendritic cells traffic antigens and stimulate\nT cell according to specialized rules and that harnessing and modulation of this pathway is part of the reason\nthat checkpoint blockades may work. We further hypothesize that specific tissue-based cells are responsible\nfor upregulating the critical cytokine to make stimulatory dendritic cells but that tissue production is\ndysregulated in cancer and possibly improved with checkpoint therapies.\nIn this proposal we will be vastly extending an approach that my lab has been pursuing over the last few years.\nSpecifically we will be extending our cell-biology based studies of these critical cells (Aim1) to understand how\nthey play a fundamental role in antigen trafficking. Additionally, we will seek to understand how they hand off\nantigen to other antigen-presenting cells in the lymph node to engage T cells (Aim2) and how both of these\nprocesses are affected by checkpoint blockades. Finally, in aim 3, we will seek to understand the normal and\nintratumoral production of the cytokine Flt3L, a key player in regulating the number of these rare cells.\nAt the end of this work, we will understand how these intratumoral myeloid cells function on their own\nand in concert with T cell therapies.

The intimate\nrelationship between gammaherpesviruses and B cell differentiation is directly linked to the\nlymphomagenic capacity of these viruses. To ensure the establishment of long-term latency in\nmemory B cells, gammaherpesviruses drive a unique polyclonal germinal center reaction during\nearly infection. Germinal center reaction represents a stage of B cell differentiation that is\ncharacterized by rapid division of activated B cells along with genetic instability driven by\nenzymes that either induce DNA breaks or mutagenize DNA. It is not surprising that most\nEpstein-Barr virus-driven B cell lymphomas originate from germinal center or post germinal\ncenter B cells. This robust, gammaherpesvirus-stimulated germinal center reaction is transient\nand returns to near-baseline levels in long-term infected hosts. Importantly, it is not clear what\nattenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. We have identified Interferon\nRegulatory Factor-1 (IRF-1) as the first host factor that specifically attenuates\ngammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. Studies proposed here test the hypothesis\nthat IRF-1 is the critical host factor that attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven expansion and\ntransformation of germinal center B cells throughout life-long infection. The proposed studies\nwill define IRF-1-mediated signaling changes that attenuate gammaherpesvirus-driven\nexpansion of germinal center response and the relative contributions of B- and T cell-intrinsic\nfunctions of IRF-1 to this process. Further, proposed studies will develop a novel animal model\nof gammaherpesvirus lymphomagenesis. Successful completion of the proposed studies will\noffer insights into the tumor suppressor mechanisms of IRF-1 and generate novel animal\nmodels that will be of value to infectious disease, immunology, and cancer fields.

Small animal, and in particular mouse, model systems are attractive to researchers\nfor numerous reasons, including their ease of use and well-described platforms. Immunotherapy has\nrevolutionized clinical oncology, but lacks pre-clinical models of the human immune system and human cancer\nto investigate new modalities and limitations/toxicities of treatment regimens. The ability to grow human tumors\nin immunodeficient mice (so-called patient-derived xenografts, or PDXs) allows researchers to work directly with\nhuman cancer tissue in a controlled setting. However, PDX models are limited by their lack of an intact immune\nsystem. The broad objective of this proposal is to validate an in vivo model to evaluate human tumors in\nthe context of a complete and intact human immune system in a completely personalized and autologous\nfashion. Herein, we propose to: (1) validate the ability to establish humanized mice from patients with\nmelanoma; (2) evaluate tumor growth and lymphocyte development in autologous human melanoma tumors\nestablished in humanized mice; and (3) validate the ability of this humanized system to serve as a model for\ncancer immunotherapy treatment response and toxicity. In each of these areas, we will leverage our multi-\ninstitutional team's individual expertise along with our institutional infrastructure to maximize the success of the\nexperimental aims. Furthermore, we will participate in the Oncology Models Forum and utilize the NCIP Hub\nresources to ensure that the methodology, data, and biologic model systems that result from this project are\nmade widely available to the general research community for future, hypothesis-driven research. Taken together,\nthe studies described in this research proposal will meet multiple goals and address several unmet needs\nidentified in this grant opportunity, thus significantly enhancing the applicability of a fully autologous and\nimmunocompetent precision model system for use in translational oncology research.

However,\ntargeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in\nglioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse\n(GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have\nprevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non-\ngermline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and\nchemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft\n(PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor\nbeads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en\nmasse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this\nMulti-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models\nagainst human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from\ndistinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will\ndevelop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that\nwill be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM\nmodels against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and\ndrug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to\ndevelop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically-\ndefined tumor subtypes. This work will therefore help realize the promise of precision medicine in neuro-\noncology.

RAF inhibitors\nvemurafenib and dabrafenib improved survival of melanoma patients with BRAF(V600E) tumors. Unfortunate-\nly, responses are usually temporary, followed by development of resistance, most commonly due to ineffective\ninhibition of RAF and reactivation of ERK signaling in the presence of the drug. In addition, RAF inhibitors in-\nduce second site tumors, due to RAS-dependent paradoxical activation of RAF and downstream ERK signaling\nin normal cells. Outside of melanoma, RAF inhibitors showed limited efficacy in patients colorectal and thyroid\nBRAF(V600E) tumors, also due to ineffective inhibition of RAF/ERK signaling in these tumors. More recently,\ncombinations of RAF and MEK inhibitors showed improved efficacy compared to RAF inhibitor monotherapy,\nbut resistance eventually emerges as well. Resistance mechanisms identified to the RAF/MEK inhibitor combi-\nnation are similar to the ones identified for RAF inhibitor monotherapy, suggesting that ineffective inhibition of\nRAF is a critical limiting factor in both contexts. There is thus a pressing need for improved therapeutic strate-\ngies targeting oncogenic BRAF, such that durable responses and minimal side effects can be achieved. Our\nprevious work showed that regulation of BRAF kinase by dimerization determines both the development of re-\nsistance to currently used RAF inhibitors and inhibitor-induced RAF paradoxical activation, but the underlying\nmechanisms remain incompletely understood. Recently, next generation RAF inhibitors with different structural\nand biochemical properties have entered preclinical and clinical development, but the most appropriate clinical\ncontext for their use is unknown. The goal of this proposal is to accomplish a detailed understanding of the\nmechanisms governing the targeting of oncogenic BRAF by small molecules inhibitors and to use this\nknowledge in order to design more effective RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies. More specifically, we\nwill 1) characterize the mechanistic basis of resistance to RAF inhibitors due to BRAF dimerization by linking\nthe conformational changes induced by inhibitor binding to BRAF to the biochemical effects of the inhibitor, 2)\ngain a detailed understanding of the biochemical mechanism of paradoxical RAF activation by inhibitors in cells\nwith wild-type BRAF and 3) identify effective RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies for tumors with dimeric\nBRAF that would overcome RAF dimer-mediated intrinsic or acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors. The mech-\nanistic insights gained by the proposed experiments will enable the rational design of more effective small mol-\necule inhibitors and RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies targeting oncogenic BRAF signaling, with mini-\nmal side effects and prolonged time to resistance.

While Ewing sarcoma is relatively\nrare, the biology of this disease is also relevant to non-Ewing sarcomas, and to other cancer subtypes, due to\nthe presence of the EWS/FLI translocation, the driving event in this disease. Similar translocations involving\nETS transcription factors occur in other malignancies, including prostate cancer. Thus, understanding the\nbiology of Ewing sarcoma may provide insight into many cancer types. We will investigate the role of\nsecondary genetic events in the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma. These secondary events have been\nidentified through next-generation sequencing of primary tumors and cell lines. Specifically, we will evaluate\nthe role of STAG2 in mediating epigenetic and transcriptional changes induced by the driving oncogene in\nEwing sarcoma, EWS/FLI.\nIn Aim 1, we will use genomic approaches (RNAseq, ChIPseq, WGS, etc.) to assess the mechanistic role of\nSTAG2 in the regulation of chromatin architecture, transcription, and aneuploidy in Ewing cells. In Aim 2, we\nwill study the role of STAG2 in progression, maintenance and metastasis in Ewing sarcoma, using functional\nstudies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In Aim 3, we will determine whether there\nis a synthetic lethal dependency on STAG1 when STAG2 is absent in Ewing sarcoma cells. Our central\nhypothesis is that STAG2 loss plays a key role in the epigenetic reprogramming that drives the oncogenic\nfunction of EWS/FLI.

project	1R01CA205426-01A1	R01CA205426	9239881	2017	Elucidating genetics of response to immune checkpoint blockade in lung cancer	Grant	Abstract\n Immune checkpoint inhibitors like ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) and nivolumab (anti-PD1) are\nrevolutionizing cancer treatment. Understanding the genetic basis of response and resistance to\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors are critical for improving outcomes with current agents and for\ndeveloping new ones. Patients can undergo dramatic remissions after treatment while others reap no\nbenefit. Furthermore, the immune phenotype shows substantial temperospatial variability and is\ninfluenced by multiple variables. The rationale of this project is that there is a fundamental genetic\nbasis underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors that is poorly understood. Our preliminary\ndata demonstrates that response to immune checkpoint blockade is strongly determined by the tumor\nmutation landscape and dictated by a specific neoantigen repertoire. We will apply a conceptually\nand technically innovative, systematic, multidisciplinary, and highly collaborative approach to\nelucidate the neoantigen landscape underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our\ncontribution here is expected to provide unparalleled mechanistic detail on how immune checkpoint\ninhibitors function and to provide biomarkers to identify patients who will benefit from PD-1 blockade.\nFurthermore, building on data showing that resistance may be mediated by immune pressure and\nimmunoediting, we will shed light into how resistance to these drugs develop, providing definitive\nevidence for causal mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity. Should our work succeed, we envision\nsubstantial utility for similar studies for other cancers. Such an understanding will provide great insight\ninto the mechanisms underlying how immune checkpoint blockade works, provide much needed\nprecise biomarkers, and establish a foundation to develop more effective immunotherapy.

MIND involves injection of epithelial cells derived from patient DCIS into the\nmammary ducts of immunocompromised mice. DCIS MIND xenografts exhibited the full spectrum of human\nDCIS including invasive progression. Histology of xenografted DCIS lesions that progressed to invasion\nshowed disruption of basement membrane and myoepithelial layer by the invasive cells, retraction of\nmyoepithelial layer and microinvasion. Therefore, the DCIS MIND model is a valuable tool for studying the\nearly molecular mechanisms underlying DCIS invasive progression in a manner that is individualized to each\npatient DCIS. This proposal that is aimed at further improving the translation application of MIND models by\nmimicking the natural microenvironment of human DCIS in mice, is directly responsive to this FOA. The\nfollowing specific aims (SA) are proposed: SA 1) Humanize mouse mammary fat pads with patient derived\nimmortalized fibroblasts and study effects on DCIS progression to invasion, pathology and biomarker\nexpression. The DCIS xenografts ± humanized fat pads will be assessed for pathology, biomarker expression\nand progression to invasion. We expect the xenografted DCIS with humanized mammary fat pads to more\nclosely resemble patient DCIS with respect to pathology and biomarker expression. We also expect the\nhumanized fat pads to enhance DCIS invasive progression in a fraction of DCIS MIND xenografts. Additionally,\nwe will correlate DCIS epithelial cell inherent molecular aberrations (gene expression and/or genomic\naberrations) to DCIS invasive behavior in the DCIS MIND xenografts. SA 2) Reconstitute the mouse\nhematopoietic system with patient derived immune cells and study effects on DCIS progression to\ninvasion, pathology and biomarker expression. The experimental procedure involves reconstitution of\nmouse hematopoietic system with patient derived immune cells. We will utilize MISTRG mice, which are highly\npermissive for human hematopoiesis including support of the development and function of monocytes,\nmacrophages and NK cells. DCIS xenografts ± patient derived immune system will be assessed for human\nimmune cell infiltration to DCIS, DCIS pathology and invasive behavior as described in SA 1. We will correlate\nthe recruitment of specific immune cells to DCIS as well as DCIS epithelial cell inherent molecular aberrations\n(gene expression and/or genomic aberrations) to DCIS invasive behavior in the MIND xenografts.

project	1R01CA208205-01A1	R01CA208205	9403496	2017	Reengineering obesity-induced abnormal microenvironment to improve PDAC treatment	Grant	ABSTRACT\nObesity is a worldwide public health problem, and its incidence is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity associates\nwith increased risk and worse prognosis of many malignancies including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\nHowever, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Obesity induces a pro-inflammatory state both locally\nin adipose tissue and systemically in visceral organs such as the pancreas. PDAC is a highly desmoplastic/fibrotic\ntumor in which angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) signaling activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), contributing to\nsolid stress (the mechanical force exerted by the solid components of the tumor). We have recently shown that obesity-\ninduced inflammation worsens the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME), and compromises perfusion,\noxygenation and chemotherapy in PDACs (Cancer Discovery 2016). Our preliminary data suggest that obesity increases\ntumor stiffness and solid stress, which compress blood vessels and hinder the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic\ntherapy. The desmoplastic reaction also promotes pro-survival signaling in cancer cells. We also found crosstalk\nbetween fibrotic (AT1) and inflammatory (interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) signaling pathways in PDACs in obese mice. These\nabnormalities also promote immunosuppression. Building on these exciting findings, we will further dissect molecular\nand mechanical mechanisms and develop novel strategies to overcome these obesity-induced biomechanical barriers\nto successful therapy in PDACs. We hypothesize that targeting AT1 and/or IL-1β will alleviate obesity-induced\ndesmoplasia and reprogram the immune TME. To this end, we will study spontaneous and orthotopic PDAC\nmice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) in both primary and liver metastasis settings. These PDAC models have\nsuccessfully recapitulated clinical disease. We will characterize mechanical properties of PDACs in DIO using a newly\ndeveloped approach together with the assessment of biochemical and cellular microenvironment. We will assess the\neffect of novel TME-activated AT1 blockers (TMA-ARBs), which allow delivery of high-dose ARBs to tumors while\navoiding systemic hypotension We will also study the FDA approved IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) on\nobesity-altered PDAC biomechanics, and on inflammatory cytokines and cells in obesity (Aim 1). We will evaluate if\nTMA-ARBs/ IL-1Ra can reprogram immune TME in PDACs with obesity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how\nelevated solid stress and stiffness alter tumor cells and host stromal cells using in vitro engineered microenvironments\nwith the results being tested in vivo (Aim 3). We anticipate that TMA-ARBs and/or IL-1Ra will alleviate desmoplasia\nand inflammation in PDACs in obese mice, reprogram ECM and immune TME and facilitate both conventional\nchemotherapy and immune checkpoint blocker immunotherapy. If successful, these studies will lead to the\ndevelopment of novel treatment strategies for obese PDAC patients. These novel treatments can be rapidly translated\ninto the clinic based on our track record of successful clinical translation in collaboration with outstanding clinicians.

To achieve this goal, methods for scaling up evidence-based programs from research to wide-\nscale dissemination are needed to help balance effectiveness and cost. In many cases, there are pressures to\nreduce scale-up costs but at the expense of lower program implementation and effectiveness. A scale-up\nmethod that sacrifices effectiveness but reduces costs and reaches a larger number of employers may be\nacceptable. We will model the effectiveness and cost trade-off, along with the extent and representativeness of\nreach, when scaling up our evidence-based occupational sun protection intervention, Sun Safe Workplaces\n(SSW), for national distribution. The intervention, which relies on personal contact with managers and in-\nperson employee training (SSW-IP), created large improvements in comprehensive workplace sun safety (i.e.,\npolicy adoption and employee education) in a randomized controlled trial. We will compare the existing in-\nperson program delivery methods (SSW-IP) to a lower-cost dissemination method that utilizes Internet\ntechnology (SSW-T), i.e., virtual meetings, social networking, online training, and program materials. The aims\nof the research are to: 1) estimate the program reach (number and representativeness) and implementation\nrates (i.e., adoption of policies and delivery of education on occupational sun protection) achieved by the SSW-\nIP and SSW-T in a model of national distribution to public safety and public works industries; 2) estimate the\ncosts associated with the SSW-IP and SSW-T (i.e., intervention costs and induced employer costs) and compare\nthe estimated program benefits (i.e., policy and education) to cost; and 3) estimate the effect and cost-\neffectiveness of SSW-IP and SSW-T in secondary outcomes of a) changes in workplace environments and\nprocedures for sun safety and b) workers’ sun safety practices. In a 5-year project, SSW-T will be created by\nredesigning our very effective SSW-IP methods to use the latest web conferencing, social networking, and\nonline training technology for dissemination. The implementation rates (defined as policy adoption and\neducation delivery) and costs associated with SSW-IP (n=50 employers) and SSW-T (n=150 employers) will be\nmodeled in a randomized two-group pretest-posttest design, enrolling a national sample of 200 employers (i.e.,\nfirefighting departments and state departments of transportation). Unlike traditional randomized trials, the\nprimary analysis will be of cost effectiveness to test the hypothesis that SSW-T can be delivered cost-effectively\nto an expanded group of worksites producing a lower implementation rate than SSW-IP but at substantially\nlower cost. Secondary analyses will compare the two scale-up strategies on implementation rate, differences in\nrate by employer groups (e.g., size and region), changes to workplace environment/procedures, and employee\nsun safety practices. The findings will have high impact by helping public health practitioners select the best\nstrategy for scaling up evidence-based workplace health and safety programs to achieve this ACA goal.

Paradoxically, although estrogens stimulate breast cancers, risk rises markedly after menopause,\nwhen estrogens decrease. After menopause, estradiol falls and estrone is produced largely in fat by\naromatase. Obesity women have high estrone, and both obesity and high estrone, but not estradiol, increase\nER+ breast cancer risk after menopause. Low intra-tumor levels of enzymes converting estrone into estradiol,\nand elevation of enzymes that produce estrone both confer worse ER+ breast cancer outcome.\n Obesity mediates chronic inflammation through NF-κB driven cytokine expression. We showed contact\nbetween invading breast cancer cells and obese adipose tissue induces pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cell\ntypes that stimulate cancer stem cells (CSC) and drive metastasis. Our data suggest that cytokine induction\nafter breast fat:cancer cell contact is estrogen:ER dependent, since blocking estrogen synthesis with the\naromatase inhibitor, letrozole, reduced cytokine induction upon co-culture. While estradiol is known to oppose\nNF-κB mediated inflammation, the role of estrone in inflammation is not known and may differ from that of\nestradiol. We will study how estrone and estradiol, and changes in the ratios thereof before and after-\nmenopause, may influence NF-κB activity and the pro-inflammatory state in obese postmenopausal women.\n We hypothesize that increased estrone:estradiol ratio after menopause shifts ER from an NF-κB co-\nrepressor to a co-activator to up-regulate cytokines in obese adipocytes and cancer cells that drive CSC\nexpansion and metastasis. We also posit that enzymes that convert estradiol to estrone may contribute to the\npoor outcome of ER+ cancers in obesity. Aim 1 will test if estradiol:ER decreases, estrone:ER increases or\ndifferent estradiol:estrone ratios alter ER effects on NF-κB mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine\ngene drivers of CSCs in ER+ breast cancer cells. To test in Aim 2 if estrone cooperates with obesity to drive\nER+ breast cancer initiation and growth, we will co-culture human ER+ breast cancer cells with mammary\nadipocytes from women with different body mass index (BMI) +/- aromatase inhibition and test consequences\non cytokine levels and CSC. We will also implant syngeneic breast cancers into lean or obese wild-type or\naromatase knock-out mice to elucidate if host estrone mediates tumor promoting effects of obesity. Aim 3 will\ntest if overexpression of HSD17B14, that converts estradiol to estrone, increases ER+ breast cancer cytokine\nexpression and CSC in vitro, and increases tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo. We will also compare levels\nof estradiol/estrone interconversion enzymes in breast adipocytes and cancers from lean, overweight and\nobese women. A better understanding of the roles of estradiol and estrone may lead to new strategies for\nbreast cancer prevention and treatment, and to changes in hormone replacement therapies. Shifting toward a\nhigher estradiol: estrone ratio in serum or in breast cancer cells may prove to have therapeutic potential.

Although surgery is effective in early stage cancers, the median survival of women with advanced endometrial cancer is less than one year, and in the past 30 years there have been no major improvements in the treatment of advanced disease.  Neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy significantly increases long‐term survival, and there are no therapies (targeted or conventional) effective against metastatic disease.  Endometrial cancer research has lagged behind other cancers in grant allocation and progress relative to its clinical impact.  More recently, systematic genome‐wide sequencing efforts, such as the National Cancer Institute’s The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have brought the endometrial cancer genetic landscape into much clearer focus.  These studies have yielded many previously unsuspected endometrial cancer tumor suppressor genes (such as FBXW7) altered in a large percentage of cases, and thus of obvious clinical and research significance.  Cancers are complex amalgamations of various cell types that interact in myriad ways not only with one another, but also with the host organism.  Hence, many features of cancer cannot be modelled in vitro.  Consequently, in vivo genetic animal models are needed to further our understanding of these newly‐discovered genetic driver events in endometrial cancer.  Genetically‐engineered mouse models of endometrial cancer have lagged considerably relative to other types of cancer, and such models remain to be generated for most of the frequent endometrial cancer driver events.  One significant limitation has been the lack of fully optimized in vivo genetic models and the genetic tools to generate such models.  We propose to build upon prior efforts and employ a general, validated strategy to build a suite of genetic tools useful for the generation and characterization of diverse mouse models of invasive and lethal endometrial cancer.  The wide availability of this fully‐credentialed suite of genetic tools will bring new investigators into the field and greatly catalyze the development and use of clinically‐relevant mouse models of endometrial cancer.  These models and the diverse array of translational investigations they will foster will lead to new insights into the biology of these endometrial cancer driver genes and also aid in the identification of potential Achilles’ heels that can be exploited for treatment.\n \n 	Ablation;Age;Alleles;Animal Cancer Model;Animal Genetics;Animal Model;Animals;Biological;Biological Models;Biology;Cancer Model;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Research;Complex;Credentialing;Development;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Endometrial;Endometrial Carcinoma;Endometrial Neoplasms;Epithelial Cells;Epithelium;Estrogens;Event;FBXW7 gene;Female;Fostering;Future;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Recombination;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Human;Image;Imagery;Incidence;Investigation;Lead;Life;Luciferases;Maintenance;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Modeling;Monitor;Mosaicism;Mouse Strains;Mutate;Mutation;National Cancer Institute;Neoplasm Metastasis;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organism;PTEN gene;Pattern;Penetrance;Performance;Proteins;Proteomics;Radiation therapy;Reporter;Research Personnel;Specificity;System;Testing;Tetanus Helper Peptide;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Tissues;Translational Research;Tumor Promotion;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Ubiquitination;Uterus;Variant;Woman;advanced disease;anticancer research;base;cancer genetics;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell type;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;combinatorial;exome sequencing;flexibility;genome-wide;improved;in vitro Model;in vivo;in vivo Model;insight;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;oncogene addiction;pre-clinical;prevent;prognostic;reproductive tract;response;targeted treatment;theranostics;tool;translational cancer research;translational study;tumor;ubiquitin-protein ligase	UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER	DALLAS	TX	UNITED STATES	DIEGO H CASTRILLON	DCB	Neeraja  Sathyamoorthy	570932	$500k to $749k	570932	3-Mar-2017	3-Mar-2017	28-Feb-2020	PAR-16-059	Moonshot

People with\nLynch syndrome are also at increased risk for endometrial, ovarian, gastric, small bowel, and\nrenal cancers. Importantly, well-established clinical guidelines with strong evidence exist for\ncancer treatment, screening, and prevention in individuals with LS. Identification of individuals\nwith LS is accomplished through a variety of techniques, including family and medical history\nevaluation, computational models, or tumor testing. The systematic screening of all colorectal\ntumors for LS was first recommended by the Evaluation of Genetic Application in Practice and\nPrevention (EGAPP) working group in 2009 and has been designated high priority by the\nNational Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine working group and by the Blue\nRibbon Panel. The potential public health impact to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality of this\nintervention supports this priority, as effective implementation of LS screening will help meet the\ngoals of the Cancer Moonshot as well as demonstrate the promise of precision medicine.\nCurrently, implementation of LS screening in healthcare systems remains suboptimal for a\nvariety of reasons. LS screening involves the coordination of multiple departments and\nindividuals across an organization, which is often difficult in large, complex, healthcare systems.\nTherefore, the overarching goal of this project is to utilize tools from implementation science to\ndescribe, explain, and compare decision making and other variations in LS screening\nimplementation across multiple healthcare systems to create and evaluate in a real world setting\nan organizational toolkit to facilitate implementation of LS screening. Our specific aims are to (1)\nDescribe variation in LS screening implementation across multiple healthcare systems; then (2)\nExplain practice variation and determine factors associated with optimal implementation; and (3)\nDetermine the relative effectiveness, efficiency, and costs of different LS screening protocols by\nhealthcare system; and finally to (4) Develop and test in a natural environment an organizational\ntoolkit for LS screening. This toolkit will enable effective implementation of LS screening\nprograms; ultimately preventing needless suffering of patients and their family members from\npreventable cancers, decreasing waste in healthcare system costs, and informing strategies to\nfacilitate the promise of precision medicine.

Mice can also be\ngenetically engineered to study specific oncogenic pathways. Given the many positives associated with murine\nmodels, the vast majority of pre-clinical anti-cancer therapeutic studies are performed in a mouse.\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of oncology drugs (~94%) that are effective in murine tumor studies will\nultimately fail when tested in humans. These failures cost billions of dollars and waste physician and patient\nresources. Clearly, current preclinical mouse tumor models are not accurately predicting a patients’ response\nto therapy. Thus current mouse models need to be improved to more accurately reflect human disease. Each\nof the currently available mouse models of human cancer has distinct strengths, but also critical flaws. One\ncritical flaw in all available preclinical models is the lack of human tumor stroma. However, work from our\ngroup and others demonstrates that human tumor stroma is a critical component of the human tumor\nmicroenvironment which promotes human tumor growth, metastasis, suppresses anti-tumor immunity, and\ninduces therapeutic resistance.\nOur long term goal is to develop a human tumor model that will, by better representing human tumors, will\nbetter cancer therapeutic response seen in human clinical trials. We hypothesize that a human tumor model\nwith both human cancer cells and human tumor stroma will better represent primary human disease. As such,\nit will be a better/more stringent model for preclinical drug screening that could ultimately prevent a drug which\nis destined to fail from being used in clinical trials. We further hypothesize that human tumor stroma will better\nmaintain tumor cell heterogeneity over time to more accurately reflect the natural evolution of therapeutic\nresistance. Finally such a model will be ideal for evaluating the impact of human tumor stroma on novel\nimmune cell therapies. We propose to use a combination of human adult stem cells and cancer associated\nstem cells to create human tumor model with both human cancer cells and stromal cells. We will perform\nextensive histological and molecular profiling to confirm this model reflects primary tumor. Finally, we will (i)\nevaluate the models ability to predict patient response to disease in a retrospective study and (ii) assess the\nuse of this model to evaluate novel immunotherapies using a novel CAR T-cell construct targeting ovarian\ncancer cells.

Pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasias (PanINs)\nrepresent an early, localized developmental stage of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), when\ncurative surgical resection remains feasible. Understanding features of PDA precursor lesions like\nPanINs could generate new strategies for early PDA diagnosis and intervention. We have created a\nnovel system for genetic modification and growth of primary human pancreatic cells to reconstitute the\ndevelopment of lesions with molecular and pathological features of human PanINs. Upon orthotopic\ntransplantation these immortalized clones produce stable human induced pancreatic intra-epithelial\nneoplasias (hiPanINs). Moreover, these PanIN lesions appear to be stable: after 6 months, they do not\ninvade locally or metastasize. Here we propose to validate and optimize this new system for generating\nstable human PanIN-like lesions to enhance its uses for addressing unmet translational needs. In Aim 1\nwe propose to generate new hiPanIN clones whose mutational spectrum matches that found in native\nPanIN and PDA development. We will also assess prioritized biomarkers identified in the hiPanIN system\nin native human PanIN and PDA specimens. In Aim 2 we propose collaborative studies to test whether\npancreatitis, further genetic modification, or extrinsic signals relevant to PDA can promote invasive or\nmetastatic PDA in the hiPanIN orthotopic transplantation model. In summary our proposal is highly\nresponsive to the FOA (PAR 16-059).

This caveat is particularly relevant for melanoma, given the pivotal role the immune system plays in\nits development. To address these limitations, we plan to study melanoma biology and therapy in a humanized\nmouse (HM) model. We initially developed a mis-matched HM (mHM; tumor and hematopoietic stem cells\n[HSCs] from different sources), and now have generated an autologous HM (aHM; tumor, HSCs and\nmesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] from the same patient). In HM bearing tumors the human immune and\nmesenchymal cells from the patient's bone marrow homed into the growing tumor, migrated into the pre-\nexisting mouse stroma, and interacted with the human cancer cells. Tumors grown in HM more closely\nresembled the originator tumor than those grown in non-HM mice, and the drift in gene expression caused by\nprior passaging was partially reversed. Signaling in key immune and stroma pathways was more prominent\nand closely resembled the originator patient in HM vs. non-HM models. The immune cells mounted effective\ntumor-specific immune responses, mediated by human immune cells including T cells. Significantly, immune\nresponses upon immune therapies in the HM melanoma models showed a correlation with the patient's\ntherapy results. Two salient and under-studied issues limit the wider application of HM: The relevance of the\ndegree of tumor and immune matching, which can affect the faithfulness of immune response, and that can\nonly be appreciated by comparing mHM and aHM. A second criticism to HM is xenogenic education of human T\ncells on mouse thymic cells, resulting from the lack of a functional human thymus in such models. In this\napplication we will further address the relevance of an autologous versus mis-matched HM to test which\napproach gives rise to a more representative model of melanoma; secondly, using the same precursor cells\nfrom the patient we will reconstitute a functional thymus. The overarching goal of this proposal is to conduct a\nco-clinical trial where we will accomplish the following: 1) prospectively generate and characterize aHM and\nmHM from 20 melanoma patients, 2) test which approach yields a more representative melanoma HM model,\n3) test in HM the immune drugs (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA4] and programmed cell\ndeath protein 1 [PD-1] inhibitors) that each patient received and correlate with the clinical data, 4) identify the\nmechanisms involved in resistance to CTLA4/PD-1 inhibitors; and finally as an exploratory Aim in selected\ncases, we will 5) generate thymic epithelium from the same patient's HSCs that will result in HM with a fully\nautologous melanoma, thymus and immune system, thus enabling immune cell education in a strictly human\ncontext. This project will advance our understanding of the tumor-host interaction in melanoma and human\ncancer, by better characterizing the interplay between melanoma cells and the immune and stroma systems,\nleading to the discovery of new approaches to improve personalization of therapy and improve outcomes.

State-\nlevel practitioners are in ideal positions to affect programs and policies related to cancer control. Mis-\nimplementation refers to ending effective programs and policies or continuing ineffective ones. Greater\nattention to mis-implementation should lead to use of effective interventions and more efficient expenditure of\nresources, which in the long term, will lead to positive cancer outcomes.\nGOAL: This proposal seeks to describe the extent of cancer control mis-implementation and to identify\nleverage points for addressing mis-implementation in the United States.\nAIMS AND METHODS: This is a three-phase study that takes a comprehensive approach, leading to the\nelucidation of tactics for addressing mis-implementation. Phase 1: The first aim seeks to assess the extent to\nwhich mis-implementation is occurring among state cancer control programs in public health. This initial phase\nwill involve a survey of 800 practitioners representing all states. The programs represented will span the full\ncontinuum of cancer control (from prevention to survivorship). Phase 2: Using data from Phase 1 to identify\norganizations in which mis-implementation is high or low, we will conduct eight comparative case studies to\nunderstand contextual differences. These case studies will highlight lessons learned about mis-implementation\nand identify hypothesized drivers. Phase 3: The 3rd aim seeks to build agent-based models to identify dynamic\ninteractions between individual, organizational, and contextual (external) factors driving mis-implementation.\nAgent-based modeling will be used to determine the most effective potential approaches for reducing mis-\nimplementation. We will translate and disseminate findings from Phases 1-3 to practitioners and practice-\nrelated stakeholders in order to support the reduction of mis-implementation. All study phases will rely on an\nAdvisory Group of public health practitioners and close collaboration with key practice partners.\nINNOVATIONS AND IMPACT: This study is innovative and impactful because it will: 1) be the first to refine\nand further develop reliable and valid measures of mis-implementation of public health programs; 2) bring\ntogether a strong, transdisciplinary team with significant expertise in practice-based research; 3) use agent-\nbased modeling to address cancer control implementation; and 4) use a participatory, evidence-based,\nstakeholder-driven approach that will identify key leverage points for addressing mis-implementation among\nstate public health programs. This research is expected to result in a replicable model that can significantly\nimpact mis-implementation in cancer control and can be applied to other health areas.

project	1R01CA214669-01A1	R01CA214669	9380179	2017	Exploring a promising design for the next generation time-of-flight PET detector	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nWe propose to study a promising candidate for the next generation time-of-flight (TOF)-positron emission\ntomography (PET) annihilation photon detector. By enabling significant increases in the reconstructed\nimage signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), TOF-PET has demonstrated\nsubstantial clinical impact on the visualization and quantification of molecular signatures of cancer in\npatients. In particular it has been shown to improve image quality and accuracy in count starved and\ncontrast limited lesion detection scenarios. The effective photon sensitivity boost provided by TOF can\nalso be exploited to significantly reduce injected dose to the patient and/or study duration, factors that\nwould make PET more practical, cost-effective, and safe for a variety of clinical cancer imaging\napplications. Thus, studies that further advance the TOF-PET technique, and photon sensitivity in\ngeneral, are highly worthwhile. The key to better TOF-PET performance is to improve the annihilation\nphoton pair coincidence time resolution (CTR) measured between any two detection elements in the\nsystem, which has been a focus of research for the past two decades. Current commercially available\nPET systems achieve a CTR of roughly 350 to 800 ps full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). A goal of this\nproposal is to employ a novel scintillation detection configuration in order to achieve 100 ps FWHM CTR,\nwithout compromising other important performance parameters. This novel configuration also enables\nanother capability not possible with the conventional PET detector: The ability to measure the energy and\nthree-dimensional (3D) position of one or more annihilation photon interactions in the detector. Owing to\nthe fact that most incoming 511 keV photons undergo inter-crystal Compton scatter in the detectors, we\ncan exploit the kinematics of that process to estimate the photon angle-of-incidence. If successful, that\ncapability enables us to accurately position the first interaction of such multi-crystal events, but also offers\nthe potential to retain a high fraction of photon events that are normally rejected by a conventional PET\nsystem, such as single (unpaired) photons, random coincidences, tissue-scatter coincidences, and\nmultiple (>2) photon coincidences. Since these normally-discarded events are over 10-fold more\nprobable than true coincidence events in a standard PET study, this 3D position sensitive detector shows\npromise as another method to greatly boost photon sensitivity. If successful, this resulting substantial\nphoton sensitivity increase, along with the substantial image SNR enhancement possible with 100 ps\nCTR would enable PET to be more sensitive, accurate, and practical for cancer imaging. In this project\nwe will design and develop these next-generation detectors, integrate these modules into a prototype\npartial-ring PET system, and compare image quality and accuracy available with this partial-ring system\nto a state-of-the-art whole body TOF-PET system currently installed in our imaging clinic.

project	1R01CA215034-01	R01CA215034	9285367	2017	Comparative Effectiveness of Fecal Immunochemical Tests with Optical Colonoscopy	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in both\nmen and women in the U.S., with nearly 50,000 deaths each year. Since CRC develops over a number of\nyears from precursor lesions called polyps, it is largely detectable and preventable in early stages. As these\npolyps become larger, they, like most CRCs, tend to bleed, which is the rationale for the use of fecal occult\nblood tests (FOBTs) to detect both polyps and cancers early, while they are curable. However, early\nscreening and detection is much less common than it could be, with about 43% of eligible individuals\nunscreened. Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) are a type of FOBT that can be a sensitive, specific, and low-\ncost alternative to colonoscopy for CRC screening. Modeling studies have shown that for population screening,\na strategy of annual FIT testing from age of 50 to 75 years results in an equal number of life-years gained as\ncompared with colonoscopy every 10 years. However, about 90% of screening in the U.S. is done with\ncolonoscopy, the most expensive and invasive screening test. FITs are far less costly and largely replacing the\nguaiac test in CRC screening programs internationally, where only individuals with positive results are referred\nfor a colonoscopy. Studies done on FITs in other countries often used FITs not available in the U.S. or studied\nhigh-risk populations; thus, results are not applicable in the U.S. It is critical to determine the FIT(s) with the\nbest test characteristics in order to implement successful FIT-based screening programs in this country.\nIt is estimated that 24 million more individuals will need to be screened by 2018 to reach the “80% by\n2018” goal set by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. To address this knowledge gap, we propose\nto compare the test characteristics of three CLIA-waived FITs and two automated FITs, using colonoscopy\nas the gold standard. The rationale for this proposed study is that, for almost all of the FITs currently marketed\nin the U.S., there is no evidence of the accuracy claimed. Our aims are:\n Aim 1: To assess the diagnostic accuracy for advanced colorectal neoplasms of three of the most\n commonly used CLIA-waived FITs and two automated FITs, using colonoscopy as the gold standard.\n Aim 2: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two quantitative FITs using receiver operating characteristic\n (ROC) analysis.\n Aim 3: To assess factors associated with false positive and false negative FIT results for each device.\nThese findings will provide essential information about FITs with the best test characteristics for future\nexpanded use of FIT, critically important to achieving our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality\nfrom CRC. FITs are more acceptable to patients, will allow higher screening rates, and will reduce costs as\ncompared with a screening strategy based on colonoscopy as the primary initial screening method.

Furthermore,\nlower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality\noutcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more\neffective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and\nmortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have\ntargeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a\nstatistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web-\nenabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms\nwill be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider\ncommunication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot\ntrial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly\nreminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control\ngroup (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding\nthe intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to\ndevelop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term\neffects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample\npowered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1)\nan “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group\n(n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a\n“Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET\nadherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning\nsymptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable\nalerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long-\nterm adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures,\nincluding AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will\nprovide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the\n“Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience.

project	1R01CA218156-01	R01CA218156	9369617	2017	Optimizing remotely delivered Smoking Cessation Services for Low-Income Smokers	Grant	ABSTRACT\nCigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer and many other deadly diseases, and the burden\nof tobacco use is greatest among those with limited socioeconomic resources. Although we have driven down\npopulation smoking rates, and with them, cancer rates, roughly 28% of the socioeconomically disadvantaged\nstill smoke regularly. Low-income (L-I) smokers also develop cancer at higher rates and struggle more to quit\nthan do higher-income smokers. These disparities in tobacco use and its burdens must be addressed. Highly\neffective cessation treatment services that can be delivered remotely, flexibly, and conveniently with few cost\nor logistical barriers have the potential to achieve this aim. Tobacco quitline and SmokefreeTXT services are\nsuch treatment resources with demonstrated attractiveness and reach among L-I smokers. The current\nproposal will use an efficient factorial design to evaluate 4 smoking cessation interventions with vast reach and\ndissemination potential. The target population will be N=1,408 Medicaid-eligible or uninsured smokers who\nhave recently enrolled in the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL), but who report continued smoking 4-\nmonths following engagement in standard WTQL services. These treatment non-responders will be invited to\nparticipate in an experiment that will randomize them to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following 4 factors in a\n2X2X2X2 design: WTQL counseling intensity (1 session vs. 4 sessions), medication intensity (2-week nicotine\npatch monotherapy vs. 4-week nicotine patch and lozenge combination therapy), a supportive text messaging\nprogram (SmokefreeTXT vs. none), and financial incentives (rewards of up to $150 for treatment engagement\nvs. no treatment incentives). The primary outcome will be 26-week biochemically confirmed point-prevalence\nabstinence. Analyses will examine the main and interactive effects of these 4 treatment components on 26-\nweek and secondary abstinence outcomes to identify the components and combinations of components that\nsignificantly enhance success in quitting in this high-risk population. This experiment will identify especially\neffective combinations of highly scalable interventions of modest cost and few barriers that could be\ndisseminated nationally to reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking cessation among those seeking to\nquit. Additional analyses will: compare intervention components and promising component combinations in\nterms of cost-effectiveness, examine whether or not treatment engagement differs across component\ncombinations, examine baseline variables that may moderate treatment response, and identify mediators of\ntreatment effects on abstinence outcomes. Because delivery of the study interventions can be centralized\nthrough established and efficient services (WTQL and SmokefreeTXT), the potential for both scalable\ndissemination and cost-effectiveness of the interventions tested is great. The proposed research will help\nidentify ways to reduce tobacco cessation disparities in L-I smokers who have tried to quit smoking but\nrelapsed and may benefit from improved assistance.

Project summary/abstract\nPROJECT: Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of\nHPV+ women who have performed self-collection\nCervical cancer is a serious public health problem reflecting social and gender inequalities in health. It is the\nthird cause of cancer death among women in the world, with more than 85% of cases occurring in developing\ncountries. Currently, the development of new technologies based on HPV DNA detection allows HPV self-\ncollection, increasing screening coverage. In a self-collection based strategy, triage becomes a key step in the\nprevention process, as it is the first method to identify HPV+ women who will need diagnostic and treatment\nprocedures. However, high adherence to triage is difficult to obtain, which is not surprising given that\nadherence to follow-up and treatment is a generalized problem in cervical cancer programs.\nSpecific aims of the study are: 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative multi-component mHealth\nintervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests compared to usual\ncare. 2. To evaluate the implementation strategy and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the\nmulti-component mHealth intervention.\nThe research study design will follow the structure of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial, and\nwill use mix-method approach. A cluster randomized trial including 200 CHWs (clusters) and 4000 women will\nbe used to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to\ncytology triage at 120 days after positive HPV testing. The mHealth intervention will include SMS messages\nsent to HPV+ women to inform them when results are available, and subsequent SMS messages as\nreminders. In addition, for those HPV+ women who did not had a triage cytology result within 60 days of the\nHPV test result, CHWs will receive an e-mail and SMS message so they can contact these women during\nhome visits for specific counseling and support. For the implementation evaluation, the Consolidated\nFramework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to guide qualitative data collection and analysis\nof factors that influence implementation. RE-AIM will be used to assess the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,\nImplementation and Maintenance of the Intervention.\nResults of this project will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention\nto increase triage of HPV+ women, but it could be adapted to increase compliance of diagnoses/ treatment of\ncervical cancer and other health problems. Findings from the implementation evaluation will be highly\napplicable to programs that use or are planning to incorporate HPV self-collection in different settings and\ncountries. In addition, the use of CFIR and RE-AIM in this innovative study will serve as a model of work,\nconstituting an important advance in the use of Implementation Science in the Region.

project	1R01CA221290-01	R01CA221290	9403804	2017	Metabolic reprogramming of Tregs in tumor immunity	Grant	Program Description/Abstract\nMetabolic reprogramming is a fundamental process underlying the growth of cancer cells and activated\nlymphocytes. These rapidly dividing cells markedly upregulate aerobic glycolysis (Warburg metabolism) and\nalso reprogram mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to support the energy and growth\ndemands. Moreover, mTOR signaling is a central regulator of anabolic metabolism in cancer cells and\nlymphocytes. While Warburg and mitochondrial metabolism and mTOR signaling are being actively studied, we\nare just beginning to appreciate the involvement of other biosynthetic programs such as de novo lipid synthesis\n(lipogenesis). Emerging evidence highlights that cancer immunotherapy is a powerful tool to combat cancers,\nbut immune tolerance mediated by immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) represents a major obstacle\nfor effective anti-tumor immunity. Although mTOR was generally considered a crucial negative regulator of\nTregs, our genetic studies have revealed that mTORC1 is a pivotal positive determinant of Treg function by\nlinking immune signals to the lipogenic program. In our preliminary studies, disruption of the lipogenic program\nin Tregs rendered the mice to reject tumor cells but did not cause obvious autoimmune disorders under steady\nstate. We hypothesize that lipogenic program contributes to Treg suppressive activity in the tumor\nmicroenvironment, which could represent a novel target for cancer immunotherapy. We will test this hypothesis\nby establishing the roles of Treg lipogenic programs in tumor immunity, and determining the metabolic and\nsignaling basis whereby lipogenesis programs Treg functions. We predict these studies will establish a new\nparadigm on our understanding of lipogenic program in Tregs and how this impinges upon tumor immunity.\nInsights gained from this project will likely lead to innovative strategies on cancer immunotherapy by\ncapitalizing on metabolic reprogramming of Tregs.

project	1R01CA226776-01	R01CA226776	9497626	2018	Novel Uses of PI3K-inhibitors for the Treatment of advanced PIK3CA-mutant Breast Cancer	Grant	Summary. Our proposal addresses the problem of advanced, PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. We propose a\nrole for PI3K-inhibitors in this disease at a stage when the disease no longer responds to endocrine\nmanipulation, cdk4/6- or mTOR-inhibition and when patients typically receive palliative chemotherapy. These\npre-treated tumors frequently display increased glucose avidity as evidenced by high SUVmax values in 18FDG-\nPET-scans and highly active glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect. 30 - 40% of breast tumors have\nactivating PIK3CA mutations, and these co-occur with expression of estrogen receptor (ER). There are current\nclinical trial efforts aimed using modern PI3K-inhibitors (PI3Ki) GDC0032, Copanlisib or Gedatolisib to restore\nresponsiveness to ER blockade, but studies to integrate these drugs at a later stage of PIK3CA-mutant BC are\nlacking. Here we propose a role for these more modern PI3K-inhibitors at later stages of the disease,\nwhen PIK3CA-mutant tumors have developed endocrine, cdk4/6i and mTORi resistance. We have\nrecently discovered that PI3Ki work by disrupting an AKT-independent pathway that regulates glycolysis\nand sustains the Warburg effect, in addition to the disruption of canonical signaling pathways via AKT. In this\npathway PI3K triggers the mobilization and release of aldolase from the cytoskeleton, and this in turn\npotentiates aldolase activity and the Warburg effect. This basic mechanism links PI3K signaling with\ncytoskeletal dynamics and enhanced glycolytic flux. To what extent PI3Ki efficacy is determined by the\nability to inhibit aldolase and to suppress the Warburg effect in advanced cancer, is still unknown and will be\nexamined here. We propose that the activating PIK3CA mutation fuels the carbohydrate metabolism of\nPIK3CA-mutant BC, even at the stage of endocrine resistance, hat the anti-metabolic activity of PI3K-inhibitors\ncan be visualized using in vivo NMR and exploited to improve treatment outcomes in combination with anti-\nneoplastic agents. In the first aim we will introduce a mutant form of aldolase to determine the contribution of\nthe PI3K-aldolase axis to PI3Ki-efficacy in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. In the second aim we will determine\nin vivo if the metabolic changes induced by PI3K-inhibition are predictive of cancer treatment responses. We\nwill visualize lower glycolysis directly in tumors in vivo using NMR detection of 13C[1]-pyruvate\nmetabolism and compare the predictive value of NMR with that of 18FDG-PET CT. Simultaneous studies of the\nflux of 13C-glucose and 13C[1]-pyruvate will be used to pinpoint mechanisms of resistance. In a third aim, we\nwill develop treatment combinations that may improve the outcomes for women with metastatic BC. Given the\nvulnerability of BC cells in the early post-mitotic phase, we propose to explore PI3K-inhibition following\ninfusion of taxanes or vinca alkaloids in mouse models of PIK3CA-mutant endocrine-resistant BC. Separately,\nwe will explore if the concept of the PI3Ki/Parpi-combination that is currently in clinical trials in TNBC, can be\npromising in advanced PIK3CA-mutant BC.\n 	Address;Adopted;Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;Aldehyde-Lyases;Aldolase A;Antineoplastic Agents;Avidity;Binding;Breast Cancer Cell;Cell Line;Cell division;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Cytoskeleton;Data;Detection;Disease;Drops;Endocrine;Enzymes;Estrogen Receptor Status;Estrogen Receptors;Estrogen receptor positive;G2/M Arrest;Glucose;Glycolysis;Goals;In Vitro;Infusion procedures;Lead;Link;Mammary Neoplasms;Metabolic;Metastatic breast cancer;Mitotic;Modernization;Mutate;Mutation;PIK3CA gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pentosephosphate Pathway;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Positron-Emission Tomography;Predictive Value;Predictive Value of Tests;Protein Isoforms;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Pyruvate;Pyruvate Metabolism Pathway;Receptor Inhibition;Receptor Signaling;Refractory;Resistance;Role;Schedule;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Time;Translating;Treatment outcome;Vinca Alkaloids;Warburg Effect;Woman;Work;arm;cancer cell;cancer therapy;carbohydrate metabolism;chemotherapy;comparative;fluorodeoxyglucose;glucose metabolism;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;mTOR inhibition;malignant breast neoplasm;metabolic imaging;mouse model;mutant;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;nucleotide metabolism;palliative chemotherapy;predictive marker;receptor sensitivity;recruit;resistance mechanism;response;standard of care;taxane;treatment response;treatment strategy;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor metabolism	BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER	BOSTON	MA	UNITED STATES	GERBURG M WULF	DCTD	WEIWEI  Chen	400313	$250k to $499k	400313	1-Mar-2018	1-Mar-2018	28-Feb-2023	PA-16-160	Moonshot

Current therapeutic strategies for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) include\nandrogen receptor (AR) antagonists and a CYP17A1 inhibitor that prevents synthesis of androgens. Although\nthese drugs extend the progression-free survival, approximately 30% of the tumors do not respond to these\ntherapies and the remaining develops resistance shortly after treatment initiation. One of the primary reasons for\nCRPC relapse, despite these treatments, is expression of constitutively-active AR splice variants (AR-SV) that\nlack the ligand binding domain (LBD). To overcome this critical barrier, we discovered novel AR antagonists\n(Selective Androgen Receptor Degraders (SARDs)) that bind to the AR-activation function-1 domain (AF-1) in\nthe N terminal domain (NTD) and/or LBD and antagonize and degrade AR and AR-SVs. The SARDs have unique\npharmacologic properties that strongly and selectively antagonize the AR and degrade full length and splice\nvariant AR (independent of LBD) in multiple models. These SARDs inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells and\ntumors that are dependent on AR full length and splice variants for growth.\nThe SARDs we have tested thus far have poor bioavailability and drug-like properties. In order to overcome the\npoor bioavailability and to understand the mechanisms of action, we propose a) to develop novel SARDs that\nwill inhibit and degrade full length and splice variants of the AR and will be orally bioavailable and b) to identify\nmechanisms by which the AR and its splice variants are degraded, resulting in drugs with better efficacy. Under\naim-1 we will synthesize AR antagonists belonging to new generation of SARDs that will degrade the AR, inhibit\nprostate cancer growth, and will be orally bioavailable. We will synthesize and identify orally bioavailable SARDs\nand evaluate those using in vitro and in vivo PCa and CRPC models. These studies will result in highly potent\nnew SARDs that will have drug-like properties. Under aim-2, we will identify the role of ubiquitination in AR and\nAR-SV degradation by discerning ubiquitin sites and characterizing their role in AR, AR-SV, and SARD action.\nEfforts will be dedicated in aim-3 to determine the scavenging role of SARDs and the implications of GATA-2\ndown-regulation for SARD function. The expected outcome of these studies will be new next generation drugs\nto treat aggressive CRPC, research tools to study AR degradation, better understanding of the AR and CRPC\nbasic biology, and surrogate endpoints to advance these molecules to clinic.

Thus, there is an urgent need for new, improved treatments to eliminate AML cells rapidly\nand completely. Since AML is a highly heterogeneous disease caused by multiple mutations, we propose that\na common, targetable feature among AML cases is that they are directly and indirectly influenced by cytokines\nsecreted in the bone marrow microenvironment. Our long-term goal is to identify novel drug targets to\nselectively eradicate malignant clones that may impact the response to AML therapies. Our immediate goals\nare to comprehensively determine the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory pathways promote clonal\nevolution in AML. We found that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is elevated in a diverse\nset of AML patients, both encourages AML cells to multiply and simultaneously impedes normal cell growth.\nBlocking communication between AML cells and IL-1 inhibits these effects and reduces survival of AML cells\nwhile sparing healthy progenitors. Because cells from a majority of AML patients with different genetic\nsubtypes are dependent on IL-1 signaling for their survival, we predict that a large percentage of AML patients\nmight benefit from drugs targeting this pathway. However, direct targeting of IL-1 signaling may impact cellular\nfunctions in healthy cells. We therefore focused our study on defining the IL-1-mediated molecular differences\nbetween AML and healthy progenitors. Gene expression analysis identified that IL-1 upregulates ASF1B and\nMARCKS in AML compared to healthy progenitors. ASF1B and MARCKS regulate cell proliferation, DNA\ndamage response, and inflammation in AML. Our data shows that genetic and pharmacological targeting of\nASF1B and MARCKS pathways suppresses AML growth. These findings suggest a number of important new\nresearch directions. In the proposed project, we will test the hypothesis that differential activation of ASF1B\nand MARCKS by IL-1β in AML versus healthy progenitors provides a competitive advantage to leukemic cells,\nwhich ultimately leads to AML progression. Specifically, we will determine: (1) the in vitro mechanisms by\nwhich IL-1 activation of ASF1B and MARCKS promotes the growth of AML cells; (2) the roles of ASF1B and\nMARCKS in conferring IL-1-mediated growth advantage and driving AML progression in vivo; and (3) the\nvalidity of ASF1B and MARCKS as therapeutic targets in AML using available small-molecule inhibitors.

project	1R01CA231011-01A1	R01CA231011	9733495	2019	Development of Long non-coding RNA-directed Target Therapy for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer	Grant	Project Summary\n As a deadly disease lacking an FDA-approved targeted therapy, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)\ninvolves a complicated and entangled network of oncogenic processes in which long non-coding RNAs\n(lncRNAs), a novel class of regulatory RNA molecules, may play important roles. The proposed study will\ngenetically exploit lncRNA-regulated cellular networks in TNBC to identify an improved therapeutic strategy. Our\nresearch has illuminated lncRNA involvement in TNBC metastasis and metabolic reprogramming. One\nlncRNA, LINK-A, is upregulated in TNBC and is negatively correlated with breast cancer patient outcomes.\nTissue-specific expression of LINK-A in mouse mammary glands drives tumor development and lung metastasis,\nwhich shares morphological and transcriptional similarity to human TNBC. Furthermore, the expression of LINK-\nA facilities an immunosuppressive environment and profoundly impacts CD9+ T-cell infiltration via lncRNA-\nmediated antigenicity loss. Mechanistically, LINK-A concurrently activates multiple oncogenic signaling\npathways and promotes TRIM71-dependent degradation of the peptide-loading complex, leading to impaired\nantigen presentation. Therefore, LINK-A transgenic mice should serve as a powerful tool for dissecting the\nmolecular complexity of TNBC and assessing precise therapeutic formulations against TNBC. Since most\npathway inhibitors in TNBC clinical trials have been unsuccessful, a lncRNA-directed therapeutic approach, with\nthe appropriate combination of immunotherapy, may optimize the efficacy of therapies for TNBC.\nThe long-term goal of the proposal is to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated antigenicity\nloss and immunosuppression so that improved strategies can be developed to reduce TNBC morbidity and\nmortality. Our central hypothesis is that LINK-A promotes the initiation and immunoresistance of breast cancer,\nwhich can be attenuated in vivo by a combinatorial treatment approach. We will address our hypothesis from\nfollowing aspects: we will first define the underlying molecular mechanism of lncRNA-dependent antigenicity\nloss. We will then restore antigenicity by targeting lncRNA and lncRNA-related signaling events. Finally, we will\nascertain the functional importance of lncRNAs in breast cancer tumorigenesis.\nEmerging evidence of the oncogenic involvement of lncRNAs, as well as their implicated roles in mediating\nimmunosurveillance and immunosuppression, warrants further characterization of TNBC-specific lncRNAs and\nfuture applications that hinge on their activity. Our goal is to demonstrate that LINK-A, as a hallmark of TNBC,\nmay serve as a diagnostic marker that predicts a cancer’s sensitivity to immunotherapy. Thus, a strategy that\ncombines immune checkpoint blockers and lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies has the potential to significantly\nadvance TNBC treatment. In the long run, these research findings will benefit the cancer community by\nintroducing the robust clinical effects of targeting lncRNAs and a well-defined means of stratifying patients based\non these oncogenic lncRNAs.

project	1R01CA241148-01A1	R01CA241148	9973328	2020	Targeting Aldehyde Dehydrogenase for Cancer Prevention	Grant	ABSTRACT:\nIn cancer, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme activity is high in dendritic cells and regulatory T-cells,\nhypothesized to modulate the immune response and also in cancer stem cells (CSCs) to aid the development of\nrecurrent resistant disease. It is therefore surprising that drugs targeting ALDH have not been developed to\nmodulate these processes in cancer. To investigate this issue, we tested the efficacy of existing isoform-specific\nand broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitors on cultured cells and found that none were very effective at modulating cell\nsurvival. Furthermore, we predicted that a broad-spectrum inhibitor would be needed due to the overlapping\nfunctions of the ALDH family members. These observations provided the rationale to develop a non-toxic broad-\nspectrum ALDH inhibitor, which would kill ALDH+ CSCs to prevent recurrent resistant disease, and improve\nimmunotherapy of melanoma. Thus, the central hypothesis is that a non-toxic ALDH inhibitor can be developed\nto reduce recurrent resistant disease development mediated by ALDH+ CSCs and improve the efficacy of\nexisting immunotherapies by reducing immune suppression. Preliminary data show development of a potent\nnon-toxic ALDH inhibitor built on the backbone of the Isatin natural product. This agent eliminates CSCs with\nhigh ALDH activity, preventing increases in ALDH+ cells typically seen with traditional drug treatments. Finally,\nthe inhibitor improves the preclinical efficacy of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model\nwhere this approach alone is not effective. Based on these hypothesis-supporting preliminary data, the following\nSpecific Aims are proposed. First, determine how effectively a non-toxic broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitor\neliminates the melanoma ALDH+ CSC population that expands when treating with traditional chemotherapy.\nFurthermore, determine its potency when combined with traditional chemotherapy to prevent recurrent resistant\ndisease development. This will be achieved by isolating ALDH+ and ALDH- cell populations from cell lines and\npatient derived (PDX) tumors and determining inhibitor efficacy for preventing recurrent resistant disease\ndevelopment when provided in combination with current clinically relevant chemotherapy. Finally, the\nmechanistic basis for inhibition of resistance by the agent combination will be identified. Second, determine the\nefficacy of a non-toxic broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitor on immune regulatory and effector cells in the tumor\nmicroenvironment, alone and when combined with anti-PD1 antibody immunotherapy. Specific targeting of\nALDH in melanoma tumor cells and in host cells on therapeutic efficacy will be tested. Mechanisms leading to\nenhanced immune response will be identified by defining the impact of the inhibitor and antibody combinations\non immune cell composition and function within the tumors, assessing the relative ALDH levels in the immune\ncell populations, and using transient and genetic approaches to target the modulating immune cells. These\nsignificant discoveries would demonstrate the efficacy of targeting ALDH enzymes in cancer for modulating\nresistance and immune cell function, providing needed preclinical validation necessary for clinical translation.

Here we will focus on the RB-tumor suppressor pathway as\na central node controlling proliferation downstream of multiple pathways of relevance to therapy of ER+ breast\ncancer (e.g. endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors). While RB is required for the effective cytostatic\nresponse to a range of targeted therapies employed in ER+ breast cancer, multiple pathways can contribute to\n“cell cycle plasticity” and therefore represent distinct means for generating therapeutic resistance. Here we will\ndelineate the processes underlying this form of resistance, means to elicit durable cell cycle arrest, and\napproaches to target resistance as observed clinically (Aim 1). Our data and newly published studies indicate\nthat RB loss occurs in ER+ breast cancer as a means to escape from cytostatic therapies. Analysis of the RB\nlocus in ER+ breast cancer indicates loss of one copy of 13q occurs in a significant fraction of ER+ breast\ncancers, suggesting that such tumors are primed for RB loss. How to subsequently treat tumors that are\nheterogeneous for RB or are solely RB deficient represents a significant challenge. Using drug screening and\norganoid approaches we have defined several regimens that are particularly effective against RB-negative\ntumors and could represent a general means to target ER+ tumors that progress on CDK4/6 inhibitors (Aim 2).\nTogether these aims will interrogate means to further leverage the RB tumor suppressor for a precision\napproach to the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.	13q;Adjuvant Chemotherapy;Affect;Aromatase Inhibitors;Biological;Breast Cancer Model;Breast Cancer Patient;Breast Cancer Treatment;Bypass;CDK2 gene;CDK4 gene;Cell Cycle;Cell Cycle Arrest;Cell Cycle Deregulation;Cell Cycle Progression;Cell Cycle Regulation;Cell model;Cessation of life;Clinic;Clinical;Complex;Critical Pathways;Cytostatics;Data;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Screening;Drug usage;Estrogen Antagonists;Estrogen Receptor Status;Estrogen Receptors;Estrogen Therapy;Estrogen receptor positive;Estrogens;Event;Evolution;Fulvestrant;Gene Dosage;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Targeting;Genetic;Goals;Hormonal;Intervention;Malignant Neoplasms;Metastatic breast cancer;Modeling;Molecular Target;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organoids;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Publishing;Recurrence;Regimen;Regulatory Pathway;Relapse;Resistance;Risk;Sampling;Seminal;Signal Pathway;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;United States;Woman;Work;base;de novo mutation;genetic evolution;genetic selection;hormone therapy;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant breast neoplasm;next generation;personalized approach;pressure;prognostic;programs;public health relevance;receptor function;response;targeted agent;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;treatment response;tumor;tumor heterogeneity	ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP	BUFFALO	NY	UNITED STATES	Erik  Knudsen,Agnieszka  Witkiewicz	DCTD	SHARAD KUMAR Verma	429531	$250k to $499k	429531	28-Feb-2020	1-Mar-2020	28-Feb-2025	PA-19-056	Moonshot
project	1R01CA248310-01	R01CA248310	9944762	2020	Development of a first-in-class mEGFR dimerization inhibitor	Grant	Background: Lung cancers are often driven by mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (mtEGFR). While\nEGFR tyrosine kinase activity inhibitors (TKI) have shown effectiveness, within 9-13 months all patients\ndevelop resistance including to 3rd generation TKI - Osimertinib. These patients do not have any approved\ntherapy options, therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a novel agent that functions independently of\nkinase function. DGD1202, a first-in-class, novel, orally bioavailable, small molecule that inhibits EGFR\ndimerization, induces degradation of EGFR and selectively kills TKI resistant NSCLC tumors.\nObjective: We and others have shown that the degradation of mutant EGFR protein has a profound effect on\ncancer cell survival. Thus, we hypothesized that a drug which induces degradation of mtEGFR independent of\nthe ATP binding domain will result in selective activity. Our objective is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of\nDGD1202 in a panel of lung cancer cells lines, xenografts, and PDXs derived from lung cancer patients\ncontaining mtEGFR who have undergone treatment with a TKI.\nSpecific Aims: We propose to evaluate the specificity and potency of DGD1202 against TKI-resistant lung\ncancer cells and xenografts. Aim 1 is to determine the in vitro efficacy of DGD1202 against a panel of EGFR\ndriven, including osimertinib-resistant, cancer cell lines relative to normal cells. Aim 2 is to conduct in vivo\npharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses to assess drug exposure and determine the effect\non the target. Aim 3 is to determine the overall therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety of DGD1202 in vivo.\nWe hypothesize that treatment with DGD1202 will induce EGFR degradation preferentially in tumor cells driven\nby mtEGFR and that EGFR degradation will correlate with the overall response.\nStudy Design: We will screen DGD1202 alongside osimertinib in a series of lung cancer lines. The resulting\nresponse will be then correlated with effect on EGFR degradation. We also propose to determine in vivo PK\nand PD studies both with a single and with fractionated dosing to determine the optimum bioavailability. Using\nthe optimized dose and schedule, we will assess effects on EGFR protein against a panel mtEGFR-driven and\nosimertinib resistant lung cancer xenograft and PDX models. The long-term safety will be assessed in immune\ncompetent mice. Standard statistical models will be used to compare the response to treatment and how it\ncorrelates with effects on EGFR.\nImpact: We anticipate that our approach will open a new way to target EGFR and, more broadly, to develop\ntherapeutics to selectively target mutated proteins to degradation. The knowledge gained from in vivo tumor\nmodels will provide a rationale for the use of this class of molecules in future clinical studies.

The majority of these patients will enter into a prolonged post-treatment survivorship\nphase of care. However, we are currently facing unprecedented challenges in survivorship care delivery.\nSerious gaps in the care of survivors have been identified, including underuse of guideline-recommended\ncancer surveillance services, such as annual mammography for breast cancer survivors and colonoscopy for\ncolorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, and underuse of recommended preventive care services such as\nvaccinations, lipid testing and cardiovascular risk management, and disease screenings. Compounding these\nissues, our current oncology workforce is insufficient to care for the rapidly growing population of survivors.\nPrimary care provider (PCP)-led survivorship care is a feasible model of survivorship care. In observational\nstudies, survivors who receive care that involves PCPs received higher quality of care; international\nrandomized trials comparing PCP-led to oncology-led survivorship care have shown no significant differences\nin time to detection of cancer recurrence or quality of life for early-stage survivors. However, there is a paucity\nof high-quality research on models of survivorship care in the U.S, particularly in community-based settings,\nseriously limiting our ability to provide high-quality cancer survivorship care. To address these issues, we will\nconduct a prospective cluster randomized trial of two models of cancer survivorship care in early-stage, low-\nrisk breast cancer and CRC survivors cared for in a community-based, integrated health care setting. Building\non our pilot work and drawing on the empirical literature, we will test the efficacy of an embedded PCP model\n(experimental condition) in which PCPs are embedded within an oncology practice and will care for low-risk\nsurvivors who will be transitioned at 12 months post-treatment. These PCPs will be given training in cancer\nsurvivorship care focused on cancer surveillance and chronic disease prevention. This model will be compared\nto the extant oncology physician model (usual care) that is the default condition in this healthcare system. The\nprimary outcome will be receipt of guideline-recommended care (e.g., cancer surveillance, preventive care),\nassessed over a 36-month period. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated\nmeasures of patient-provider communication, care coordination, quality of life, self-efficacy in managing care,\nand other measures. We will also compare utilization of unplanned care (hospitalizations, urgent care) and\nreceipt of non-recommended care. We will explore PCP perceptions of confidence in delivery of survivorship\ncare. We will conduct this trial in 8 large, hospital-based medical centers of an integrated health care system,\nKaiser Permanente Southern California, with approximately 2,000 early-stage breast and CRC survivors. Our\nresults will provide more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of a scalable model of PCP-led survivorship\ncare, addressing the critical shortage of oncology providers while maintaining or improving quality.

However, HCT-related factors, such as total body irradiation used for conditioning,\ngraft-versus-host disease, and prolonged exposure to immunosuppressive therapy, result in very high risk for\nsubsequent skin cancers. Compared with the general population, HCT survivors are also more likely to develop\nskin cancers at a younger age, have advanced disease at presentation, and experience multiple recurrences.\nDespite this high burden, less than 20% of long-term HCT survivors report being examined for skin cancer, even\nthough >90% were seen by their primary care physician (PCPs) in the prior year. In HCT survivors, skin cancers\ndevelop at a time when their follow-up care has largely transitioned from oncology care to the primary care\nsetting, emphasizing the need to develop innovative strategies that 1) provide HCT survivors with the skills to\nconduct effective skin self-examinations, and prompt action from their providers when worrisome lesions are\nfound; 2) engage PCPs in HCT risk-based screening for skin cancer; and 3) ensure rapid access to dermatologic\nexams. Advances in technology, including widespread availability of cell phones and teledermoscopy (remote\nexpert assessment of a photographed lesion) offer promising opportunities to improve early detection and\ntreatment of skin cancer. We propose a comparative effectiveness study that will examine the impact of patient\nactivation and education (PAE), alone or in combination with physician-tailored strategies, on clinically\nmeaningful behavioral outcomes. We will enroll 720 HCT survivors at a large, diverse HCT center to:\n1) Determine the impact of PAE alone or with physician activation (PAE+Phys) on skin cancer screening and\nprevention practices at 12 months; and 2) Among PCPs of HCT survivors, determine the impact of a\nteledermoscopy e-learning program compared with provision of print materials for identifying suspect lesions.\nWe hypothesize that compared to PAE, patients randomized to PAE+Phys will report higher rates of thorough\nself- and provider skin exam, shorter time to referral of suspicious lesions, and improved quality of life; compared\nto print materials alone, physicians randomized to teledermoscopy e-learning will have greater recognition of\nsuspect lesions and more appropriate, cost-effective referral patterns. Our multi-disciplinary team will: 1)\nestablish the efficacy of PAE, and the relative benefit of physician activation; 2) inform the practice of skin cancer\nscreening using innovative mobile strategies that are readily applicable in the clinical setting; and 3) identify\nfacilitators of and barriers to appropriate delivery of survivorship-focused preventive care for long-term HCT\nsurvivors. Information obtained from the current study can be used to develop strategies for management of\nother late effects (e.g. cardiovascular, endocrine) in HCT survivors in the primary care setting, and to improve\nskin cancer screening in other high-risk (e.g. radiation-exposed) cancer survivor populations.

project	1R01CA249467-01	R01CA249467	9967391	2020	Optimizing Functional Outcomes of Older Survivors After Chemotherapy	Grant	Project Summary:\nThe overarching goal of this proposal, submitted in response to RFA-CA-19-035, is to evaluate if an aging-\nsensitive survivorship intervention improves outcomes valued by older adults and their caregivers\nduring the transition into survivorship from curative-intent chemotherapy. This proposal is important\nbecause by 2040, 73% of survivors will be aged 65+ and almost 50% will be aged 75+. Unfortunately, aging-\nrelated conditions (e.g., physical and cognitive function impairments) are not addressed routinely in survivorship\ncare. Preliminary research by all multiple principal investigators (MPIs: Mohile, Janelsins, Mustian) suggests that\na Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) intervention is effective for surveilling, triaging and managing\nphysical and cognitive impairments, improving patient and caregiver satisfaction, and fostering communication\nabout aging-related conditions during chemotherapy in older cancer patients and their caregivers. Preliminary\nresearch by MPIs also suggests that a Survivorship Health Promotion program is effective for improving physical\nfunction among older survivors after chemotherapy. Our MPI team has shown that GEM and Survivorship Health\nPromotion are feasible to implement in older patients, survivors and caregivers in nationwide samples recruited\nvia the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP)\nResearch Base network. To fill existing empirical gaps in survivorship care for older survivors and caregivers,\nwe created a novel intervention called Survivorship-GEM by combining these two very promising and synergistic\nprograms. Survivorship-GEM is directed by oncology advanced practice providers (APPs), because they\nroutinely direct care for survivors in the community. We propose to conduct a two-arm cluster randomized trial\ncomparing the efficacy of our novel Survivorship-GEM intervention to usual care for improving physical and\ncognitive function, satisfaction with care, completion of referral appointments, and hospitalizations among older\nsurvivors. We will also examine the effect of Survivorship-GEM on oncology APP communication with primary\ncare providers and on caregiver distress and satisfaction with care. We will randomize 30 NCORP community\noncology practices to two arms: 1) Survivorship-GEM or 2) usual care. Survivors aged 65+ (n=720) and\ncaregivers (if available, estimated n=500) will complete baseline assessments at the end of curative-intent\nchemotherapy for a solid tumor malignancy with follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Our uniquely qualified,\nmultidisciplinary team includes expertise in geriatrics, clinical trials, nursing, primary care, behavioral oncology,\nrehabilitation, health disparities, biostatistics, and implementation science. The team also benefits from\ncollaborations with the Cancer and Aging Research Group Advisory Board and the SCOREboard patient\nadvocate group. The APP-directed Survivorship-GEM intervention is highly innovative and has tremendous\npotential to improve outcomes in older survivors and caregivers by surveilling, triaging and managing the effects\nof chemotherapy and by fostering health promotion.

project	1R01CA249501-01	R01CA249501	9967767	2020	Self-Management to Optimize Survivorship Care and Outcomes in Lung and Colorectal Cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe overarching goal of this five-year grant proposal, submitted on behalf of the Beckman Research Institute of\nCity of Hope and the University of California, Riverside, in response to RFA-CA-19-035, is to test the efficacy\nof an advance-practice nurse (APRN)-driven telehealth Survivor Self-Management (SSM) Intervention in 414\nlung and colorectal cancer survivors. This research is critical because lung and colorectal cancer survivors\nhave high post-treatment needs, are older, and suffers from greater co-morbidities and poor quality of life\n(QOL). Lung and colorectal cancer survivors remain underrepresented in research, leading to significant\ndisparities in post-treatment outcomes. Based on the Chronic Care Self-Management Model (CCM), the SSM\nIntervention includes the following components: 1) care coordination and communication between oncology\nand primary care on surveillance/follow-up, health promotion, disease prevention, and comorbidity\nmanagement; 2) provision of clinician care plan to PCPs; 3) comprehensive patient/geriatric assessment for\nsurvivors of all ages; 4) personalized care plan for survivors; and 5) survivor self-management skills building\nfor surveillance/follow-up, late and long-term effects of treatments, comorbidities, and healthy living. It is\nadministered in five telehealth sessions (Zoom videoconferencing) and three subsequent maintenance\ntelehealth sessions for survivors who are four months post-treatment. We will test the efficacy of the SSM\nIntervention using a randomized design of attention control arm versus an intervention arm to pursue the\nfollowing specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (Primary): Determine the efficacy of the intervention on care\ncoordination, communication, and provider knowledge at 4 months post-accrual; Specific Aim 2 (Primary):\nDetermine the efficacy of the intervention on survivor outcomes at 4 months post-accrual; and Specific Aim 3\n(Exploratory): Assess the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the\nintervention. The RE-AIM Framework informs intervention delivery process, which will set the stage for future\nlarge scale implementation for sustainability in real-world care settings. This proposal is innovative because it\naddresses a critical need to improve care delivery and outcomes for high needs, understudied survivorship\npopulations (lung, colorectal, older survivors), and the telehealth approach promotes scalability. The\ninterdisciplinary team, which includes expertise in nursing science (Sun, Reb, Ferrell), oncology (Fakih), and\nprimary care (Kim) is uniquely suited to conduct this research. The proposal is significant, with high scientific\nrigor and outcomes that are of critical importance to survivors, clinicians, healthcare systems, the National\nCancer Institute, and the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM. The research will address a critical gap in\nknowledge of how self-management interventions improve care delivery and outcomes during post-treatment\ntransitions to follow-up care.

project	1R01CA249568-01	R01CA249568	9968717	2020	Onco-primary care networking to support TEAM-based care - the ONE TEAM Study	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nSince the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released the seminal report, From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor:\nLost in Transition 13 years ago, there has been substantial progress in understanding the health issues\naffecting cancer survivors, yet little has changed regarding survivorship care delivery. There remains a\ndisconnect between primary care providers and oncology care teams that has led to persistent problems\nimplementing risk-stratified survivorship care for cancer survivors.\nWith advances in cancer therapy and improved survival rates, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease\n(CVD) now exceeds that of the cancer for many survivors. While cancer therapy may contribute to this risk, it is\ngenerally a compilation of non-modifiable factors (i.e., genetics, aging), as well as modifiable lifestyle behaviors\n(i.e., diet, exercise) that lead to both the cancer and to cardiovascular disease (CVD). With the lack of primary\ncare provider (PCP) integration in the cancer care team and time constraints and difficulty keeping up with\nrapidly evolving non-cancer therapeutics for medical oncologists, there is an inferred lower priority for\ncomorbidity management.\nWe will determine the effectiveness of the multi-level iGuide intervention and the up-titrated iGuide2\nintervention compared with usual care on the primary outcomes. The theory-driven, self-guided iGuide\nintervention consists of patient-level components (video vignettes, patient-facing webinars) and PCP-level\ncomponents (electronic health record [EHR] automated cancer specialist-PCP letter, tele-education series, and\nautomated reminders). The up-titrated iGuide2 intervention consists of tailored patient-level video vignettes\nand targeted EHR specialist-PCP communication.\nThe primary outcomes of the ONE TEAM SMART-design study are (1) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and\nInformation Set (HEDIS) quality measures of management of the three CVD comorbidities (hypertension, type\n2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia) based upon laboratory and clinical measurement; (2) medication\nadherence assessed pharmacy refill data using Proportion of Days Covered (PDC); and (3) patient-provider\ncommunication (Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care). Secondary aims include exploring\nmoderating and mediating factors in each level of the intervention, support of patient-centered outcomes,\nhealth care use, measures of provider activation, and costs of care resulting from the multi-level intervention.\nThe overarching goal of this proposed project is to optimize the management and outcomes of individuals with\ncancer, both during and after treatment, and to develop a ‘low-touch’ multi-level intervention that can be\ngeneralized, adapted and scaled in other health care systems. The proposed ONE TEAM study brings together\na multi-disciplinary research team with the necessary expertise and experience in survivorship research,\npopulation and behavioral science, primary care, oncology, and biostatistics. Results from this intervention will\nhave important implications in the advancement of healthcare delivery for cancer survivors.

In some cases, the primary tumor is too small to be detected,\nwith enlarged nodes being the only manifestation of HNSCC. These unknown primary cancers\n(UPCs), often induced by human papilloma virus (HPV), usually arise in the mucosa of Waldeyer's\nring, the lymphatic tonsillar tissues of the pharynx. Finding UPC is significant and impactful\naddressing an unmet need with long term oncologic and functional outcomes improved by locating\nand removing UPC. However, their detection is impaired by the corrugated, cryptic surface, and\nnodularity of lymphatic tissue which decreases the sensitivity of physical examination while the\nvascularity and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity of the lymphoid tissue obscure small tumors by\ncomputerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET).\n We have invented a library of ultra pH sensitive (UPS) nanoprobes, covalently conjugated to\nindocyanine green (ICG) that respond to acidic tumor microenvironment, with a concomitant sharp\nchange in their fluorescence state from OFF to ON. One such nanoprobe, ONM-100, has been\ndeveloped and studied in a Phase 1 and ongoing FDA approved Phase 2 clinical trial. it has been\nshown to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events, compatible with surgical endoscopes,\nand able to detect a variety of cancers including HNSCC in real time. Based on these data we\nhypothesize that ONM-100 used as an adjunct to SOC panendoscopy can improve detection of\nUPC. To test our hypothesis, we will (1) Compare the sensitivity and specificity of activatable\nprobe ONM-100 for cancer detection to always ON probes for tumors in Waldeyer's ring; (2)\nDetect HPV-mediated HNSCC in patients after systemic administration of ONM-100 comparing\nfluorescence to true-positive cancers; (3) Detect UPC in patients after systemic administration of\nONM-100. Successful execution of this project will provide precise excision of UPC and avoidance\nof intense adjuvant therapy for UPC patients significantly improving care and outcomes for these\npatients who suffer greatly from less oncologically effective imprecise overtreatment.

project	1R01CA266234-01	R01CA266234	10349208	2022	Translating phospholipase activatable fluorophores for the sensitive detection of non-small cell lung cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nThis application proposes to translate activatable fluorophores targeted to cytosolic phospholipase A2α\n(cPLA2α) for intraoperative surgical detection in lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cancer-related cause\nof death and the third most diagnosed cancer in the United States. Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC),\nrepresent 90% of lung cancers, and surgical resection continues to be the most effective approach to cure\npatients with low stage premetastatic disease. Surgeons typically use visual inspection and finger palpation to\ndefine solid tumor margins. However, this approach is often insufficient to detect residual disease, leading to\nrecurrence in up to 40% of patients and significantly reduced 5-year survival.\nImproving intraoperative detection of tumor margins is imperative, because small foci of residual disease at or\nclose to the resection margins are the most common cause of local recurrence. The most important prognostic\nindicator following cancer surgery is complete resection, which prolongs patient survival and improves post-\nsurgical quality of life. Contrast enhancement of tumors using near-infrared (NIR) imaging with targeted\nfluorophores can identify small lesions that are not detectable by visual observation or palpation. NIR imaging\noffers high resolution and sensitivity and can be performed in real-time during surgery.\nIn this application, we propose to translate DDAO-arachidonate (DDAO-A), an activatable probe designed to\nspecifically target cPLA2α, a critical signaling enzyme upregulated early in tumorigenesis and overexpressed\nin more than 47% of NSCLC. Preliminary Studies indicate that DDAO-A is selectively activated by murine and\nhuman NSCLC tumors, and can detect small foci in both mouse models and excised human lung tumor tissue.\nDDAO-A will be synthesized under GLP conditions and dispersed in clinically approved liposomal formulations\nfor delivery. Selected mouse studies will be performed to confirm probe activation, tumor targeting and the\nability to detect tumor margins. Systemic toxicity will be evaluated in mice and in a small cohort of canines. We\nwill utilize an established platform for clinical translation of NIR fluorophores, employing a canine clinical trial\nfor intraoperative surgery. We will recruit a patient cohort of 30 companion animals with spontaneous NSCLC\npresenting to our Veterinary School.\nDDAO-A will be used for detection of primary tumors and identification of tumor margins during intraoperative\nfluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) in canine patients. We will investigate both systemic injection and topical\napplication for detection of residual tumor. These data will be compared to control surgical cohorts using the\nnon-targeted indocyanine green (ICG) or without NIR fluorescence guidance. If successful, this study will\nimprove surgical outcomes by improving localization of small tumor deposits in the lung, lymph nodes and\nmargins. The completion of these studies will form the basis for an investigational new drug (IND) application\nin support of a clinical trial to assess DDAO-A-guided surgery in human lung cancer patients.

project	1R21CA215968-01	R21CA215968	9305413	2017	Investigating developmental Hox programs as determinants of sarcomagenesis	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nHijacking of normal developmental programs is a common mechanism of tumorigenesis and deregulation\nof developmental HOX programs, in particular, contributes to the pathogenesis of leukemia, as well as\nsome solid tumors. We recently discovered that HOX gene expression is highly deregulated in Ewing\nsarcoma, an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor that has a peak incidence in adolescence. Specifically,\nthe posterior HOX genes, HOXD10, HOXD11 and HOXD13, are over-expressed compared to other\nnormal and malignant tissues, and down-regulation of HOXD13 in Ewing sarcoma cell lines results in a\ndramatic decrease in tumorigenicity. The expression of all Hox genes normally becomes restricted to\ndistinct regions of the developing musculoskeletal (MSK) system during embryonic development, with the\nposterior genes becoming restricted to the lumbosacral vertebrae, pelvis and developing forelimb and\nhindlimb – the dominant sites of Ewing sarcoma presentation clinically. Recent work from the Wellik\nlaboratory has shown that Hox-expressing cells arise as mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells (MSCs)\nduring embryonic development and persist as regionally-restricted MSCs through postnatal and adult\nstages. MSCs have been implicated as putative cells of origin for Ewing sarcoma, but the precise identity\nof the target cells, the molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation and a clear explanation of the\nregion-specific etiology of this tumor type remain poorly understood. Important for this application, the\nLawlor lab has shown that ectopic expression of the Ewing sarcoma driver oncogene, EWS/FLI1, in bulk\npopulations of MSCs initiates tumorigenesis and disrupts HOX gene expression as a result of epigenetic\nderegulation. These two key findings lead us to the novel hypothesis that EWS/FLI1-dependent disruption\nof the posterior HOX program in MSCs where these genes are developmentally and regionally expressed\n(i.e. the posterior skeleton) is central to Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis. We will determine the efficiency\nand latency of EWS/FLI1-induced tumor formation in Hox-expressing MSCs that are isolated from different\nanatomic sites and test the hypothesis that oncogenic transformation occurs more readily in MSC\npopulations where restricted, posterior Hox gene expression has been established. We will use\nHoxa11eGFP reporter mice to monitor ectopic induction of the posterior Hox program in transduced cells\nand their resultant tumors. Use of MSCs from control and Hox mutant mouse lines will allow us to\ndetermine if posterior Hox genes are functionally required for the transformation process in vivo as our in\nvitro data suggest. With the biochemical, molecular and in vivo genetic tools the two labs have developed,\nsuccessful demonstration of this novel hypothesis during this funding period will provide the basis for\nfuture highly impactful and mechanistic dissection of the etiology of Ewing's sarcoma, including a\nmolecular basis for understanding the regional specificity of this tumor in vivo.

Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:\nMolecular profiling – the practice of molecularly testing tumors in order to find specific gene or protein\nalterations which can be used to recommend targeted therapies – is increasingly used in oncology and is fast\nbecoming a major part of precision medicine. In practice, each patient or physician generally receives a list of\nmolecular anomalies and a list of therapies which are predicted to be beneficial or not beneficial based on the\ntumor molecular profile. This may lead to a difficult process of prioritizing therapies for individual patients. In\nthe current proposal, we will develop computational network-based approaches to therapy recommendation by\nusing existing resources to inform the connections between drugs and gene or protein variants. We will\nconsider approaches both for creating “average” networks based on population-level data and for creating\n“patient-specific” networks based on an individual’s specific tumor profile. We will also design and implement\nan interactive data visualization approach for these networks which will be usable by both clinical researchers\nand clinicians. The methods and tools developed as part of this project will be entirely reproducible and shared\nwith the community via open-source software packages and interactive tools. We believe our project could\neventually lead the way to improving the way therapies are targeted to cancer patients.

Making sure that the submitted material actually contains tumor, in sufficient\nquantity, is not always easy, and sometimes just preparing conventional microscope slides can consume most\nor even the entire specimen. We have developed a new, simple and inexpensive approach we term MUSE, for\nMicroscopy with UV Surface Excitation, that can provide high-resolution images directly and quickly from fresh\ntissue without consuming it, and thus can preserve intact, high-quality specimens for biobanking, downstream\nmolecular and functional analyses.\n MUSE, by ensuring that acquired small biopsy specimens are indeed fit for purpose, can avoid the\nneed to have a patient return at a later date for additional biopsies. In addition, the method will allow for lesion\ndetection over larger cross-sections of tissue, such as organ whole-mounts, not currently practical with\nconventional instrumentation. Finally, we expect that MUSE will yield additional biologically informative imaging\nby avoiding artifacts inherent in conventional tissue processing and sectioning. We focus here on facilitation of\ntissue-based molecular studies, viable tumor harvest for xenografts and cultured spheroids, and biobanking,\nand include crucial validation studies to ensure that the MUSE process does not compromise sample utility due\nto possible impacts from exposure to intercalating dyes and/or UV light.\n MUSE relies on two mechanisms: 1) surface-restricted excitation of fluorescent dyes due to micron-\nscale penetration of sub-300-nm ultraviolet light; and 2) the fact that many conventional dyes excited in this\nway emit visible light. These signals are bright enough to be detected by conventional color cameras using\nsub-second exposure times, allowing rapid imaging of large areas.\n MUSE eliminates any requirement for conventional histology processing with formalin fixation, paraffin\nembedding, or thin-sectioning. It requires no lasers, confocal, multiphoton or optical coherence tomography\ninstrumentation, can eventually cost in the range of a few thousands of dollars, and therefore affordable at the\npoint of care (point of biopsy). MUSE samples are stained within seconds using familiar histology stains, such\nas eosin and DAPI, and the resulting high-resolution images converted from fluorescence to H&E-like\nbrightfield appearance for interpretation in real time (but with novel and potentially useful features) easily\ninterpreted by pathologists.\n While rapid cellular-scale imaging of fresh tissue can have significant benefits in clinical arenas, it can\nalso empower basic and translational research use for essentially instant histology-, pathology- or\ntoxicology-relevant images directly from experimental animal models—at the bench—and may help relieve\nsuch investigators from having to rely on often overworked, sometimes unavailable, conventional histology and\npathology services.

Despite the introduction of a number of novel treatments MM\npatients still are confronted with an average survival time of 5-7 years. Emerging evidence suggests\nthat the endosteal niche at the bone-BM interface fosters the survival of drug-resistant MM cells,\nespecially through adhesive interactions with osteoblasts, and is therefore responsible for relapse.\nCurrently, treatment options for MM patients are evaluated mainly on the basis of clinical features and\nhistorical population response rates. Therefore, an important unmet clinical need is to develop the\nability to select the best therapy for an individual based on the ex vivo response of the patient's MM\ncells (PMMCs) to drug treatment options. This precision medicine approach is expected to provide a\ntransformative means of: (1) reducing ineffective therapies, (2) minimizing excess toxicity and cost,\n(3) inhibiting the development of the tumor cells' cross-resistance to additional drugs as a critical part\nof the long-term care of MM patients, and (4) assessing the probability of relapse occurrence. A\nmajor challenge, however, is the lack of clinically relevant, high-throughput and inexpensive models\nthat preserve primary patient biospecimen for downstream analyses and use. The goal of this R33\nproject is to improve and validate a multiple myeloma (MM) culture platform, which was developed\nthrough the prior R21 award to enable the ex vivo preservation of PMMCs derived from BM\nbiospecimens. The specific aims of the project are to: (1) increase the culture platform's high-\nthroughput operation capability by implementing a gravity-driven, pumpless flow control strategy while\npreserving the feasibility of producing the device using industry standard materials and manufacturing\npractice and (2) prospectively correlate the ex vivo chemosensitivity and resistance of PMMCs with\nclinical response as a means of validating the predictive capability of our ex vivo MM culture platform\nand expand drug-resistant PMMCs for downstream characterization as a potential means of guiding\nsubsequent treatment selection. Anticipated results will validate that ex vivo preserved MM\nbiospecimens can be widely used with our culture platform for screening patient-specific treatment\noptions as well as for other applications such as preclinical evaluation of new therapeutics, studying\ndrug-resistant PMMC populations, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and ex vivo models of breast\nand prostate cancers that metastasize to BM and bone.

Unfortunately, there are\nsubstantial gaps in existing capabilities in terms of sensitivity. For example, a minimum of many thousands of\ncells is required for in-depth profiling of proteins in a biological sample. We have recently developed a\nbreakthrough technology, termed nanoPOTS (Nanodroplet Preparation in One pot for Trace Samples) which,\nwhen coupled to ultrasensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), enables effective analysis of\nas few as 10 mammalian cells with a coverage of >3000 identified proteins. We hypothesize that the nanoPOTS\nplatform will be an enabling technology to characterize the molecular underpinnings of tumor heterogeneity by\ncreating 3D proteome maps of human tumors. The overall objective of our study is to extend and validate this\nanalysis platform to enable single-cell resolution measurements at high throughput (>100 samples per day) and\napply the platform to create 3D proteome maps of human tumors. Studies in Aim 1 will focus on optimizing and\nvalidating the ultrasensitive nanoPOTS proteomic workflow to enable robust proteome profiling of ≥3,000 protein\ngroups from single human cells obtained by both flow cytometry and laser capture microdissection (LCM). Aim\n2 will evaluate and compare two complementary technologies for increasing measurement throughput to ~100\ncells/day with minimal impact on proteome coverage. We will determine whether multiplexing through application\nof isobaric labels for pooled analysis, or rapid LC coupled with ultrahigh resolution ion mobility spectrometry-MS\nprovides greatest coverage, quantitation and reproducibility for single cell proteomics at the desired throughput.\nIn Aim 3, we will apply the optimized platform to create in-depth proteome maps for human pancreatic ductal\nadenocarcinomas (PDAs) at single cell resolution. Following initial targeted studies of specific cells of interest\nwithin sectioned tissues, we will use a combination of cryosectioning, LCM and the optimized nanoPOTS\nplatform to analyze single cells within the tumor microenvironment. 3D reconstruction of these in-depth, spatially\nresolved proteomic analyses will provide the first global proteomic tumor maps at single-cell resolution. This\nproject will not only establish an innovative measurement capability that will broadly advance cancer research,\nbut will also provide unique molecular insights into cellular heterogeneity relevant to PDA pathology. The\nresulting platform will be disseminated through a combination of publication and commercialization.

It is now clear that in order to develop effective therapies and predict patient\nresponse we need to better understand these interactions. Biomimetic tissue-engineered\ntechnologies and models hold the promise of incorporating more components into in vitro/ex\nvivo models and, thus, make them more accurately reflect human disease. Here we focus on\nkidney cancer and specifically, on the interactions between cancer cells and the vasculature (i.e.\nendothelial cells) - an interaction that is understudied, yet critical to better understanding,\napplying anti-angiogenic drugs and developing new such therapies. Our proposal describes an\nintegrated approach that increases relevance by enabling physiologically relevant models that\nreplicate structure/function relationships while providing patient specificity. Our approach is\ntransdisciplinary including expertise in oncology (Christos Kyriakopoulos), surgery (Jason Abel),\npathology (Wei Huang), clinical imaging (Steve Cho), biostatistics/clinical analysis (Kyungmann\nKim) and microtechnology/organotypic models (David Beebe). Specifically, we will develop a\nrobust microvessel culture approach (uVESSEL) to create an in vitro/ex vivo model of kidney\ncancer-vascular interactions using the patient's own cells to measure therapy response of\npatient specific uVESSEL model (Aim 1), measure patient response via multiple endpoints (incl.\nPSMA-based PET/CT imaging) (Aim 2), and evaluate predictive value of patient specific\nuVESSEL model (Aim 3). Our approach is bench to bedside and back again taking advantage\nof our teams' location with the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center and access to\npatient samples. Our goal is to push the boundaries between in vitro models and ex vivo\nexperiments by putting the patient's cells into biomimetic models.

Recent clinical and experimental studies addressing this problem require the\narduous collection of pre- and post- treatment data for every new specific treatment and cancer type studied.\nThus, a computational approach that can expedite the identification of molecular determinants of resistance\nvia the analysis of existing large-scale cancer cohorts is called for.\n Our proposal seeks to identify novel ways to counter de novo and acquired resistance through drug\ncombinations. We focus on gene interactions rather than individual genes and leverage large scale genomic\ndatasets and patient response data. Our approach is based on recent work in the Ruppin and other labs\nshowing that genetic interactions can be computationally identified by analyzing omics tumor data.\n To decipher pathways of resistance to cancer therapies, we focus here on studying a new type of genetic\ninteractions, termed synthetic rescues (SRs). SRs denote a functional interaction between two genes whereby a\nfitness reducing change in the activity of one of the two genes (termed the vulnerable gene) is compensated by\naltered activity of another gene (termed the rescuer gene), which restores cell fitness and rescues it. We have\nrecently developed tools for SR data-driven identification from large cancer tumors cohorts, successfully\nenabling the prediction of drug response and emergence of resistance in patients. Building on these\ntransformational results the specific aims of this proposal are:\nSpecific Aim 1. Perform a pan-cancer and cancer type-specific SR-based analyses, focusing on\nmelanoma, breast, head and neck, and colon cancer, identifying the major rescuer genes in each\ncancer type, together with specific recommendations of combinatorial therapies mitigating resistance.\nSpecific Aim 2. Develop a new version of SR analysis tools that will be made publically available\nfor use by others in a standard, user friendly manner and includes analysis of gene methylation and\ngenome wide mutation data, on top of other omics data already utilized in our previous SR inference tools.\nSpecific Aim 3. Experimentally test predicted rescuer targets and combination therapies in\npatient derived resistant cancer cells.\n Taken together the proposed study, will present a transformative SR based approach for identifying and\ntargeting resistance pathways across the whole cancer genome.

project	1R33CA225296-01	R33CA225296	9482979	2017	Advanced Cancer Classification via Single-Cell Electrophoretic Cytopathology	Grant	ABSTRACT\nRecent efforts to identify and circumvent mechanisms of drug resistance point to the role of HER2 truncated\nisoforms, which lack the extracellular domain of the full-length protein targeted by trastuzumab. Understanding\nthe biology of HER2 isoforms is crucial to developing new drugs personalized for individuals resistant to\ntrastuzumab therapy. However, detection of these isoforms in paraffin-embedded tissue sections (FFPE) is\nimpossible by conventional methods (Immunohistochemistry, IHC) due to the lack of isoform-specific antibodies\nand the loss of epitope integrity during tissue processing. To overcome these barriers, the goal of this project\nis to develop a robust tool that will both allow retrospective studies on HER2 isoforms and enable\nisoform screening on a patient-to-patient basis to tailor breast cancer treatment.\nOur efforts fill a major gap in cancer research: the limited ability to scrutinize tissue sections for protein targets\nthat either lack highly specific antibody probes (analytical) or lose epitope integrity during tissue processing (pre-\nanalytical). We introduce a whole-tissue western blot (wtWestern) that creates a novel 3D protein ‘imprint’\nof the tissue section for stable storage and downstream antibody probing. The unique dual-functionality\nwtWestern electrophoretically resolves proteins (extracted from a 2D tissue section) along the depth (z-axis) of\na supporting photoactive hydrogel layer. Exposure to UV light covalently links protein to the hydrogel. We\nbenchmark the fixative-free imprint for biobanking suitability, apply the wtWestern to measurement of proteins\n(including isoforms) in archived frozen or FFPE tissue sections, and maximize tissue utility by enabling detection\nof 20+ proteins for cancer sub-type classification. This innovative wtWestern is expected to maximize the quality\nand utility of biospecimens for downstream analyses – critically important to retrospective studies that form the\nbasis for both cancer diagnostics/prognostics and personalized medicine.\n	Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;Antibodies;Antineoplastic Agents;Archives;Benchmarking;Binding;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;Biometry;Blood Vessels;Breast;Breast Cancer Treatment;Cancer Diagnostics;Cell Communication;Cells;Cellular Morphology;Classification;Classification Scheme;Clinical;Complex;Cytometry;Cytopathology;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnostic;Drug resistance;ERBB2 gene;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epitopes;Exposure to;Extracellular Domain;Extracellular Matrix;Fixatives;Formalin;Freezing;Goals;Heterogeneity;Histology;Human;Hydrogels;Image;Immune;Immunohistochemistry;Individual;Laboratories;Length;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Mesenchymal;Methods;Microfluidics;Molecular;Morphology;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncoproteins;Paraffin Embedding;Pathology;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical shape;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Precision therapeutics;Progression-Free Survivals;Protein Isoforms;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Proteins;Resistance;Resolution;Retrospective Studies;Role;Selection for Treatments;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Slice;Statistical Methods;Stromal Cells;Taxonomy;Technology;Temperature;Tissue Embedding;Tissue Sample;Tissues;Trastuzumab;Ultraviolet Rays;Variant;Western Blotting;Woman;anticancer research;base;biobank;cancer classification;cancer subtypes;cancer therapy;clinical Diagnosis;commercialization;design;extracellular;humanized monoclonal antibodies;imprint;improved;innovation;insight;link protein;malignant breast neoplasm;mortality;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;personalized medicine;prognostic;protein biomarkers;protein profiling;resistance mechanism;screening;targeted cancer therapy;therapy development;tissue processing;tool;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY	BERKELEY	CA	UNITED STATES	Amy Elizabeth Herr	DCTD	Tawnya C Mckee	1453938	>=$1M	1453938	25-Sep-2017	30-Sep-2017	31-May-2022	RFA-CA-17-023	Moonshot

Tissue diagnostics for precision oncology increasingly rely on multi-valent assays to characterize\ncancer biology and identify therapeutic targets. The power of molecular imaging for cancer diagnosis has been\nwell demonstrated by [18F]fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT), widely used in\nclinical oncology. PET tracers targeted to facets of tumor biology now enable multi-valent molecular imaging to\nidentify therapeutic targets. Early studies show that combined tracer studies, commonly FDG plus a target-\nspecific tracer, are highly predictive of tumor response to targeted therapy. However, emissions from different\nPET tracers are indistinguishable to a PET scanner, requiring separate imaging sessions on separate days for\nmultiple 18F-based tracers (~ 2 hour half-life) in the same patient. This limits the clinical practicality of multi-tracer\nPET, and fails to exploit the full power of multi-tracer PET to quantify tumor in vivo biology and biologic\nheterogeneity for highly variable process such as cancer metabolism. We will overcome this limitation by taking\nadvantage of recent developments in volumetric PET scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis\nmethods from our laboratories to develop Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate multi-valent,\nquantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session to guide precision oncology\nand translational cancer biology research. As such, our proposed technology development project addresses a\nneed, described under Priority Area B for “new capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer\npatients”. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we now propose to integrate and enhance these\nmethodologies to develop and validate Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate quantitative biologic\nparametric images for two or more tracers in a single session. We will develop and test this approach for\nsimultaneous glucose and glutamine metabolism imaging, with the goal of guiding metabolism-targeted therapy\nsuch as inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The project will focus on the\ntechnology developments (largely computational) that enable multi-tracer imaging. Ongoing and separately\nfunded work on clinical studies will acquire data from two separate imaging PET sessions using current\ntechnology and will provide data for method development. We will first optimize tracer dose timing, image\nreconstruction, and image time binning for dual tracer MTV-PET (Aim 1), followed by implementation and\ntechnical validation of image analysis using a mixture analysis approach (Aim 2). This will set the stage for\ntechnical validation of MTV-PET (Aim 3) and an exploratory aim (Aim 4) testing image analytics based on\nmachine learning. Successful completion of our technology development will yield a new method for multi-tracer\nPET that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarker and precision oncology research,\nconsistent with goals of RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B.	4D Imaging;Address;Agreement;Algorithms;Area;Biological Assay;Biology;Breast Cancer Patient;Cancer Biology;Cancer Diagnostics;Cancer Patient;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Cluster Analysis;Consumption;Data;Data Set;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Dose;Emerging Technologies;Funding;Glucose;Glutaminase;Glutamine;Glycolysis;Goals;Half-Life;Heterogeneity;Hour;Human;Image;Image Analysis;Injection of therapeutic agent;Kinetics;Laboratories;Lactate Dehydrogenase;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic;Metabolism;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Outcome;Patients;Phenotype;Positron-Emission Tomography;Process;Radiation exposure;Reference Standards;Research;Technology;Testing;Three-Dimensional Image;Time;Tissues;Tracer;Tumor Biology;Validation;Work;analytical method;anticancer research;base;cancer diagnosis;cancer imaging;clinical Diagnosis;cohort;diagnostic biomarker;genomic biomarker;glucose metabolism;high dimensionality;image reconstruction;imaging biomarker;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant breast neoplasm;metabolic rate;method development;molecular imaging;novel;parametric imaging;personalized diagnostics;phenotypic biomarker;precision oncology;radiotracer;reconstruction;response;targeted treatment;technology development;therapeutic target;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor metabolism;whole body imaging	UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	JOEL S KARP,DAVID A.

Colonoscopy as primary screening has been accompanied by\na modest but steady decline in CRC incidence through identification and removal of precursor lesions, the\nadenomatous polyp. Indeed, there has been a 32% decline between years 2000-2013 in CRC incidence in\npatients over age 50 (thus eligible for screening). Strikingly, during this same time period, the incidence rate for\nthose under 50 has increased by 22%. Thus, new and effective screening strategies are urgently needed to\naddress the rising burden of CRC (≤50 years) which is expected to increase over the next decade with the rising\nyoung population. The objective of the R33 Moonshot Project is to develop a highly advanced screening\napproach to identify the subset of young patients who actually harbor advanced adenomas and could benefit\nfrom colonoscopy via a test that is sensitive to advanced adenomas, low-cost, and that can be carried out in a\nprimary care setting. To this end, we have developed a new technology, partial wave spectroscopic (PWS)\nmicroscopy or nanocytology. Nanocytology performed on colonocytes swabbed from the rectal mucosa is able\nto identify nanoscale alterations in higher order chromatin structure, which are highly accurate markers of the\npresence of advanced adenomas that might be located anywhere in the colon. The goal for the proposed\nproject is to finalize the PWS technology, turn it into a practical, accurate, and low-cost test that is viable\nfor young population screening, and conduct a pre-definitive clinical trial. We aim to achieve sensitivity\nand specificity over 90%. Upon the completion of this moonshot project, nanocytology will be ready for a\ndefinitive clinical trial, which can lead to CLIA approval and launch in clinical practice as a laboratory-developed\ntest (LDT).

project	1R33CA225328-01	R33CA225328	9483059	2017	Area A: Development of genetically tractable, driver gene-syngeneic brain tumor models for pre-clinical adoptive TCR-T therapy	Grant	Summary of Work\nMalignant gliomas confer a dismal prognosis and have an inherent tendency to recur despite the most\naggressive of therapies. Recently, significant progress has been made in both understanding the genetic\nfoundation of these tumors as well as how to harness the power of the immune system to target these most\ndevastating tumors. While there has been substantial evidence in support of using T cells to treat established\ntumors in mice and humans, the translational value of these treatments has been limited by the simplicity of\nglioma models used for their development: mostly relying on transplanted tumors that do not recapitulate the\nimmune microenvironment present in human gliomas. To this end, this proposal seeks to develop a\nspontaneous and genetically faithful mouse glioma model by combining the initial IDH1R132H driver mutation\nwith other most common mutations. These models will maintain the integrity of the immune microenvironment\nof the brain and best recapitulating human glioma. With these models, we will also assess the interplay\nbetween glioma development and the immune response as dictated by different genetic mutations.\n Our second aim is to identify IDH1R132H reactive T cell antigen receptors (TCRs). We aim to improve the\ncurrent technology which employs single cell RNAseq to clone both the TCRα and TCRβ chains. We will\noptimize the current cloning procedures to dramatically reduce the reagent expense and labor cost, which is\nessential for its clinical application. This aim will be extended into a translational direction, aim 3, through\ngenetic engineering of T cells to redirect their antigen specificity against IDH1R132H. This aim is essentially a\nproof-of-principle study for TCR-T adoptive transfer immunotherapy in our immune-competent mouse glioma\nmodels.\n Combined, novel animal models and technologies developed in this study will help elucidate the complexities\nunderlying glioma genetics and how these commonly mutated genes contribute to glioma development,\nprogression, and glioma-specific immune suppression mechanisms. In addition, this will also facilitate the\ndevelopment and implementation a novel strategy for glioma immunotherapy.

project	1R33CA225400-01	R33CA225400	9483217	2017	Area B: Precise DCE-MRI Assessment of Brain Tumors	Grant	AREA B: PRECISE DCE-MRI OF BRAIN TUMORS\nPROJECT SUMMARY\nThis project will develop and validate an improved dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI technique for\nassessing brain tumor response to therapy. Rationale: Historically, increases in tumor size or enhancement\nhave signified tumor progression, and decreases in tumor size have signified treatment response. With the\nadvent of novel chemotherapy agents, including immunotherapy, simple changes in size or enhancement are\nno longer sufficient to make treatment decisions. We believe that improved DCE-MRI methods can provide\nnew and powerful biomarkers to image brain tumors and detect early response to therapy. This will enhance\nour ability to prolong survival in a higher proportion of brain tumor patients traditionally regarded as the most\ndire prognostic group (including recurrent high-grade glioma and metastatic melanoma), who are often left out\nof clinical trials due to very short life expectancy. Innovation: We propose Specially Tailored Acquisition and\nReconstruction (STAR) DCE-MRI, in which acquisition and reconstruction are tailored from an estimation-\ntheoretic point of view to create the most accurate and reproducible tracer kinetic (TK) parameter maps, unlike\nconventional approaches that optimize the quality of intermediate images. We will fully integrate TK models\nwith DCE-MRI acquisition and reconstruction. Our preliminary data shows 36-fold improvement in spatial\nresolution and coverage compared to current techniques, with no loss of image quality in brain tumor patients;\nand we expect to only get better. Compared to current state-of-the-art DCE-MRI, this technique will provide\nthree major advances: 1- exquisite (sub-1 mm isotropic) spatial resolution to quantitatively assess narrow\ntumor margins and small lesions, 2- whole-brain coverage including all lesions and all surrounding tissue\nthereby simplifying the exam, 3- robust measurement of patient specific arterial inputs which are required for\naccurate contrast agent kinetic modeling. Approach: We will optimize, technically validate, and clinically\nevaluate STAR DCE-MRI method that provides improved quantitative parametric brain maps including blood-\nbrain barrier leakage and fractional plasma volume. Specifically, we will: 1- optimize and technically validate\nSTAR DCE-MRI to produce accurate and reproducible TK parameter maps, 2- produce a robust clinical\nimplementation of STAR DCE-MRI, and 3- clinically evaluate STAR DCE-MRI in patients with brain tumors,\nspecifically those with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with an anti-angiogenic agent, and those with brain\nmelanoma metastases treated with an immunotherapy agent. Broader Impact: Improved quantitative multi-\nparametric DCE-MRI has a potential role in the assessment of all neurologic diseases that have a\nmicrovascular component. This technical work, particularly leveraging specific nonlinear temporal models\nduring image reconstruction, is likely to have implications for DCE-MRI of prostate, renal, breast, and liver\ntumors as well as outside of DCE-MRI. Importantly it addresses a critical unmet need in oncology in providing\na robust, reproducible, high spatio-temporal resolution and high spatial coverage biomarker as a potential end\npoint for clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents in cancer research.

project	1R33CA263666-01	R33CA263666	10293808	2021	Integrative Visualization of Spatiotemporal Tumor Atlases	Grant	Project Summary\nWith the rise of new high-throughput technologies that enable the measurement of biomolecules at the\nsingle-cell level within the spatial tissue context, emerging human tumor atlases promise to illuminate the role\nof cellular interactions in cancer. Spatiotemporal tumor atlases integrate molecular, cellular, and structural\ninformation, as well as clinical data. Interpretation of the resulting 2D and 3D maps will lead to new insights\ninto molecular processes that drive tumorigenesis and eventually guide the development of new cancer\ntreatment strategies. The development of specialized visual exploration tools to support this discovery process\nis critical. However, these tools must be designed to address several challenges: a large number of features\nsuch as cells or molecules that need to be visualized, the need to link across diverse modalities such as\ngenomic and imaging data, the presence of multiple timepoints and organizational scales, as well as the\nvolume of data generated by many assays. Furthermore, the cancer research community includes a broad\nspectrum of user audiences with varying data visualization needs. Therefore, we propose to create a\nframework for integrative, web-based visualization of human tumor atlases. Our work will be guided by\nuser-centered design processes and we will be collaborating with users in the cancer research community to\nelicit user needs and to evaluate our visualization tools. This will allow us to design and implement\nvisualization tools that are appropriate for the targeted user audiences. Given the diversity and size of the\ndatasets generated by assays used to build tumor atlases, we will design this framework to be extensible and\nscalable from the ground up. We are proposing three distinct aims for this project. One aim is to develop a\nmodular, web-based toolkit for visual analysis of multimodal spatial single-cell cancer datasets. This toolkit\nwill also be available through R and Python APIs for integration into computational notebooks. This will\nenable data analysts and software developers to connect any visualizations created with the toolkit to state of\nthe art computational analysis techniques, which complement the visual exploration supported by the\nvisualizations. Another aim of our work is the design and implementation of novel methods for comparative\nand longitudinal visualization of spatiotemporal tumor atlas data sets. Finally, we will also build a web-based\nplatform that will allow any cancer researcher to create their own interactive visualizations of multimodal\nspatiotemporal tumor atlas datasets through a graphical user interface. Users will also be able to share links to\nthese visualizations with other researchers and the general public.	3-Dimensional;Address;Atlases;Biological Assay;Cells;Cellular Structures;Clinical;Clinical Data;Communication;Communities;Complement;Computer Analysis;Computer software;Computing Methodologies;Custom;Data;Data Set;Development;Ensure;Environment;Evaluation;General Population;Genomics;Human;Image;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Measurement;Methods;Modality;Molecular;Online Systems;Process;Proteomics;Pythons;Research Personnel;Resolution;Role;Techniques;Tissues;Tumor Biology;Visual;Visualization;Visualization software;Work;anticancer research;base;cancer cell;cancer therapy;comparative;data visualization;design;flexibility;graphical user interface;high throughput technology;insight;iterative design;member;metabolomics;multimodal data;multimodality;novel;spatiotemporal;tool;transcriptomics;treatment strategy;tumor;tumorigenesis;user centered design	HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL	BOSTON	MA	UNITED STATES	Nils  Gehlenborg	DCB	DAVID J MILLER	1532606	>=$1M	1532606	20-Sep-2021	24-Sep-2021	31-Aug-2025	RFA-CA-20-044	Moonshot

Our\nproject aims to make single cell genomics data, such as that from the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, more\nexplorable and interpretable by the broader cancer research community. We propose to enhance UCSC Xena,\na widely-used cancer genomics data visualization resource, with new, full-featured single cell data\nvisualizations for investigator-specified, Moonshot-aligned use cases. We will employ User Centered Design\n(UCD), a research-backed process and methodology that involves iterative interactions with users and\ncollaborators, throughout the development of these visualizations. We will work closely with two Cancer\nMoonshot projects, following UCD methodologies, to ensure our visualizations and interfaces serve research\nneeds and are easy to use. In Aim 1 we will collaborate with two cancer research groups to develop novel\nvisualizations for single cell Cancer Moonshot data. We will collaborate with UCSF-led NCI’s Drug Resistance\nand Sensitivity Network to enhance the Xena Browser to elucidate changes in tumors and surrounding\nmicroenvironment in response to therapy, including a visualization to leverage clinical outcomes from bulk\ntumor data. We will collaborate with OHSU Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) center to develop multi-modal\nvisualizations for the HTAN data, including a novel cross-mapping visualization for spatially resolved and\nnon-spatial data multi-modal data. Aim 2 will develop the software infrastructure needed to support these\naccessible, high-performance single-cell data visualizations. This will include performance enhancements for\nthe Xena Browser, hardening our integration with Jupyter Notebook/RStudio and adding connectors to single\ncell data analysis tools, and, finally, incorporating a UCSC-developed Cell State and Microenvironment\nsignature library into our visualizations. Aim 3 will develop user training and support to promote adoption of\nnew visualizations and connected analyses, disseminating these new visualizations and analyses to the widest\npossible community.

However, only a minority of patients derives\nclinical benefit, while some develop off-target effects. To identify novel biomarkers of disease course and\nresponse, as well as potential off-target responses to immunotherapy in cancer patients, the NCI’s Cancer\nMoonshot Initiative (CMI) is supporting a growing number of cancer immunotherapy trials. Our team is at the\nforefront of the CMI efforts with two grants: 1) a U24 on high-dimensional immune monitoring of NCI-supported\nimmunotherapy trials as part of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP); and 2) a U01 on\ncharacterizing and predicting a toxic side-effect of immunotherapy, colitis, in immune checkpoint blockade-\ntreated cancer patients, as part of the Immuno-Oncology Translational Network (IOTN). However, with the\nrapid development of new and improved technologies, these studies produce diverse data types of ever-\nexpanding size and complexity. Visualizing, exploring, and communicating results from the computational\nanalysis of these disparate high-dimensional immune monitoring assays is imperative but challenging,\nespecially because many visualization tools are either built only for in-house utilization or typically specialize in\nonly one or perhaps a few data types. At the same time, cross-assay or cross-participant data interpretation is\nthe only way to identify relevant immune biomarkers that impact clinical trial design and clinical cancer care.\nThere is thus an unmet need for easy-to-use interactive tools for integrative exploration of cancer patient\nimmune monitoring data by biologists and clinicians. This proposal aims to address this need through the\ndevelopment of a user-friendly, integrative web-based visualization tool, Precision Immunology Monitoring\nAnalysis and Visualization Online (PRIMAVO), that will enable researchers of all computational skill levels to\nvisually analyze and interactively explore immune monitoring assay results that belong to a cancer\nimmunotherapy trial, at multiple levels of granularity. The PRIMAVO tool will scale with current and future data\ngrowth and complexity to enable fast and effective research towards identifying associations between different\ndata types, participants, and clinical variables. We hypothesize that developing (i) cohort-level; and (ii)\nparticipant-level visualizations that integrate views across multiple immune data types, participants, cohorts\nand time points will provide a deep, comprehensive view of events; and that (iii) the content and features of\nPRIMAVO will be greatly enhanced by engaging with the user community during its development. The results\nfrom this highly integrated effort will have important clinical and public health implications by accelerating our\nunderstanding of the immune responses of cancer patients to immunotherapies and significantly impact the\nrate at which immune biomarkers from clinical trials will be identified, interpreted, verified and translated into\nclinically actionable findings. Overall, PRIMAVO will be a highly valuable tool for the research community.	16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Address;Antigens;Award;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Cancer Patient;Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Colitis;Communication;Communities;Computer Analysis;Custom;Cytometry;Data;Data Analyses;Data Commons;Data Set;Development;Dimensions;Disease;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Event;Feedback;Flow Cytometry;Future;Grant;Growth;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunologic Markers;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunology;Immunooncology;Immunotherapy;Infrastructure;Interview;Malignant Neoplasms;Metagenomics;Minority;Mission;Monitor;Mutation;Online Systems;Output;Participant;Patients;Principal Component Analysis;Proteomics;Public Health;Research;Research Personnel;Serology;Shotguns;Standardization;Surveys;Technology;Time;Toxic effect;Translating;Visual;Visualization;Visualization software;analysis pipeline;anticancer research;base;biomarker discovery;cancer care;cancer immunotherapy;clinical practice;clinical trial participant;clinically actionable;cohort;data exploration;data visualization;demographics;design;diverse data;exome;experience;flexibility;high dimensionality;immune checkpoint blockade;immune-related adverse events;immunotherapy clinical trials;immunotherapy trials;improved;interactive tool;interest;medical schools;microbiome analysis;novel marker;novel therapeutics;response;response biomarker;side effect;skills;tool;tool development;transcriptome sequencing;treatment response;tumor;user-friendly;web-based tool	ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Zeynep Hulya Gumus	DCB	DAVID J MILLER	1542450	>=$1M	1542450	23-Sep-2021	23-Sep-2021	31-Aug-2025	RFA-CA-20-044	Moonshot
project	1R37CA230617-01A1	R37CA230617	9683816	2019	Hormone signaling and translation control in advanced prostate cancer	Grant	ABSTRACT\nThe recent advent of highly potent inhibitors of the androgen receptor and androgen biosynthesis has had the\nunfortunate iatrogenic effect of fueling new lethal prostate cancer phenotypes in patients. In particular, non-\nneuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an aggressive form of this\ndisease, is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The main barriers against\ntherapeutic advances are a paucity of relevant disease models and a very poor understanding of the\nmechanisms that give rise to this phenotype. The process of protein synthesis has long been considered\nsubordinate to alterations at the levels of DNA and RNA in cancer etiology. However, work from our laboratory\nand others have revealed that protein synthesis control is a dynamic process that coordinates not only bulk\nmRNA translation, but also the specialized translation of distinct mRNAs important for cancer phenotypes.\nRecently, our laboratory has developed and characterized a new in vitro and in vivo toolkit of both human and\nmurine androgen receptor-low CRPC. We have used these models to discover a critical link between androgen\nreceptor signaling and the process of mRNA translation initiation, which is critical for androgen receptor-low\nCRPC growth. We hypothesize that androgen receptor-low CRPC is driven by the specific translation of\ndistinct mRNA networks, thereby leading to persistent tumor growth, which may represent a therapeutic\nvulnerability. Our long-term objective is to utilize state-of-the-art mouse models, ribosome profiling, and patient\nderived xenografts to definitively investigate the fundamental link between the androgen receptor and protein\nsynthesis control in a highly relevant and newly emerging disease course for prostate cancer patients. To do\nso, we will address the following aims: 1) determine the mechanism by which the androgen receptor\ncommunicates with the translation apparatus, 2) delineate how aberrant protein synthesis drives the translation\nof distinct oncogenic mRNAs, and 3) elucidate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting translation initiation in\nandrogen receptor-low CRPC.\nUltimately, these studies are poised to uncover a new paradigm for gene regulation in androgen receptor-low\nprostate cancer and provide the preclinical basis for targeting the protein synthesis apparatus in an\nincreasingly common highly aggressive disease.

With the recent success of anti-viral therapies, the etiology of HCC in the American population is\nprojected to shift from viral (HBV, HCV) hepatitis to primarily fatty liver disease in the near future.\nCurrently, only one effective systemic therapy has been developed for HCC – the multi-kinase inhibitor\nsorafenib. The development of more selective molecularly targeted therapies has so far been unsuccessful\nin this disease. This failure is due in part to the lack of a preclinical, patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-\nenabling HCC tumor bank drawn from an American HCC patient population to help patient selection and\nmodel new therapies. In addition, modeling underlying liver disease has rarely been pursued in preclinical\ndrug development. PDX-enabling tumor banks exist in Asia, but tend to be from viral and alcohol-driven\ndisease, as opposed to obesity, which is the driver of growing incidence in the West. Massachusetts General\nHospital (MGH) has begun collecting primary patient HCC tumors from surgeries performed in Boston\nand will partner with Woodland Pharmaceuticals, the applicant, to expand these into a PDX resource better\nenabling new HCC therapy development. Woodland will expand the tumors to up to five passages in mice\nand then characterize the passages for drug sensitivity, both in vitro and in vivo to a panel of drugs.\nDemonstration of stable expansion will lead to a phase 2 application to further expand and characterize the\nHCC tumor bank (including tracking of patient treatment and outcomes at the academic site), in models\nwith underlying liver disease, in readiness for PDX service commercialization in the USA.

project	1R41CA217503-01	R41CA217503	9346494	2017	Therapeutic disruption of Connexin43-mediated microtubule regulation to target glioblastoma cancer stem cells	Grant	Project Summary\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal incurable human diseases. Even with aggressive therapies\nincluding surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy using temozolomide (TMZ), the median\nsurvival for GBM patients is only 14 months. In fact, GBM cancer cells are highly infiltrative and comprise a sub-\npopulation of glioma stem cells (GSCs) with tumorigenic properties regulated by the tumor microenvironment,\nand often resistant to chemotherapy and irradiation treatments. The remaining GSCs can then enter an active\nstate of self-renewal, and asymmetric division that recapitulates the heterogeneous tumor. As a result, all treated\nGBM patients will experience tumor recurrence and subsequent surgeries and toxic radiotherapy and\nchemotherapy regimens are harmful for the patient and often remain insufficient. There is therefore an urgent\nneed for new therapeutic drug to target GSCs and treat this devastating disease. Glioblastoma resistance to\nTMZ correlates with the expression of the gap junction protein Connexin43 (Cx43), a protein which enables\ncommunication between cells, and increased levels of Cx43 are observed in GSCs. The function of Cx43, is not\nlimited to forming channels for the passage of ions and small molecules between cells, but also participates in\ncell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. Therefore, targeting Cx43 activity holds promise to treat GBM and\nprevent tumor recurrence. In this proposed research we use a novel Cx43 mimetic peptide named JM2\n(juxtamembrane 2) that encompasses the microtubule binding sequence of Cx43. Our preliminary data show\nthat JM2 alters Cx43 binding to microtubule, decreases the formation of Cx43 gap junctions, and inhibits cell-\ncell communication in GSCs. Most importantly, we reveal the therapeutic potential of JM2 in decreasing GSC\nsurvival in vitro and in vivo. With the goal of developing a new therapy based upon JM2 to target GSCs in GBM,\nour overall objective is to generate JM2-loaded polyanhydride biodegradable nanoparticles (JM2-NPs) for\nsustained delivery of JM2 to GSCs. We will use high-resolution microscopy techniques including stochastic\noptical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and biochemistry assays to analyze the effect of JM2-NPs in GSCs\nderived from human primary GBM cells freshly isolated from dissected patient tumor. Finally, we will assess the\ntherapeutic effect of JM2-NPs on GSCs ex vivo using a three dimensional patient GBM-derived organoid model,\nand in vivo using an orthotopic GBM mouse model. These results will validate the potent effect of JM2 peptide\nfor treatment of high Cx43/chemoresistant GSCs and present a therapeutic opportunity to prevent GBM tumor\nrecurrence. The proposed research is significant because this innovative approach will not only allow us to\ndevelop novel therapies for lethal GBM but also will lay foundation on potential clinical trials in newly diagnosed\nGBM patients in the near future. Finally, our new JM2-loaded nanoparticles may be scalable to other CNS\ndiseases that could benefit from targeting Cx43-microtubule interaction.

project	1R41CA217546-01	R41CA217546	9347537	2017	Novel Reagents for Breast Tumor SPECT Imaging	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nBreast cancer screening using mammograms and other imaging techniques are the first line of defense\nagainst the disease as a means to detect pre-cancerous lesions. The diagnostic power of advanced\nimaging techniques could benefit tremendously from improved contrast agents that rapidly and selectively\naccumulate in the tumor lesions and provide high tumor-to-normal tissue ratios, as well as minimizing\nexposure of patients to radiation by lowering injected activity of the reagents. We propose to develop novel\ncontrast agents for use in breast cancer imaging that can enhance image resolution by selectively targeting\nand delivering imaging probes directly into tumor lesions with little or no accumulation in the surrounding\nnormal tissue. We have developed an antibody-based delivery platform that exploits a caveloae-mediated\ntransvascular transport pathway to target and rapidly deliver cargo across the restrictive vascular\nendothelium directly into tumor lesions following intravenous injection. We propose to conjugate 99mTc via a\nchelating moiety to the targeting antibody (mAnnA1) and to test the resulting imaging probe in rodent\nmodels that will include induced metastatic and spontaneous breast tumors. We will optimize the imaging\nprotocol by studying biodistribution of the reagent and determine key parameters in order to characterize\nselectivity and targeting specificity of the novel reagent.

project	1R41CA247165-01A1	R41CA247165	10021088	2020	Tumor Stroma Breaking System for Efficient Delivery of Therapeutic Agents	Grant	Cancer immunotherapy using adoptive T cell transfer has shown its promises in the treatment of hematological\nmalignancies. Despite tremendous efforts, results of clinical trials using tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or\nengineered CAR-T cells in human solid tumors have not produced desired therapeutic responses. In solid\ntumors, there are multiple barriers that prevent cytotoxic T cells reaching tumor cells. First, abnormal blood\nvessels limit T cell delivery into solid tumors, especially tumor center. The presence of dense tumor stromal cells\nand extracellular matrix create a physical barrier that traps T cells in an immunosuppressive stroma\nmicroenvironment. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop novel approaches to improve delivery efficiency\nof cytotoxic T cells in solid tumors. The translational goal of the proposed phase I research is to develop\nand validate a stroma-breaking therapeutic T cell delivery system for immunotherapy in human solid\ntumors with a focus on pancreatic and colon cancers. We have developed a receptor targeted and stroma\nbreaking drug delivery platform with novel designs to overcome tumor stromal cellular and extracellular matrix\nbarriers. We have demonstrated its ability to deliver nanoparticle-drug crossing tumor vessels, migrating through\ntumor stroma, and penetrating the basement membrane to reach tumor cells. This recombinant targeting ligand\nconsists of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) binding domain of uPA fused with the catalytic\ndomain of matrix metalloproteinase-14 (ATFmmp14). Our preliminary results showed that co-delivery of T cells\nwith ATFmmp14 ligands led to significant increases in the numbers of T cells delivered in tumors following\nintravenous delivery in mouse colon and pancreatic tumor models as well as a human colon cancer patient\nderived xenograft (PDX) model. In this phase I project, we aim to determine the effect of ATFmmp14-T cell\ndelivery system on intratumoral delivery and distribution using the MHC-non-restricted cytotoxic ɣδ T cells as a\nT cell model system in human colon and pancreatic cancer PDX models. First, we will develop the best\nformulation of ATFmmp14 conjugated T cell delivery platform using ɣδ T cells obtained from healthy donors in\nhuman pancreatic and colon PDX models (Aim1). Next, we will determine whether ATFmmp14 ligand can\nimprove selective delivery of ɣδ T cells into pancreatic and colon PDX tumors and promote cell migration through\nstroma and basement membrane barriers to reach tumor cells (Aim 2). Biodistribution and systemic toxicity in\nnormal organs and tissues will also be evaluated (Aim 2). Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of targeted delivery of\nɣδ T cells without or with the combination of a chemotherapy drug will be determined in pancreatic and colon\nPDX models (Aim 3). Results of the above proposed studies should allow us building a strong foundation for\nconducting further translational studies in the Phase II research project to bring this approach into a clinical trial.\nResult of this study will also lead to future development and commercialization of this unique approach for other\nadaptive T transfer therapies, such as CAR-T, tumor specific T cells, and tumor infiltrating T cells.

Grant	Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is one of two major types of esophageal cancer, which causes 509,000\ndeaths worldwide annually. EAC diagnosis is made using the invasive, expensive, risky, and not universally\naccessible procedure, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Thus, there is a pressing need for easier, safer,\ncheaper strategies for EAC diagnosis. Our novel strategy builds on exciting preliminary data in EAC patients\ninvolves a swallowable, retrievable sponge capsule device combined with a DNA methylation biomarker panel\n(JHU patent pending). Capsulomics, a new startup established specifically for this project, will commercialize\nthis diagnostic assay, termed “EsoSAVE,” for EAC detection.\n This Phase I STTR application contains three Specific Aims to implement this strategy. Aim 1 will optimize\nand validate the EsophaCap DNA extraction procedure. Aim 2 will generate a multi-parameter statistical model\nto further strengthen our promising methylation biomarkers. Aim 3 will validate the EsoSAVE test in sponge\nsamples from normal and EAC patients. These Aims will address important scientific questions while\nsimultaneously advancing the EsoSAVE diagnostic test toward commercial implementation.

The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately 400,000 (or ~60-70%) of\npatients undergoing chemotherapy suffer from CIPN. These patients may need to terminate chemotherapy\ntreatment if experiencing symptoms, such as numbness, pain, temperature sensitivity, or tingling. Cancer\nsurvivors furthermore often have to live with CIPN for the rest of their lives. To date are no treatments available\nwith which to tackle this problem. CIPN costs the healthcare system upward of $13B annually for long-term\ncare of the patients. Thus, there is a significant clinical and economical need to develop drug therapies.\nAvantyx Pharmaceuticals, LLC has identified a new compound targeting the Matrix-Metalloproteinase 13\n(MMP-13), which was shown to promote the degeneration of sensory nerve endings in animal models for CIPN\ninduced by paclitaxel treatment. The key focus of this Phase I project is to characterize a novel MMP-13\ninhibitor for its bioavailability, efficacy, specificity, and toxicity in a rat model of paclitaxel-induced peripheral\nneuropathy, which is following studies in which we established the efficacy of this inhibitor in zebrafish. Key\ngoals are to establish parameters, such as optimal route of administration (oral or topical), optimal dosing, and\ntarget specificity, which is necessary to proceed to further drug development studies in Phase II.

project	1R42CA228875-01	R42CA228875	9558406	2018	Targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells with custom-designed viral vectors	Grant	Abstract\nGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of adult brain cancers with a median survival of <15 months\ndespite aggressive standard chemoradiation. GBM are formed by GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) - a major\ncontributor to tumor recurrence and a natural focus for therapeutic development. There are two main reasons\nresponsible for treatment failure: 1) high intra- and inter-tumor cellular and molecular heterogeneity with\nmultiple subclones possessing distinct genetic determinants; 2) GSCs exhibit multiple redundant signaling\npathways requiring simultaneous targeting of overlapping pathways. We have invented and biologically\nvalidated a novel tandem computational platform, GeneRep-nSCORE that integrates large-scale gene\nexpression profiles with genomic changes to identify common founding alterations or master regulators of\nGSCs that span a large number, if not all, GSC subclones within and across GBM tumors. We discovered such\na core set of four common master regulators in GCSs that are outstanding targets for clinical development.\nExpression of these four factors was sufficient to reprogram normal astrocytes to GSCs, whereas their\ndepletion profoundly abrogated GSCs, and thus tumor development in vivo, in all eight lines of patient-derived\nGSCs of varied genetic and molecular backgrounds examined to date.\nThe goal of this application is to develop a customized set of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based genetic\ntools to target the whole spectrum of GSCs (Phase I) for the purpose of delivering targeting constructs to\ndeplete the four common master regulators responsible for malignant transformation and proliferation in GSCs\n(Phase II). The specific objectives of this proposal are: (i) using directed evolution and available combinatorial\nAAV capsid library, and for the first time, introducing a dynamic mode of administration of a library reagent\nover the time course of tumor progression, to greatly increase the probability of identifying novel AAV variants\nspecifically targeting slow-, and fast-cycling GSCs in patient-derived xenograft models (PDX) (Phase I); (ii) To\ndesign and validate a panel of AAV vectors that express shRNAs targeting core master regulators of GSCs to\nidentify leads for preclinical testing; (iii) To optimize modes of viral delivery, pharmacokinetics and\npharmacodynamics parameters, and safety and toxicity in normal and PDX treated with lead targeting AAV\ncassettes; and (iv) Based on these results, tools and basic DMPK data created, to conduct preclinical efficacy\nstudies in PDX treated with lead targeting AAV cassettes either alone or in combination with standard\nchemoradiotherapy (Phase II) to prepare for an investigative new drug application for clinical testing in patients\nwith GBM, and for commercial development of this novel technology.

MM is the 2nd most common blood cancer with\nan estimated 32,000 new cases and 13,000 deaths per year. Accurate detection is critical for enhancing\nsurvival in MM patients. Traditional skeletal survey and bone scans have sensitivity limitations for osteolytic\nlesions manifested in MM. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) performed with a PET radiopharmaceutical\n(imaging agent) is a sensitive, quantitative and non-invasive clinical imaging technology to accurately detect,\nlocalize and phenotype MM cells throughout the body. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the only FDA-approved\nPET imaging agent for MM. Unfortunately, MM cells express low levels of GLUT-1 transporter and hexokinase,\nwhich are required for FDG uptake and retention. Additionally MM bone marrow harbors FDG-avid\ninflammatory cells. There is an unmet need for molecularly targeted, sensitive and specific MM imaging agents\nthat can accurately stage and restage MM, identify high-risk MM patients, guide personalized MM treatment,\nand evaluate clinical response to treatment. The product of this STTR will be a specific and sensitive PET\nimaging agent (64Cu-LLP2A) for MM. Published data and ongoing first-in-human trial results have significantly\ninformed the Phase I and II aims of this proposal. The Phase I Segment consists of two specific aims: (1)\nPerform dose escalation and single dose toxicity testing in mice. (2) Compile data for new dose and submit\namendment of eIND to FDA. Three milestones will be met in Phase I: (1) A new mass will be selected based\non no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), i.e. clinical signs of organ toxicity (vehicle vs experimental). (2)\nBased on the new determined mass, and in vivo preclinical image quality data, a new specific activity (Ci/mol)\nwill be established. (3) Obtain FDA approval of Sarya sponsored amended eIND application. The Phase II\nsegment involves a clinical trial and has one specific aim: Quantify the efficacy of 64Cu-LLP2A-PET imaging for\ndetecting active MM in humans in a prospective imaging trial. Phase II milestones are: (1) Demonstrate high\ndetection rates (% of scans that are positive for a focal lesion, p<0.05) for 64Cu-LLP2A versus FDG in MM\npatients. (2) Accuracy of 64Cu-LLP2A for active MM will be assessed using standard-of-care bone marrow\n(BM) biopsies and serum biomarker M-protein levels as the standards of reference. A correlation coefficient of\n0.7 will be considered reasonably strong. In summary, Phase I will prove feasibility that 64Cu-LLP2A is tolerable\nwith NOAEL resulting in a new eIND. Phase II will provide 64Cu-LLP2A-PET preliminary performance data to\nsupport a New Drug Application for 64Cu-LLP2A as a New Molecular Entity (NME) for FDA approval of Phase 2\nclinical trials.

project	1R43CA246766-01	R43CA246766	9902864	2019	Protease Activated Masked Interferon to Treat Malignancy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nIFN and IFN (type I) and IFN (type II) are potent mediators of anti-cancer immunity having both direct anti-\nproliferative effects against many cancers as well as a multitude of anti-tumor immunotherapeutic effects.\nHowever, while IFN has efficacy against multiple human cancers its clinical utility to date has been limited by\nthe inability to achieve effective concentrations of IFN at tumor sites without causing systemic toxicity. Several\ngroups including ours have successfully approached this problem by using the tumor-targeting ability of\nmonoclonal antibodies to carry IFNs directly to tumor sites. These approaches have shown great promise and\nanti-CD20-IFN2 is in clinical trials by ImmunGene and anti-CD138-IFN2 is being developed by Qwixel\nTherapeutics under a license from UCLA. Although using the antibody binding specificity to target tumor-\nassociated antigens delivers a greater percentage of the IFN to the site of the tumor than is achieved when IFN\nis injected by itself, the attached interferon still is recognized and bound by interferon receptors expressed\nthroughout the body that are not tumor associated. This binding can result both in less IFN reaching the tumor\nand in unwanted off-target toxicity. The goal of the present studies will be to produce anti-IFN fusion proteins\nin which the IFN will only bind IFN receptors once it reaches the tumor. To achieve that goal we will attach a\nmask to the IFN, which will inhibit its activity. This mask will be separated from the IFN by a peptide linker that\nis a site for proteolytic cleavage. A hallmark of cancer is increased proteolytic activity in tumor tissue and the\nsurrounding microenvironment. We therefore hypothesize that we can achieve improved tumor targeting of\nIFN activity by producing it as a prodrug that will be activated only in the tumor microenvironment following\nremoval of the mask by the tumor associated proteases. Preliminary studies have identified a potential mask\nand cleavable peptide linker for IFN. We will now use tumor cell lines and extracts to confirm that the mask\ninhibits IFNα activity, that it can be removed within the tumor microenvionment and that the unmasked protein\nis now active both in vitro and in xenograft models. Humanized NSG mice will be used to determine if the\nmasked interferon fusion protein elicits a decreased inflammatory response compared to unmasked IFN.\nSimilar approaches will be used to produce a masked IFN using either a peptide or scFv mask. The resulting\nmasked IFN will be characterized as will be done for IFN. With the successful completion of these\nexperiments, Qwixel will have novel IFN fusion proteins that are even more effective in delivering large\namounts of IFN to tumor sites in the absence of systemic toxicity.

project	1R44CA217528-01A1	R44CA217528	9410312	2017	Novel Fluorescent Diagnostic Agents for Detection, Staging, andIntraoperative Imaging of Tumors	Grant	Abstract\nThe goal of this project is to develop IV injectable fluorescent agents for use in intraoperative\nimaging of peritoneal metastatic tumors. Significance: Peritoneal metastatic cancers have an\nincidence of 250,000/per year in the US and are primarily treated with surgery. Complete surgical\ntumor resection is a gold-standard treatment goal that can increase the 5-year patient survival to\n50%, whereas incomplete tumor resection (<2mm) could drastically reduce the survival to a mere\nfew months. Current clinical imaging technologies such as PET, MRI and CT have limitations for\nguiding cancer surgery including inability to be used intraoperatively due to safety associated with\nionizing radiation, as well as limitations on sensitivity and tumor specificity especially for lesions\nsmaller than 10mm. Conventional fluorescent molecular probes in development typically target\ntumor proteins and are limited in imaging the heterogeneous onco-geno-phenotypes of peritoneal\nmetastasis that have multiple tissues of origin and vary in protein expression levels. In order to\nreduce incomplete tumor resection and improve survival, there is an urgent need for clear visual\ncontrast imaging agents that enable more precise and specific detection of peritoneal metastasis\ntumors intraoperatively and in real-time. Hypothesis: OncoNano’s approach of targeting tumor\nacidosis which is ubiquitously expressed as a cancer biomarker across tumors, coupled with\nOncoNano’s ultra-sensitive pH fluorescent digital sensors, provides a broad based approach to\nimage the heterogeneous peritoneal metastasis with high specificity and sensitivity. Preliminary\nData: We have demonstrated that OncoNano’s fluorescent agents image tumors across a variety\nof solid tumor types (14 tested to date), including peritoneal metastasis to submillimeter precision\nin SCID mouse models. OncoNano’s agents provided a digital (ON-OFF) response which offered\nclear tumor delineation, and lower detection limits (>10x) compared with state of the art PET-FDG\nimaging. Surgical tumor resection using OncoNano imaging agent showed significant (40-50%)\nsurvival benefit in SCID mouse models compared with conventional white light based surgery.\nSpecific Aims: The scientific aims of this project will enable OncoNano to clinically translate, the\nultrasensitive pH probes and develop it from the lab bench through to establishing reproducible\nmanufacturing of a stable formulation, to establishing safety and pharmacology, for an FDA IND\nfiling. The specific aims in the SBIR Phase I, addresses the nanoprobe stability requirement, and\naddresses the nanoprobe sensitivity and specificity requirement in in-vivo models. The specific\naims in Phase 2 of the project addresses the critical milestones on the path to clinical translation\nincluding- the scale-up requirement to meet the GLP and human testing needs, a demonstration\nof product safety in GLP in-vivo studies, culminating in an IND filing with the FDA.

project	1R44CA221624-01	R44CA221624	9409833	2017	Monitoring immune response to immunotherapies in cancer patients with VisAcT PET tracer	Grant	Abstract\nCellSight is a clinical stage company developing PET imaging tools that can increase the\nprobability of clinical success of immunotherapies by determining early in the therapeutic\nregimen if the cancer patient is responding to their immunotherapy. Cancer\nimmunotherapies that harness the body's immune system to help fight cancer do not\nwork for everyone; in fact, success rates can be as low as 20%. This means that up to\n80% of patients undergoing immunotherapy are spending over $100,000 and investing 6\nto 10 months on ineffective treatments. Our lead imaging tracer, [18F]-FAraG product\nnamed VisAcT, leverages existing health and PET imaging infrastructure but is specific\nfor visualizing immune response. This whole body visualization will provide clinicians\ncritical information to help make early decisions in the treatment regimen and increase\nchances of patient survival.\nCellSight is partnering with pharma and academia on various projects to validate this\ncritically needed immune response monitoring tool as immunotherapies and\ncombinational therapies are showing great promise. The sheer number of combinations\nare staggering yet there are no blood biomarkers or imaging tools available that can be\npredictive of responders versus nonresponders. Even if accurate blood biomarkers were\nto became available in the near future, whole body imaging will still be critically needed\nto determine local immune response site by site in the metastatic patient who are the\nones being administered immunotherapies. Clinical symptoms during immunotherapy\nare very perplexing, as it might seem a patient is progressing when in fact their immune\nsystem is actively fighting the cancer or there might be a delay before immune response\nis apparent through traditional measures. An immune response monitoring tool, such as\nVisAcT, will be key in enabling success for immunotherapies.\nVisAcT was first discovered and developed in the Gambhir lab (Chair of Radiology at\nStanford) and is exclusively licensed to CellSight. CellSight has obtained an IND\nprimarily through funding from the NCI. We are currently conducting Phase 1 clinical\ntrials at University of California San Francisco for various solid tumors including\nMelanoma, Lung and Bladder under Drs, Daud, Gubens and Fong respectively and are\nabout to launch a Head/Neck cancer trial at Stanford under Dr. Colevas. Our primary\ntarget market is the immuno-oncology market however since the tracer shows immune\nresponse that is specific to activated T cells it can be useful for other immune modulated\ndiseases such as Graft vs Host Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis.

project	1U01AA027681-01	U01AA027681	9626297	2018	Immunosuppressive mechanisms responsible for development of non-viral liver cancer and control of its response to immune checkpoint inhibitors	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nThis project will explore adaptive immune mechanisms that control development of hepatocellular carcinoma\n(HCC), a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and dictate its responsiveness to PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint\ninhibitors. Our team, including Michael Karin, Ph.D. and Shabnam Shalapour, Ph.D. at UCSD School of Medicine\nand Hidekazu Tsukamoto, D.V.M., Ph.D. and Anthony El-Khoueiry, M.D. at USC Keck School of Medicine,\nrepresents an ideal blend of basic researchers, translational scientists and oncologists who are interested in\nHCC molecular pathogenesis and treatment, especially in HCC caused by non-alcoholic (NASH) and alcoholic\n(ASH) steatohepatitis. Although the US incidence of HCC and its associated mortality have nearly tripled in the\npast generation, insufficient effort has been made toward identification and development of innovative and\neffective HCC therapies. However, the ideal and timely confluence of basic preclinical research and applied\nclinical studies carried out by our team members has the potential to critically transform HCC treatment forever.\nTogether we found that chronic liver inflammation results in suppression of HCC-protective immunosurveillance\nto support rapid malignant progression. This unique immunopathogenic mechanism renders HCC responsive to\ndrugs that disrupt the PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint, but even the impressive response seen thus far and the selection\nof patients who will benefit from this therapeutic approach can be further improved. Such improvements can only\nbe achieved by a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitors act, the factors\nthat determine their efficacy, and the causes of treatment failure. We will achieve these goals through integrated\nstudies of clinical specimens collected by Dr. El-Khoueiry and sophisticated, faithful and robust mouse models\nof non-viral HCC developed by Drs. Tsukamoto, Shalapour, and Karin. The immune mechanisms that control\nNASH- and ASH-driven HCC development in these models are highly similar to those that operate in human\npatients. Using this integrated approach, we will pursue five specific aims: 1) determine whether serum IgA\nconcentrations correlate with therapeutic response to PD-1 blockade in patients with non-viral HCC; 2) develop\nreliable mouse models of ASH-driven HCC; 3) compare the immunosuppressive mechanisms that contribute to\ndevelopment of NASH- and ASH-driven HCC and control their response to PD-L1 blockade; 4) determine\nwhether excessive peritumoral fibrosis correlates with diminished response to PD-1 blockade in HCC patients;\nand 5) determine whether agents that inhibit or attenuate stellate cell activation potentiate the response to PD-\n1/PD-L1 blockade in non-viral HCC. The successful completion of these studies will result in substantial\nimprovements to HCC immunotherapy and will establish reliable procedures for identification of patients who are\nmost likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 targeting drugs, advances that will result in significant cost savings which\nmay amount to hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

project	1U01AI156189-01	U01AI156189	9921601	2020	Finding the optimal balance of immunotherapy efficacy and toxicity.	Grant	U01 Abstract\nDespite extensive research into cancer immunotherapy, immune-related adverse events (irAE)\nremain a critical and poorly understood issue. To address this critical need, we have assembled a\nmultidisciplinary research team with broad and relevant expertise. The co-PIs of this proposal have\nexpertise in cancer immunotherapy, immunology, assay development, and bioinformatics. Together, we\nhave assembled a cohort of ~400 cancer patients treated with ICI, collecting longitudinal treatment, efficacy,\nand toxicity data, as well as blood samples at pre-treatment baseline, throughout therapy, and at time of\ntoxicity. In our real-world data set, over 10 percent of cases have a history of autoimmune disease,\nproviding insight into use of ICI in a population widely excluded from clinical trials yet routinely treated with\nthese therapies off protocol. Our high-quality clinical data annotation—without which correlative studies\nhave little meaning—addresses the reality that irAE may occur months after ICI initiation and are far more\ncomplex to detect and characterize than toxicities of conventional chemotherapy or molecularly targeted\ntherapies. Through existing funding mechanisms, we have already completed autoantibody, cytokine,\ngenetic, and functional assays in these cases. However, we do not currently have resources for\ncomprehensive, integrated analysis of these diverse laboratory and clinical data. The overarching goal of\nthis U01 proposal is to determine the optimal balance between ICI efficacy and toxicity, ultimately\nidentifying a set of biomarkers useful for selection of patients, treatment type and duration, and\nclinical monitoring. We will achieve this through determination of cellular immunity, comprehensive data\nanalysis, and clinical validation. We have three Aims: (1) Determine cellular immunity in patients\nexperiencing irAE and/or achieving beneficial responses from ICI. We will perform mass cytometry\n(CyTOF) and T-cell receptor sequencing at multiple time-points. (2) Determine genetic, humoral, and\ncellular factors associated with irAE and/or beneficial responses from ICI. We will develop a database\nto integrate and analyze the CyTOF and T-cell receptor sequencing data with clinical efficacy and toxicity\ndata, as well as data from the assays already completed through other mechanisms. (3) Perform analytical\nand clinical validation of emerging biomarkers. We will apply the best classifying phenotypes emerging\nfrom our comprehensive and integrated data analysis to a test set of patients from our existing cohort,\neventually identifying a subset of biomarkers with potential for clinical application. Together, these Aims\ndirectly address the FOA purpose of reducing the incidence and/or severity of irAE while retaining anti-\ntumor efficacy.

This increasingly\naccurate mutational landscape has led to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic\ninterventions. However, there is widespread biological and clinical heterogeneity in tumors, even\nwhen they share the same driver oncogene mutation. In addition, a high degree of dynamic\nplasticity and adaptability makes cancers display complex patterns of acquired resistance that\nmanifest clinically. In a similar way, the wide variability of clinical responses to immunotherapy\nand the onset of immune escape, are becoming a formidable obstacle to fully realize the\npotential of many new and potentially effective immunotherapies. In this project we will\nevaluate a rational systematic approach to characterize oncogenic states and their most salient\ngenomic and immune hallmarks in order to infer optimal combinations of pharmacologic and\nimmunological perturbagens that disrupt cancer cell and tumor microenvironment interaction\nand viability. Our approach is based on our preliminary data, which suggests that in each\nidentifiable oncogenic state there is a close interplay between activation of oncogenic elements,\ncellular pathways and the immune microenvironment. The project will test this approach with\nthree Specific Aims: Aim 1. Characterize 5-10 pan-cancer oncogenic states with well-defined\ngenomic and immune hallmarks including their specific molecular targets and sensitivity to\nperturbagens. Aim 2. Computationally infer optimal combinations of pharmacological and\nimmunological perturbagens. Aim 3. Experimentally validate single and combinations of\nperturbagens identified in Aim 2. This innovative approach will provide a rich source of CTD2\ndatasets and resources including a catalog of oncogenic states, their most salient genomic and\nimmune hallmarks, associated targets and validated combinations of pharmacologic and\nimmune therapies that are effective at targeting tumors. These results will lead directly to the\ndevelopment of clinical trials, novel treatment strategies and provide the foundation for a new\ngeneration of more comprehensive, functional-based, precision medicine approaches.\n \n 	Anatomy;Antibodies;Bayesian Method;Biological;Cancer Vaccines;Cancer cell line;Catalogs;Cell Survival;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Communities;Complex;Computer Simulation;Data;Data Set;Development;Elements;Epitopes;Foundations;Gene Expression;Generations;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Human;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immunologics;Immunotherapy;Knock-out;Lead;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Molecular Target;Mutation;Natural Killer Cells;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Pharmacology;Resistance;Resources;Signal Pathway;Solid Neoplasm;Source;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Treatment Efficacy;Xenograft procedure;anticancer research;base;cancer cell;cancer classification;cancer genome;chimeric antigen receptor;clinical development;immune checkpoint;innovation;mouse model;mutational status;new therapeutic target;novel;precision medicine;predictive modeling;response;synergism;targeted treatment;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO	LA JOLLA	CA	UNITED STATES	Ezra  Cohen,Dan S Kaufman,JILL P.

project	1U01CA223976-01A1	U01CA223976	9559835	2018	Biological Comparisons Among Three Derivative Models of Glioma Patient Cancers Under Microenvironmental Stress	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: \nCurrent methods of preclinical testing of potential therapeutics have been, for the most part, underwhelming in \nterms of their ability to yield a clinical impact. This is particularly true for glioblastoma (GBM) where prognosis \nhas increased only by 2-3 months over the last 75 years with a 5-year survival of less than 4%. Many promising \npreclinical studies have failed to live up to expectations when tested clinically. This problem is likely due to: a) \nlimitations of the preclinical model system and b) lack of reliable biomarkers for proper patient selection. To \naddress these issues, investigators are increasingly utilizing patient-­derived models of cancer (PDMC) coupled \nwith comprehensive molecular profiling. However, differences in model composition, growth conditions, and \nother microenvironmental factors limit reliability of these models and hamper interpretation. We believe that a \ncareful investigation of tumor microenvironmental (TME) stressors on 3 patient­derived models (xenolines) of \nGBM, namely xenografts (PDX), spheroid cultures (neurospheres), and human biomatrix embedded 3D \nmicrotumors, will provide insight into critical aspects of tumor biology that are influenced by model and TME. \nThese models pre­ and post­ TME perturbagen will also be comprehensively profiled at the genomic, \ntranscriptomic, and kinomic (global kinase activity assessment through a peptide substrate microarray) level to \ngenerate a similarity distance metric. We hypothesize that application of TME stressors to the PDMC’s will \nimprove both molecular and biological fidelity of the respective models to that of the original tumor or parent \nxenoline that can be visualized and in silico tested using an advanced computational data modeling system \n(GeneTerrain). Our preliminary data generated from prior NIH funded projects indicate that our existing xenolines \nrecapitulate all four molecular subtypes of GBM identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas while reproducing the \nkey hallmarks of GBM when implanted orthotopically in immunocompromised mice. Importantly, we can grow \ndisaggregated xenoline tumors in a novel three-dimensional (3D) culture system incorporating many cells of the \ntumor microenvironment to produce 3D microtumors suitable for higher throughput drug testing. Moreover, we \nhave preliminary evidence that TME manipulation of BTICs or 3D microtumors (e.g., hypoxia or nutrient \ndeprivation) promotes a more aggressive tumor phenotype in vitro and in vivo that is accompanied by changes \nin kinomic signatures. Therefore, we will: 1) Generate 3 PDMC models from existing xenolines as well as de \nnovo GBM patient tumors with comprehensive omic testing to calculate similarity distance metrics among the \nmodels with corresponding biological assessments including growth, chemoradiation sensitivity, and stemness \nmarkers;; 2) Perform TME perturbagen testing of the derivative PDMCs (neurospheres and 3D microtumors) and \ndetermine impact on tumor biology and similarity distance metric;; 3) Develop and validate GeneTerrain models \nof the various PDMCs with respect to TME and therapeutic sensitivity (radiation and temozolomide).

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in\nestablishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication\nbetween cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and\ntumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize\nmacrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific\nmetabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making\nArginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer\ncells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of\nmatched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of\ncancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie “microtumors”) and a unique dual recombinase\ngenetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with\ninhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition,\novercoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer\nmicroenvironment.

Despite\nsuccess in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC\ndemonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly\nunderstood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an\nimproved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will\nenable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future\nimmunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in\nPDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that\ntarget tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this\nproject, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic\nPDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will\nutilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at\nunprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy,\nradiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these\nstudies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional\nevaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3\nwe will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to\ninvestigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and\nimprove immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in\nPDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME\nand identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating\ndisease.

project	1U01CA224151-01	U01CA224151	9449680	2017	Canine Immuno Neurotherapeutics	Grant	ABSTRACT:\nThe dog is an ideal large animal model for diagnostic and therapeutic studies and can be used to translate\nsuccesses to human patients while providing compassionate care to animals and advancing the field of\nveterinary medicine. Pet dogs share their environment, and oftentimes their diet, with their owners. Dogs and\nhumans develop sporadic benign and malignant brain tumors at about the same rate and with similar\nhistopathology. Dogs are often euthanized due to the cost of care. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine\nbrain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people as well as pets through comparative\noncology and genomics and the “One Medicine” approach to research and direct clinical application. We propose\na multi-institutional consortium to test an innovative combinatorial immunotherapeutic approach in dogs that\nspontaneously and sporadically develop malignant glial brain tumors that resemble in most important aspects,\nhigh-grade malignant gliomas in humans. Our approach will inject a clinical grade oncolytic herpes simplex virus\n(HSV) M032 that expresses human interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the resected tumor bed. Dog lymphocytes fully\nrespond to human IL-12 [1] and oncolytic HSV infect and kill canine (as well as mouse, non-human primate,\nhuman) tumor cells, creating a potent local inflammatory response and an antigen-rich tumor cell debris field.\nTherefore, we would anticipate that this virally-based immunotherapeutic approach would likely be as effective\nin dogs with brain tumors as in humans with brain tumors. We will conduct longitudinal safety, survival and\ncorrelative biology evaluations as a means of assessing the dog as an appropriate and informative model for\ndesign and implementation of clinical studies in humans with high-grade malignant brain tumors. To extend these\nfindings, we propose, in subsequent studies, to combine the HSV immunotherapy approach with molecules that\nblock the action of innate checkpoint inhibitor(s). These studies are designed to address key issues of safety\nand efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy in the dog that can be translated to humans with malignant gliomas.\nMalignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in humans, accounting for 30% of all primary\ncentral nervous system (CNS) tumors in adults. [2] With few major advances in decades, there has been no\nsignificant reduction in mortality and only a modest improvement in median survival. Recently, objective\nresponses and long-term survivals have been observed in human glioma patients who have received oncolytic\nvirotherapy and a Phase I trial is currently underway at UAB in patients using M032 alone. New approaches to\nutilize checkpoint inhibitors promises improved efficacy, but the ability to develop more effective combinatorial\napproaches has been slow, in large part due to lack of a faithful model of spontaneous glioblastoma multiforme\n(GBM) in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal\nopportunity to improve the lives of people and pets through comparative oncology and genomics using the “One\nMedicine“ approach to research and direct clinical application.

project	1U01CA224153-01	U01CA224153	9449723	2017	Enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy in DLBCL using rational combination approaches	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nWhile small molecule inhibitors have made an impact in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL),\nimmunotherapy, specifically using anti-CD20 based approaches, has had the most profound effect on treatment\nstrategies and long-term outcomes. Despite this progress, up to 40% of patients will ultimately succumb to their\ndisease. Furthermore, even when treatment is successful, cytotoxic chemotherapy carries a high risk of long-\nterm morbidities that impact quality of life. The recent success of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint\ninhibitors in the setting of lymphoma demonstrates the potential for additional progress in long-term disease\ncontrol of DLBCL, with less toxicity. The molecular and genetic phenotype of canine DLBCL has been studied\nand it often resembles the activated B cell (ABC) category typically associated with aggressive DLBCL in people.\nMoreover, there is now substantial data that specific genetic changes and pathway aberrations are conserved\nacross dogs and people with DLBCL supporting the notion that the canine disease can be used as a relevant\nspontaneous large animal model of the human counterpart. Toward this end, the purpose of this proposal is to\nuse dogs with spontaneous naïve DLBCL to rapidly evaluate rational small molecule/immunotherapy\ncombination approaches, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most effective combination to move forward in\nhuman patients with DLBCL. Specifically, we hypothesize that optimal combinations of anti-CD20, anti-\nPD1, XPO1 inhibition, NAMPT/PAK4 and PI3Kdelta inhibition will have better outcomes than doxorubicin\nbased chemotherapy, resulting in a “chemo-free” blueprint for future human trials. Using an adaptive\nmini-pilot trial approach, those combinations deemed antagonistic and/or associated with unacceptable adverse\nevents can be rapidly removed from consideration, while those with clear therapeutic promise can be most\neffectively studied in the front-line setting and enhanced. We will accomplish this by first determining the optimal\nchemo-free regimen with small molecule/ anti-CD20 combinations, then identifying the optimal chemo-free\nregimen with small molecule/anti-PD1 combinations and finally, by evaluating a frontline chemo-free novel\ncombination regimen in canine DLBCL to demonstrate superiority to standard R-CHOP-based chemotherapy.\nAdditionally, we will interrogate correlative biomarkers based on RNA sequencing of tumor samples obtained\nfrom dogs enrolled into the prospective trials and develop signatures that can be used to predict not only\nresponse to therapy, but more importantly long-term progression-free survival. Together, the data generated\nfrom this proposal will create a framework for effectively leveraging information gained from integrated\nimmunotherapeutic trials in canine patients with DLBCL to develop chemo-free strategies that ultimately improve\nhuman outcomes.

In the field of immunotherapy, dogs offer an innovative model for translational research, as they\npresent many of the challenges faced in “scaling up” therapeutic systems dependent on complex interactions\nbetween multiple cell types yet under more controlled settings. They also allow for long-term assessment of\nefficacy and toxicities. Canine clinical trials offer unique access to a rich source of spontaneously occurring,\ngenetically and immunologically diverse cancers with the benefits of reduced time, expense, and regulatory\nhurdles of a human trial. The similarities between canine and human cancers are increasingly being realized.\nThe publicly available canine genome has propelled comparative genomics studies that have shown significant\nhomology between dogs and humans for recognized cancer-associated genes including MET, IGF1R, mTOR,\nand KIT. Not surprisingly, cytogenetic abnormalities that define human cancers, i.e. BCR-Abl translocations in\nchronic myelogenous leukemia and RB1 deletions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been found in\ncomparable canine cancers. Intracranial neoplasia occurs frequently in dogs with a reported prevalence from\n0.15 to 4.5% compared to 18.2 cases per 100,000 human. Astrocytoma or glioma account for 20-36% of\nprimary brain tumors in dogs and 25% in humans. Brachycephalic breeds such as Boxers, French and English\nbulldogs, and Boston terriers have a significantly increased risk of developing gliomas. Primary canine brain\ntumors have similar histologic classification as those reported by the World Health Organization for human\nbrain tumors. Similar to that in humans, the prognosis for dogs with brain tumors in general is poor regardless\nof therapeutic intervention. However, much less is known about canine glioma treatment outcomes because\nonly a small number of studies with few dogs have been reported. There is little information about median\nsurvival time for dogs with glioma that received any type of treatment, but estimates of days to 2 or 3 months\nare often given to owners. The clinical similarities between dogs and humans suggest that dogs may represent\nan outstanding model for testing targeted therapies; both dogs and humans might benefit from these studies.\nHerein, we are proposing a multi-pronged immunotherapeutic approach to improve efficacy and survival times.\nWe hypothesize that combination immunotherapy in a canine glioma model will enhance efficacy and\naccelerate successful translation into phase I human trials for GBM. The objective is to use pet dogs with\nspontaneous GBM to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of combination immunotherapy. We propose two\nSpecific Aims: 1. Determine the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in spontaneous\ncanine GBM in combination with standard of care, and 2. Assess the efficacy of immune-mediated gene\ntherapy in combination with CD200 blockade to enhance anti-glioma immunotherapy.\n!

This work is targeted to dogs with typically lethal, naturally occurring osteosarcoma (OSA)\nand melanoma, and the findings are expected to have important relevance for the design and translation of\ninnovative immunotherapy approaches in humans. Inhaled (IH) IL-15 offers the advantages of local delivery of\nthis immune-stimulatory cytokine, while limiting systemic exposure and thus potential toxicity. Super-agonist IL-\n15 offers increased half-life and greater anti-tumor effects. Therefore, each of these cytokines is anticipated to\nalter the risk/benefit ratio in favor of their use. To accomplish these objectives, we propose the following three\nspecific aims: 1) Targeting gross pulmonary metastases (OSA and melanoma) with first-in-dog delivery of\ninhaled (IH) human IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15; 2) Phase II trial of IH IL-15 and autologous NK cells to treat\ngross OSA and melanoma pulmonary metastases, and; 3) Targeting micro-metastatic disease using super-\nagonist IL-15 in primary OSA. The canine model represents a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy research\nas an important link between murine models and human clinical studies. Dogs represent an attractive outbred\ncombination of companion animals that experience spontaneous cancer development in the setting of an intact\nimmune system. Importantly, these studies are designed to evaluate novel treatment combinations for\nadvanced pulmonary metastases in the setting of gross disease, but also will determine the impact of this\napproach as first-line therapy when combined with standard-of-care treatments. Moreover, this work seeks to\nelucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate an anti-tumor response (or non-response) in\ndogs with naturally occurring cancers. We will have the unique opportunity to perform whole exome\nsequencing and RNASeq on tumor tissue pre- and post-immunotherapy, and we will investigate whether a\nsignature of mutational landscape and gene expression profiles can be developed to prospectively predict\noutcome and response to immune therapies. We will correlate these data to immunohistochemical, flow\ncytometry, and serum cytokine readouts for evidence of transition from “cold” to “hot” tumors predictive of\nfavorable long term outcome. Hence, these canine trials and bio-marker studies represent an ideal strategy to\ninform and facilitate the rapid translation of novel, potentially high impact immune therapies to human patients\nwith aggressive cancers.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic\nresponse, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to\npresumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking.\n3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme\noutcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular\nimmunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term\nsurvivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and\nthat long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this\nproposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment-\nspecific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can\nneoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue\nand blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy.\nThe proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies – a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to\nidentify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific\nmodulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic\nPDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating\nexosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation\nsequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen\ndiscovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of\nneoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of\nhighly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill\nCornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute\nfor Advanced Study. This initiative is directly relevant to the primary objective to develop novel biomarkers and\nT cell antigenic targets for the successful application of immunotherapy in PDAC.

Indeed, canine OS has historically been used to help develop\nnovel limb spare techniques, evaluate a variety of non-specific immunotherapeutics such as L-MTP-PE, and\nassess the efficacy of targeted therapeutics to prevent the outgrowth of metastatic disease. Despite best efforts,\nprogress in the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease has essentially stalled for the past 3 decades;\n30% of people and 90% of dogs still die of tumor spread, primarily to the lungs. Numerous clinical trials have\nbeen undertaken in people with macroscopic metastases and in dogs with both microscopic and macroscopic\ndisease, yet all have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes. This is particularly evident with respect to\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors that do not induce the dramatic disease regressions typically observed in other\ncancers such as melanoma and lung cancer. One particularly daunting challenge for immunotherapy-based\ntherapeutics in OS relates to the permissiveness of the tumor microenvironment (TME) for inducing anti-tumor\nimmune responses. Our data suggests that a relatively low mutational load combined with a dampened overall\nimmune response in OS may contribute to the observed lack of response to current treatment approaches. We\npropose that targeting the immune suppressive TME in OS is essential to generating potent and durable anti-\ntumor immunity. To accomplish this, it may be necessary to simultaneously modulate several elements in the\nTME, including Tregs, MDSCs, M2 macrophages and overexpressed inhibitory checkpoint molecules. In support\nof this, we have generated a body of data demonstrating immunological activity of multiple therapeutics, including\nrepurposed drugs with good safety records (losartan, oclacitinib), small molecule inhibitors with established\nPK/PD in dogs (toceranib, RV1001, reparixin, JHU-292) and antibodies specific for checkpoint molecules (anti-\nPD1). However, the exact combinations that are most effective against metastatic OS have not yet been\nidentified, and this is a major goal of this proposal. As such, we hypothesize that an adaptive pilot trial design\ncan be used to rapidly screen TME-targeting immunotherapy drug combinations in dogs with\nmacroscopic chemotherapy-resistant metastatic OS and that this information can be refined to assess\nactivity of the most active approach against microscopic metastases in a subsequent adjuvant trial. This\nwill be accomplished by testing four TME modifying immunotherapy combinations for anti-tumor and immune\nmodulatory activity in dogs with macroscopic OS metastases, interrogating relevant biomarkers associated with\nresponses to therapy, then using this information to conduct an adjuvant immunotherapy trial with the most active\ncombination in dogs with microscopic metastatic OS. The data generated from this proposal will create a\nblueprint for future immunotherapy studies in people with OS by eliminating approaches deemed inactive\nand generating a set of clinical biomarkers to guide treatment.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this\ncomplex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the\nprohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water,\ndense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and\npro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this\nproject has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several\nhighly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and\ninteractions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote\nthe survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that\nsignificantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also\nthe three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In\nthe following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and\nmyeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will\npursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and\nmitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic\nallografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).

project	1U01CA224348-01	U01CA224348	9457862	2017	Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy	Grant	We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n(PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan,\ncan enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS\n2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include “normalization” of cancer-associated\nfibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and\ndecreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at\nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy – FOLFIRINOX and\nthen chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this\ntrial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to\nresectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably,\ntranscriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only\nnormalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity\ninvolving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the\nPDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in\ncombination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive\nPDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs\nand cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had\nlimited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover\nhow losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood\nvessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug-\ninduced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically\nengineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment\nreprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on\nour preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our\nbench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will\npositively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have\na 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the\nknowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment\nin PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium. Through this work, we will develop innovative\napproaches to enhance anti-tumor immunity in this intractable disease.

project	1U01CA224766-01	U01CA224766	9471276	2018	Protective Role of Nonclassical Monocytes in Immunotherapies for Solid Cancers	Grant	Nonclassical monocytes (identified as CD14dimCD16+ in humans) exhibit a unique ability to `patrol' or survey\nthe luminal side of the vascular endothelium both at steady state and during inflammation. Nonclassical\nmonocytes function in circulation to aid in removing pathogens and debris from the vasculature. We recently\nfound that nonclassical monocytes function in the vasculature to prevent tumor metastasis by orchestrating\nthe killing and clearance of metastasizing tumor cells. The anti-tumor immune potential of nonclassical\npatrolling monocytes is in contrast to the growing evidence for pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic functions\nof myeloid cells in many tumor types. In the current proposal, we hypothesize that nonclassical monocytes\nfunction in an anti-tumoral manner to support CAR T cell expansion and efficacy in patients with solid\ntumors. Thus, one major goal of our proposal is to determine whether monocyte therapy using anti-tumoral\nnonclassical monocytes in combination with existing CAR T immunotherapy would improve efficacy. We will\nuse mass cytometry to study monocyte subsets in cancer patients to identify new markers that will help\nreadily determine how successful a proposed immunotherapy may be for patients. Aim 1 will identify unique\nmarkers of nonclassical monocytes in multiply relapsed sarcoma patients versus healthy subjects using\nmass cytometry. Aim 1 will be performed using banked samples from the existing GD2 CAR T trial at the\nNIH Clinical Center. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that nonclassical monocytes play a functional role in\npromoting anti-tumor immunity when used in combination with immunotherapy for solid tumor metastasis.\nAim 2 will use both xenografted humanized mouse and syngeneic mouse tumor models. Aim 3 will study\nthe safety and preliminary efficacy of CAR T cell immunotherapy in combination with nonclassical monocyte\ncell therapy for patients with multiple relapsed, metastatic or progressive pediatric solid tumors. In Aim 3, we\nwill initiate a second generation GD2 CAR T cell trial for multiply relapsed patients with osteosarcoma and\nneuroblastoma. Given the potential anti-tumor efficacy of patrolling monocytes we plan to initiate an early\nphase clinical trial delivering nonclassical monocytes alone and in combination with CAR T cell therapy as\npart of this trial. There are 3 investigators in this project: one extramural, one intramural at NCI, and one at\nthe NIH Clinical Center. From the results of this proposal, we will achieve significant insight into the roles of\nvarious myeloid cell subpopulations on promoting and inhibiting the anti-tumoral responses of CAR T cell\ntherapies for solid tumors. We are uniquely poised as a research team to directly address the role of\nmonocytes and other myeloid cells in interacting with CAR T cells in human patients. The findings of our\nresearch team will significantly advance the knowledge that will lead to effective CAR T cell therapy for solid\ntumors. As similar interactions of monocytes occur with T cells that are modulated by checkpoint inhibitor\ntrials, we anticipate that our findings will shed insight into monocyte:T cell interactions in the context of\ncheckpoint inhibition therapy.

LS SCLC has less than a 25% 5-year overall survival (OS) and ultimately a\nstrategy for improving long-term SCLC outcomes needs to successfully target tumor cell populations that\nsurvive standard therapy and give rise to recurrent disease. There is, however, a considerable gap in\nunderstanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiotherapy resistance in SCLC. Our project is\nunique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on\nchemoradioresistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient-\nderived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate mechanisms of therapy\nresistance. This approach was remarkably successful, identifying a tolerable and strongly synergistic anti-\nSCLC interaction that led to a CTEP-approved trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070; Study Chair:\nHann). In this research program, we will test key hypotheses via three specific aims that will provide more\nmechanistic insights into the rapidly emergent chemoradiation resistance observed in LS SCLC.\nOne central hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive gene expression changes mediate rapid emergence of\nthe chemoradiation resistance phenotype in LS SCLC. We have developed a novel chemoradiation treatment\nregimen with SCLC PDX models to facilitate these studies. Development and characterization of this novel\nmodel involves a unique collaboration between medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, bioinformaticians,\nmedical physicists, veterinarians and molecular/cell biologists that is extremely well suited to develop an\nintegrated program dedicated to resolving questions of SCLC chemoradioresistance. Finally, we have already\nidentified novel gene targets that are correlated with SCLC chemoradioresistance.\nOur research program is organized as follows: Aim #1: Characterize natural history of response of\nexperimental models of SCLC to chemoradiation in vivo. We will determine response rates and recurrence\npatterns of a panel of SCLC PDXs and transgenic mouse models. Aim #2: Characterization of molecular\nunderpinnings of SCLC chemoradiation resistance. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks and gene\nexpression profiles associated with chemoradiation resistance and develop small-scale predictive classifiers for\ntherapy response to be validated in follow-up studies. Aim #3: Pharmacologic and genetic validation of\ncandidate genes for SCLC chemoradiation resistance in vitro and in vivo. We will validate our novel gene\ncandidates for conferring chemoradiation resistance using pharmacologic and genetic approach with SCLC\nPDX-derived organoids and SCLC transgenic mouse models.

One of the most successful therapies is chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR) that\ntarget the CD19 protein on the surface of leukemia. Landmark clinical trials led by our group\ndemonstrated unparalleled efficacy in relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n(ALL), with complete remission rates in excess of 80%, resulting in the first ever FDA approval\nof a gene modified cell therapy (Kymriah, tisagenlecleucel). There is a great need to develop\nCAR therapies for other pediatric cancers, and we face many challenges to achieve the same\nlevel of success in solid tumors and lymphoma.\nPrimary among these challenges is the difficulty in collecting healthy T cells from pediatric\ncancer patients. Our experience not only treating the most children in the world with CAR\ntherapy but also getting the most referrals gave us insight into the difficulty of getting healthy T\ncells from children with cancer. We have identified two main problems: dysfunction in T cells\nfrom children with solid tumors present at diagnosis and progressive difficulty getting functional\nT cells after intensive chemotherapy. As we have investigated these problems, we learned how\nfortunate we were with pediatric ALL, a patient group that has proven to have T cells uniquely\nwell preserved for CAR therapy generation.\nThis project seeks to identify the mechanisms of dysfunction in T cells from pediatric cancer\npatients both before and after chemotherapy, and reverse them to enable the generation of\nhighly active CAR T cell therapies for cancers other than ALL. Our preliminary data indicates\nthat Naïve T cells are the key starting material for successful CAR T cell generation in\npediatrics, and that in their absence preserving Naïve-like function during CAR manufacture can\nsubstitute. Metabolic pathways are key in the transitions from Naïve to memory and effector\nstates, and these feed into the energy reserve of a T cell as measured by its mitochondrial\npotential. Our research plan centers on manipulating metabolic pathways and restoring\nmitochondrial respiratory capacity to T cells from pediatric cancer patients. This will enable the\nhigh level of proliferative capacity required for effective CAR therapy as we develop new targets\nwithin the Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery and Development Network. Our work will support\nthe discovery efforts of the PI-DDN by developing the specialized T cell manufacturing required\nfor these difficult to treat cancers.

These studies have broad relevance for pediatric leukemias given dependencies of numerous\nAML and ALL subtypes upon critical oncogenic cytokine receptor signaling pathways and the demonstrated\nclinical efficacy of cellular immunotherapies in children with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. In this proposal, we aim\nto develop combinatorial CAR approaches targeting (1) the TSLP receptor plus CD19 and/or CD22 to improve\nremission induction and longevity in Ph-like B-ALL, (2) the FLT3 receptor plus CD19 and/or CD22 to improve\nremission induction and longevity in KMT2A-rearranged B-ALL, and (3) the FLT3 receptor and CD33 to\nimprove remission induction and longevity in FLT3-mutant AML. The overall goal of these studies is to identify\nsuccessful combinatorial immunotherapeutic approaches to mitigate now-known resistance mechanisms of\nkinase signaling and antigen escape that are imminently translatable to the clinic for early-phase testing in\nchildren with high-risk acute leukemias.

Mounting evidence has shown that immunotherapies through\nstrengthening the amplitude and quality of T cell-mediated adaptive response may mediate durable and even\ncomplete tumor regression in some cancer patients. Two of the most promising approaches to enhance thera-\npeutic anti-tumor immunity are immune checkpoint blockade using monoclonal antibodies against PD-1/PD-L1\nand CTLA-4, and adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) or peripheral T cells that\nare genetically engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). However, functional and effective effector\nT cells require metabolically rewiring T cells to meet their anabolic and energy demands. A critical barrier for\nimmunotherapy is the hostile metabolic microenvironment within solid tumors, where the highly metabolic-\ndemanding tumor cells compromise the function of T cells by competing for glucose. In addition, tumor cells\nalso release immune suppressive metabolite, adenosine into the extracellular space. While recent advances\nhave helped determine the metabolic reprogramming of T cell activation and its regulatory signaling mecha-\nnism, the detailed landscape of metabolic programs in active T cells and the impact of the tumor’s metabolic\nmicroenvironment on the development and anti-tumor immune function of cytotoxic T effector (Teff) cells re-\nmains elusive. Our studies have shown that glucose restriction significantly dampened the growth and tumor-\nkilling activities of Teff cells. We further identified inosine as a potent metabolite that could replace glucose in\npromoting Teff cells growth and tumor-killing activities. Using inosine as the alterative metabolic substrate indi-\ncates a layer of metabolic plasticity on T cells and further implicates the potential of inosine in relieving tumor-\nimposed metabolic restrictions on T cells in vivo. However, stressed or damaged tumor cells release adeno-\nsine, an immediate metabolic precursor of inosine into the extracellular space to suppress Teff cells, shaping\nthe efficacy and magnitude of anti-tumor immune response. Hence, we hypothesize that reprogramming of\nthe adenosine-inosine metabolic axis can maximize anti-tumor immune response in treating pediatric\nsolid tumors. To test our hypothesis, we propose to 1) decipher inosine catabolic pathways and to assess the\nimpact of key metabolic steps on Teff cells; 2) develop and test inosine modulation strategies to enhance im-\nmunotherapy; and 3) develop strategies to reprogram tumor metabolic microenvironment and maximize sys-\ntemic anti-tumor immunity We propose taking the first step in testing the metabolic modulation of Teff cells to\nrelieve the metabolic barriers imposed by the tumor’s microenvironment. Our studies will have profound effects\non the field of cancer immunotherapy and substantially improve clinical outcomes of pediatric cancer patients.\nThe insights generated from this study will reveal fundamental principles of the emerging connections between\nthe tumor’s microenvironment, cell metabolism, and anti-tumor immunity.

The project detailed here commences with the selection and careful\ncharacterization of a dozen fully human antibodies to Glypican-2, the most promising antigen in\nneuroblastoma, from a pre-existing hybridoma stock. These antibodies, along with their full\nsequences, binding affinities, cellular internalization, epitope, and (where possible) crystal structures,\nwill be made available to Consortium members within the first year for use in their modality of choice.\nThis project will explore their utility as components in double bispecific antibody therapy: this double\nbispecific approach targets two cancer antigens and two T cell receptors simultaneously, inducing T\ncell activation and co-activation only in the presence of cancer cells expressing both antigens. The\ndouble targeting strategy should allow for a much higher level of selective engagement and killing\nthan has heretofore been possible with therapies that target only a single cancer antigen, and should\nit prove effective in neuroblastoma the approach is likely to have utility in a wide variety of cancers.\nOne historical weakness for the development of immuno-oncology approaches such as this one is\nthat the animal models have had very little predictive value. For this reason, the best of the\nhumanized mouse models, “MISTRG” mice, will be used both for the development of these molecules\nand for testing the other consortium members’ approaches, where they could be useful. CIVO multi-\nneedle array technology will be employed to simplify the combinatorial challenge associated with\ntesting pairs of bispecific molecules; this technology will also be open for use collaboratively with the\nother Consortium members. In short, the proposal provides the Consortium with human antibodies\nagainst a validated neuroblastoma target, access to the current state-of-the-art in humanized mice, a\nCIVO multi-needle array device to facilitate testing therapeutics, and a double bispecific antibody\ntherapeutic approach that promises a high level of T cell killing and selectivity and a likely broad\napplicability beyond neuroblastoma.

project	1U01CA232491-01	U01CA232491	9616585	2018	Dual targeting of tumoral microenvironment and tumoral cells by blocking the IL-33/ST2 pathway	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: A fundamental gap exists in our knowledge of the immunologic tumoral\nmicroenvironment during the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other deadly childhood\ncancers. Bridging of this gap could lead to novel immunotherapies. Our long-term goals are to develop novel\nimmunotherapies for leukemia and pediatric solid tumors. Our objective in this application is to investigate the\nrole of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing Stimulation-2 (ST2), the IL-33 receptor in the\nmicroenvironment as well as ST2 on tumoral cells. Our central hypothesis is that we can target the tumoral\nmicroenvironment and tumoral cells by blocking the IL-33/ST2 pathway with neutralizing and bispecific\nantibodies that we will develop. This hypothesis was formed based on our unpublished preliminary data\nshowing that: First, nonmalignant mice deficient in T-bet have elevated numbers of BM-infiltrating ST2+ Tregs\ncompared to wild-type (WT) mice (45% vs 25%, respectively), suggesting reciprocal roles of ST2/IL33 and T-\nbet/interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in Tregs from the BM niche. Second, we observed 10-fold more Tregs expressing\nsignificantly more activation markers in the BM niche of AML-bearing mice than in the nonmalignant niche.\nThird, MLL-AF9 AML cell proliferation was significantly lower in mice receiving donor syngeneic ST2 knock-out\n(ST2-/-) T cells than in mice receiving donor syngeneic WT T cells (2% vs 17%, respectively). ST2 blockade\nalso decreased Treg activation (i.e., KLRG1) and increased type 1 signaling in CD8+ T cells as well as\ndecreased their exhaustion, suggesting restoration of an antitumoral response in ST2-/- mice. The rationale for\nthis study is that once we are able to understand the biology of the immunological microenvironment in the\nmalignant niche, we can propose personalized treatment plans to block the tolerogenic pathways. Similarly,\nunderstanding the biology responsible for the overexpression of ST2/IL-33 on the tumoral cell, will help target\nthis pathway. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Explore ST2 and IL-33 expression on\ntumoral cells and in the tumoral microenvironment from liquid and solid childhood cancers in human and mice;\n2) Examine whether ST2/IL-33 blockade can impact tumor immunity in the malignant BM niche and solid tumor\nmicroenvironment as a proof-of-principle of a novel antitumoral immunotherapy; and 3) Optimizing anti-ST2\nneutralizing antibodies against murine and human targets for translational purpose. This approach is innovative\nbecause, to our knowledge, the function of ST2+ Tregs in the malignant microenvironment, remains virtually\nunexplored. It will also provide biological insights into the nature of ST2+ Tregs and ST2+ tumoral cells in the\nmicroenvironment and determine whether their blockade can restore antitumoral activity and decrease tumoral\nproliferation via a dual mechanism. The proposed research is significant because novel antitumoral\nimmunotherapies that are more targeted and less toxic than classical chemotherapy/irradiation regimens are\nneeded.

These successes culminated in the recent FDA\napproval of bi-specific T-cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-armed T-cells for B-cell acute\nlymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, relapses frequently occur in patients treated with CD19-\ndirected immunotherapies, often due to epitope loss. While strategies based on dual antigen targeting are\nbeginning to emerge, they are still based on targeting canonical B-cell markers, with the unavoidable side\neffect of total ablation of normal B-cells. The apparent paucity of tumor-specific targets in pediatric cancers\n(including leukemias) is likely to limit future immunotherapies. We hypothesize that alternative splicing\ncould be both a mechanism of epitope loss and a rich source of a neo-antigens in B-ALL. Indeed, using\ncomputational and biochemical approaches, we have identified hundreds of local splicing variations\n(LSVs), mapping to transmembrane proteins (e.g., CD19 and CD22) with prominent extracellular domains\n(ectodomains). In fact, in our prior work we described a mechanism of acquired resistance to CART-19\nbased on selective loss of the CD19 ectodomain, primarily through exon 2 skipping. The two large Aims of\nthis U01 are as follows. Aim 1: To identify programs and determinants of altered splicing of B-ALL cell\nsurface antigens. Our overarching goal is to construct a dedicated “splicing code” for leukemic B-cells. Such\na code will predict cis-acting genetic variants as well as trans-acting factors involved in alternative splicing\nand allow us to identify all alternatively spliced ectodomains. Then in Aim 2, we will investigate the effects\nof alternative splicing on B-ALL immunotherapy. Using CD22 as just one example, we will determine how\ntruncated protein isoforms confer resistance to CD22-targeting immunotherapeutics, including antibody-\ndrug conjugates such as inotuzumab ozogamicin, which was recently approved by FDA to treat relapsed or\nrefractory B-ALL. We will also raise antibodies against peptides spanning novel exon junctions, generate\nantibody-drug conjugates, and test their efficacy against B-ALL cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In\nsummary, this leukemia-based U01 will create new computational and conceptual frameworks, which\nwould be highly synergistic with Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery & Development Network (PI-DDN)\noverall goals, including identification of antigenic epitopes that are uniquely expressed on childhood\ncancers and of cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion.

TFH cells are crucial for the formation of germinal centers and\nhumoral responses, and our new data show that TFH cells become the main producers of\nCXCL13 and TNFS14/LIGHT upon vaccination. The assembly and maintenance of TLS should\nbe therefore dependent on TFH responses. Our new data demonstrate that Special AT-rich\nsequence-binding protein-1 (Satb1) ablation specifically in T cells leads to enhanced TFH\ndifferentiation and augmented Ag-specific humoral responses, which is associated with\nconcurrent ICOS and PD-1 de-repression. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that\nLIGHT+CXCL13+ TFH cell formation and, subsequently, the orchestration of TLS in cancer, is\ngoverned by Satb1 silencing in CD4 T cells by both de-repressing ICOS in TFH cells and\nsuppressing Foxp3+PD-1highCXCR5+ T follicular regulatory (TFR) cell formation through PD-1\nup-regulation. Therefore, TGF-β paradoxically enhances the generation of TFH cells and the\nformation of TLS through Satb1 repression.\n In Aim 1, we will define the role of SATB1-dependent ICOS expression during TFH\ndifferentiation. Through ChIP-PCR and functional analysis of Satb1-competent vs. Satb1-\ndeficient T cells in vivo, we will substantiate a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby the master\ngenomic organizer Satb1 governs ICOS expression, leading to enhanced TFH differentiation in\nthe absence of Satb1.\n In Aim 2, we will determine the role of SATB1 in TGF-β-driven, Treg-dependent TFH\ndifferentiation. Here, we will combine geentic manipulation and existing transgenic models to\nestablish to what extent the mechanism of TGF-β-driven TFH differentiation is Satb1- and PD-1-\ndependent, in a manner that requires decreased TFR formation.\n In Aim 3, we will recapitulate the mechanisms leading to the formation and protective activity\nof TLS in vivo in ovarian cancer. By leveraging unique transgenic models, our ovarian cancer-\nspecific CAR T cells and our viable single-cell suspensions from freshly dissociated ovarian\ncarcinomas, we will define a novel TGF-β → Satb1 silencing → TFH cell formation axis driving\nrelevant anti-tumor humoral responses.\n Our work will exert a profound effect in the field by elucidating how epigenetic programs\ncontrolled by SATB1 govern the generation of TFH cells at tumor beds in a TGF-β-dependent\nmanner. Recapitulating these mechanisms in vivo will pave the way for more effective\nimmunotherapies aimed to promote combined humoral and T cell responses through the\norchestration of TLS in irresectable/metastatic tumors, and could lead to the identification of\nantibodies with anti-tumor activity spontaneously produced at tumor beds.

Current practice guidelines from ACMG provide\nreferral indications for cancer predisposition assessment. Identifying patients with high genetic risk for breast,\novary, colon, or other cancers has important clinical ramifications for an individual's healthcare, but genetic risk\nif often not identified because of testing barriers at several levels. Barriers at the provider level include\ninadequacies in risk recognition, patient referrals and availability of genetic professionals to provide counseling\nin a traditional testing paradigm. Barriers at the level of the patient include poor understanding of the\navailability and benefits of testing and inadequate access to testing services. How to best implement\nappropriate genomic testing and follow-up care into an operating healthcare system is not known. Issues of\ncommunication, clinical flow, reportable actions, and transmission of information and support are of critical\nimportance, and must change and grow to accommodate the new information contained within genomic\ntesting. Studies to date of the implementation process have been conducted in high resourced facilities, under\noptimal conditions, often not at the system level. Aims include:\n1. Compare the efficacy and implementation of two strategies for identifying members of a primary care clinic's\npopulation who have a family or personal history of cancer and offering high-risk individuals to obtain genetic\ntesting for cancer susceptibility mutations in a randomized trial. The two methods are: 1) Point of Care (POC)\napproach: A tablet-based screening for family/personal history of cancer will be offered to all patients aged 25-\n65 coming in for a routine appointment at the clinic. 2) Direct Patient Engagement (DPE): Letters will be sent to\nall individuals aged 25-65 in a clinic's population, inviting them to visit a web site for screening for family\n/personal history of cancer. In both strategies, those determined to be high-risk will receive online education\nabout genetic testing and an invitation to obtain such testing through a web-based platform. Outcomes will be\nthe fraction of the active clinic patient population that completes screening and the fraction of the active clinic\npatient population that undergoes testing.\n2. Identify changes, problems, and inefficiencies in clinical flow and interactions during and after the\nimplementation of genomic testing for cancer risk across primary care clinics.\n3. Evaluate the effects of two methods of implementation of genomic screening for cancer risk on patient,\nprovider, and health system leader reports of benefits and harms, satisfaction, perceived quality of care,\nincluding across gender, racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and genetic literacy divides.\n4. Evaluate the value (cost-effectiveness) and affordability (budget impact) of each screening strategy.

The paradigm was developed based on the principle that\ngenetic testing was expensive and that the incidence of these syndromes was low. Over the past twenty years\nthe price of testing has fallen dramatically and it is now recognized that both HBOC and Lynch syndrome are\nrelatively common (joint incidence of about 1 in 200). Many individuals in the population are affected by HBOC\nor Lynch but come from small families with few female relatives. Given the decreases in family size that have\noccurred over the past 50 years this is becoming a common situation. It is estimated that only 20% of those\naffected by HBOC are aware of their condition. Overall, there is a significant unmet need for those with HBOC\nand Lynch syndrome to be identified so they can have the opportunity for appropriate medical care.\nWhat we need are approaches that can rapidly, accurately, and inexpensively identify those with inherited\ncancer syndromes. The costs of sequencing have fallen dramatically and members of our team have QIAseq\nbased targeted resequencing platforms for germline studies that dramatically lower the cost of panel based\nsequencing while allowing easy, rapid multiplexing. The costs of testing will be near $90 per sample. We have\ntaken the task of developing a strategy that can be applied to detect HBOC and Lynch syndromes in broader\npopulations.\nWe will study the effectiveness of population scale testing of these two syndromes by enrolling 27,500\nindividuals, who are (a) eligible for inherited cancer syndrome testing (2,500) (b) have had cancer but are not\ncovered by current screening guidelines to receive a low cost genetic screen (7,500) or (c) healthy (17,500).\nThose individuals identified to have Lynch or HBOC will be followed for outcomes and compared to a matched\ncohort identified following standard screening guidelines. Additionally, relatives of those identified will be\nenrolled in cascade screening. We will determine if testing either cancer patients or the general population\nrepresents a sustainable strategy for population screening based on QALY measurements.

Strategies to assess the genetic risk of unaffected individuals are needed. Scalable and\nsustainable methods to automatically extract and analyze family history information routinely captured in the\nelectronic health record (EHR) can identify primary care patients appropriate for cancer genetic services.\nIncreased patient ascertainment needs to be paired with implementation studies to compare models of\ndelivering genetic services, including patient-directed models. Because access to services continues to be a\nbarrier for those from minority racial and ethnic groups and rural areas, examining responses to different\ndelivery models across population subgroups is essential. This study will employ an implementation science\nframework to test a replicable EHR-based clinical decision support (CDS) infrastructure to: (i) automatically\nidentify unaffected patients from 48 primary care clinics in two healthcare systems, University of Utah and New\nYork University, who qualify for cancer genetic services (Aim 1); and (ii) compare two models of genetic\nservices delivery for 1,920 primary care patients using a randomized trial design with clinic-level randomization\n(Aims 2 and 3). We hypothesize that the CDS infrastructure will identify additional patients who have not been\npreviously referred (Aim 1) and that uptake of genetic testing (Aim 2) and adherence to management\nrecommendations (Aim 3) will be equivalent between the models. To address Aim 1, we will evaluate whether\nthe CDS approach identifies patients who have not previously been referred, and whether this varies by\nrace/ethnicity and rurality. To address Aim 2, we will compare: a patient-directed model in which those\nidentified by the CDS infrastructure as meeting testing criteria will be informed of their cancer risks, provided\nwith educational resources, and offered the option to select genetic testing through a patient portal to an\nenhanced standard of care model in which providers and patients are notified through CDS when criteria are\nmet and of the availability of standard of care genetic counseling. We will compare uptake of genetic testing by\nmodel and whether this differs by race/ethnicity and rurality. In Aim 3, we will compare the effects of the two\ndelivery models on adherence to recommendations 12 months after return of results, examining differences in\neffects by race/ethnicity and rurality. Innovative features include implementation of population-based CDS\nassessment of family history information available in the EHR; comparison of outcomes of patient-directed and\nenhanced standard of care delivery models; and focus on impact of race/ethnicity and rurality. This highly\nimpactful translational research builds on our unique strengths in cancer genetics, clinical informatics, and\npopulation sciences, and addresses issues of immediate clinical significance, including increasing hereditary\ncancer genetic testing in appropriate patients and improving access for underserved groups.

Barriers to testing, at both the patient and provider levels, include gaps in knowledge and poor\naccess to specialty genetics services. This multiphase project seeks to employ practice-level and patient-level\ninterventions to increase the proportion of patients in whom family history is documented and assessed for\ngenetic risk and in whom guideline-concordant genetic evaluation is completed. This proposal leverages\nexisting partnerships between a statewide oncology network, public health agencies, payers, and a\nmultidisciplinary team at the University of Michigan to encourage systematic family history ascertainment and\ngenetic risk assessment among newly-diagnosed cancer patients cared for in 68 medical and gyn-oncology\npractices. In partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and a network of nearly\nall oncology practices in Michigan, the Michigan Oncology Quality Consortium, we will deploy interventions to\npromote collection and assessment of family history and genetic evaluations for eligible patients with breast,\ncolorectal, ovarian, prostate and endometrial cancer cared for in diverse clinical and geographic settings\nacross the state. The first Specific Aim is to test the impact of innovative practice-based interventions on the\nproportion of patients who have a comprehensive family history documented in their medical record. In the first\nphase, using a stepped-wedge design, we will provide a tablet-based family health history survey tool to\npractices and evaluate the impact of the tool on quality measures of family history documentation and guideline\nconcordant genetic referrals. In the second phase, at Year 4, we will test the impact of adding value-based\nreimbursement using family history ascertainment as the quality improvement metric. The second Specific Aim\nis to evaluate the impact of two behavioral interventions (tailored messaging via mobile optimized web\ninterface vs genetic counseling using motivational interviewing) on uptake of genetic testing among patients\nwith cancer who meet clinical criteria and disclosure of genetic test results to at-risk relatives. Our third Specific\nAim addresses longitudinal follow up of cancer patients, exploring uptake of cascade genetic testing in families\nwith germline mutations. These projects directly address implementation and dissemination of genomic\nmedicine in diverse settings and will leverage both new and well-established partnerships among community\nand academic oncology practices, public health agencies, and payers in the state of Michigan. The University\nof Michigan is a leader in genomic medicine, behavioral interventions with diverse populations, healthcare\npolicy, and implementation science, and the proposed work engages multidisciplinary expertise in caring for a\ndiverse patient population and developing sustainable and scalable approaches for precision oncology in\ndiverse healthcare settings.

Innovations in bioinformatic technology hold great promise in overcoming\nmany of these barriers, particularly with the development of FHH applications that collect and analyze family\ndata, and SMART-on-FHIR capabilities that can integrate third party apps with the EMR. MeTree, a patient\nfacing risk assessment platform for 23 hereditary cancer syndromes with integrated education and evidence-\nbased clinical decision support, is one such platform that served as the backbone of the Implementing\nGenomics in Practice (IGNITE) network's FHH clinical utility study, where it demonstrated improvements in the\nidentification of those at risk, yet, also highlighted ongoing challenges particularly around undergoing genetic\ncounseling and testing, and awareness of risk. We submit that these barriers can be overcome and that we\ncan significantly improve identification and management of those at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes by\nbringing together a single clinical care platform that contains: a patient-facing risk assessment program\nintegrated into the EMR, automated risk calculation with clinical decision support for patients and physicians for\nmultiple hereditary cancer syndromes, systematic assessment of risk across a variety of clinic settings,\nguidance and education on family health history, genomics, risk management, and cascade screening, and an\nimplementation sciences framework to allow us to build a novel and scalable clinical care paradigm for\nhereditary cancer risk assessment and risk management. To do this we will: 1) deploy a care delivery model\nthat will facilitate systematic risk assessment for hereditary cancers in diverse clinical environments\n(in primary care and cancer care clinics at two different medical centers) in a randomized controlled trial of\n4000 patients; 2) improve access to genetic healthcare providers for participants at risk for hereditary\ncancer syndromes by deploying the care delivery model in the cancer genetic counseling clinics in a\nrandomized controlled trial of 300 patients; and 3) explore the feasibility of our care delivery model to\nimprove family engagement for cancer risk assessment for patients who are found to have cancer gene\nvariants or strong family histories of cancer.\nWiesner GL and Orlando LA 1	Academic Medical Centers;Appointment;Awareness;Bioinformatics;Cancer Family;Caring;Clinic;Clinical;Clinics and Hospitals;Collection;Communities;Computerized Medical Record;Computers;Counseling;Coupled;Data;Development;Education;Elements;Enrollment;Environment;Family;Family Cancer History;Family health status;Family member;Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources;Genetic;Genetic Counseling;Genetic Medicine;Genetic screening method;Genomics;Geography;Grant;Health;Health Personnel;Health system;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm;Hereditary Neoplastic Syndromes;High Prevalence;Improve Access;Individual;Informatics;Inherited;Interview;Life;Link;Low income;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical;Medical center;Modernization;Oncogenes;Online Systems;Participant;Pathogenicity;Patient Education;Patients;Perception;Physicians;Preventive therapy;Primary Health Care;Provider;Public Health;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recording of previous events;Research Personnel;Resources;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Management;Savings;Service delivery model;Specialist;Structure;Surveys;Syndrome;System;Technology;Telecommunications;Telephone;Testing;Time;Training;Translating;Underserved Population;Universities;Variant;Vertebral column;Wait Time;base;biomedical informatics;cancer care;cancer genetics;cancer risk;clinical care;clinical decision support;evidence base;evidence based guidelines;flexibility;genetic variant;health record;high risk;implementation science;improved;innovation;novel;patient engagement;pressure;programs;screening;support tools;tool;treatment as usual	VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER	NASHVILLE	TN	UNITED STATES	Lori Ann Orlando,GEORGIA L WIESNER	DCCPS	Nonniekaye F Shelburne	5339027	>=$1M	5339027	17-Sep-2019	17-Sep-2019	31-Aug-2024	RFA-CA-19-017	Moonshot
project	1U01CA232836-01A1	U01CA232836	9848961	2019	Randomized trial of universal vs. guideline-directed germline testing among young adults with cancer	Grant	Cancer is the leading nontraumatic cause of death among young adults. In individuals under age 40, cancer\nhas a distinct biology and often has an underlying genetic etiology. However, consensus guidelines driven by\nphenotypic characteristics fail to identify many young adult patients with inherited genetic risk, in part due to\ntheir complexity and to lack of data on mutation frequency. We likely vastly underestimate the frequency and\nspectrum of germline susceptibility in young adults with cancer, knowledge of which would have far-reaching\nimplications both for their treatment and follow-up care and for the diagnosis and management of relatives.\nThus, better strategies for diagnosing inherited risk among young adults with cancer are needed. Further,\ngenetic testing rates among relatives of those identified with inherited cancer risk range from 50-60%;\ninterventions to overcome the barriers that patients and relatives face, so they can take appropriate screening\nand risk-reducing measures, must be developed and tested. Finally, there is a critical need to integrate genetic\nevaluation and test results into the electronic medical record (EMR) to facilitate tailored clinical decision\nsupport for both clinicians and patients. The present proposal seeks to overcome the limitations of current data\nand models of care through two Specific Aims. First, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial among 1421\nyoung adults with cancer, one-third of whom will be members of racial or ethnic minorities or medically\nunderserved groups, to compare rates of ascertainment of genetic risk between guideline-driven, phenotype-\ndirected genetic testing (current standard of care) and universal cancer panel genetic testing. Working with the\nPenn Medicine Nudge Unit and Information Services, we will develop EMR-based algorithms for automatic\npatient referral and clinical decision support, driven by discrete genetic test results ported into the EMR via\nHL7, that will include ‘active choice’ nudges, direct-to-patient alerts, and physician dashboards that minimize\nphysician burden. We will compare adherence to screening recommendations among participants to that\namong historical controls. Second, we will compare the impact of the two up-front testing strategies among\npatients, enhanced by a novel strategy of direct team outreach to at-risk relatives, on ascertainment of genetic\nrisk among family members. We also will conduct qualitative interviews with a diverse sample of patients,\nrelatives, and family groups to describe the critical interactions that facilitate or impede communication about\nrisk and cascade testing within families and to explore the acceptability of direct clinical team outreach to at-\nrisk relatives. The proposed study promises to immediately alter national standards of care and payer policies\nby identifying the preferred approach to evaluating young adult cancer patients for genetic risk through a\nrigorous randomized trial, while measuring ascertainment among both patients and their relatives. In addition,\nbeyond its potential to change standards of care, the study will generate shareable EMR-based code,\nalgorithms, and models that will further enhance the sustainability of the proposed approach.

Symptom side effects such as nausea and diarrhea are\nparticularly common and impactful on the patient experience. However, historically this information has been\nreported by clinicians on behalf of their patients rather than by patients themselves – a process that has been\nshown to miss up to half of patients' symptoms. Therefore, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) supported\ndevelopment of the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse\nEvents (PRO-CTCAE), a library of questions to enable systematic patient self-reporting of side effect\ninformation. To date, the PRO-CTCAE questions have been developed and tested for validity and feasibility of\nuse in clinical trials – work that was led by the investigators on this proposal under contracts to the NCI.\nHowever, it is not yet established how best to combine PRO-CTCAE information with traditional measures of\ntreatment impact such as clinician-reported adverse events, time on treatment, drug dose levels, performance\nstatus, and hospitalizations. The purpose of this proposal is to advance understanding of the role of the PRO-\nCTCAE in combination with these traditional measures of treatment impact in assessments of drug tolerability.\nIn this proposal, advanced statistical methods will be used to analyze data from numerous clinical trials\naccessible to the team through the National Clinical Trial Network (cooperative groups) and industry. The\nspecific aims are to: 1) characterize relationships between the PRO-CTCAE and traditional measures of\ntreatment impact and tolerability; 2) test and standardize analytic techniques for the PRO-CTCAE; 3) refine\napproaches to analyzing missing PRO-CTCAE data; and 4) develop and refine tabular and graphical data\nvisualizations for longitudinal PRO-CTCAE data. To accomplish these aims, an exceptional multidisciplinary\nteam has been assembled including scientific, clinical, and patient investigators with extensive experience in\nacademic and industry clinical research, and longstanding expertise in patient-reported outcomes, adverse\nevents, biostatistics, psychometrics, clinical trial design/analysis, health disparities, and informatics. This team\nhas successfully led multiple prior national research consortia. The team will work collaboratively and flexibly\nwith other investigators and stakeholders through the planned U01 consortium, and will share data, statistical\nprogramming code, and ideas freely. This work is intended to inform best practices for tabulating and reporting\nPRO-CTCAE data, and will enable more systematic and patient-centered evaluations of tolerability in cancer\nclinical trials.

project	1U01CA233056-01	U01CA233056	9626226	2018	Neoantigen Vaccination for Lynch Syndrome Immunoprevention	Grant	Lynch syndrome (LS) is a genetic disease predisposing to colorectal cancer (CRC) that affects more than one\nmillion Americans. Germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, primarily MLH1 and MSH2,\ncause deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) and LS. LS CRCs have exceptionally high numbers of small\ninsertion/deletion frameshift and missense mutations. Elevated dMMR mutation rates cause some mutations to\nrecurrently arise in tumors from different patients. For example, the human TGFβR2 gene has a poly(A) coding\nrepeat, and the same “shared” frameshift mutation is recurrently identified in >60% of LS dMMR CRCs. Here,\nwe will use state of the art tools to systematically delineate recurrent LS mouse and human pre-malignant\nneoantigens, test whether vaccination with frequently mutated “shared” immunogenic neoantigens reduces LS\nmouse CRC penetrance, and elucidate adaptive immune mechanisms for CRC immunoprevention. In Aim 1\nwe will comprehensively delineate frequently mutated recurrent neoantigens in Lynch syndrome mouse\ncolorectal mucosa and adenomas. This will provide insights into pre-malignant colon dMMR immunoediting\nmechanisms, the timing and sequence of dMMR neoantigen appearance, and systematically delineate the\nmost immunogenic recurrent shared dMMR neoantigen vaccine targets for LS mouse CRC immunoprevention.\nIn Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome\nmismatch repair deficient epithelial cells in colon mucosa. This will give insights into the mechanism of dMMR\ncolon mucosal immunoediting, and test the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent neoantigen vaccine\nstrategy using the earliest neoantigen mutations for LS immunoprevention. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis\nthat recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome colorectal tumor burden. This will\nevaluate the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent adenoma neoantigen vaccine strategy for Lynch\nsyndrome immunoprevention and provide insights into the mechanisms of dMMR immunoediting. Finally, in\nAim 4 we will systematically delineate Lynch syndrome patient adenoma recurrent neoantigens. This will\ndelineate the most promising candidate recurrent neoantigens that can be used for LS patient tumor vaccine\nclinical trials and give insights into dMMR immunoediting mechanisms. Our overall goal is to develop effective,\nsafe mechanism based neoantigen vaccination strategies for Lynch syndrome CRC immunoprevention.

project	1U01CA233074-01	U01CA233074	9626083	2018	Targeting alternative splicing for TCR discovery in small cell carcinomas	Grant	ABSTRACT\n We present a collaborative immunotherapeutics discovery program that exploits alternative pre-mRNA\nsplicing as a source of cancer-specific epitopes for T-cell receptor (TCR) therapy of small cell carcinomas of\nthe prostate and lung. Small cell carcinomas arise from many different epithelial tissues but are generally\naggressive, have no curative treatment, and carry a dire prognosis. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most\ncommon subtype. Small cell prostate cancer (SCPC) is rare as a primary disease but is becoming increasingly\ncommon as a late-stage phenotypic transition in response to hormone-deprivation therapy. Emerging research\nindicates that despite their disparate tissues of origin, SCPC and SCLC are highly similar in behavior and\nmolecular phenotype. This suggests effective targeted therapies could address both malignancies.\n Our strategy is to define cancer-specific epitopes created by alternative pre-mRNA splicing in small cell\ncarcinomas and then use these targets to develop TCR-based therapeutics. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell\n(CAR-T) therapies targeting cell surface proteins have been developed for some hematological malignancies,\nbut this strategy has been unsuccessful for epithelial tumors. The limited cancer specificity of the target epitope\nhas led to significant on-target, off-tumor toxicities in human trials. We have chosen to pursue TCRs to expand\nthe pool of available targets beyond the cell surface. We hypothesize that tapping into the additional proteomic\ndiversity revealed by a detailed analysis of alternatively spliced exons will provide better targets.\n Our team of principal investigators includes experts in the computational biology of alternative splicing\n(Yi Xing), cancer cell biology and immunology (Owen Witte), and hematopoietic cell development and\nimmunology (Gay Crooks). We are compiling RNA-Seq data on small cell cancers and normal tissues from\npublic datasets and new human cell line models of SCPC & SCLC derived from benign cells by lentiviral\ntransduction. This combined dataset serves as the foundation for our discovery effort. We plan to pair this with\ntotal proteomics analysis to identify spliced isoforms that affect protein composition. This data will be further\nintegrated with immunopeptidomics assays that define the pool of peptides presented to the immune system\nby the target cancer cells.

All three\napproaches induce T cell mediated killing of cancer cells. However, widespread development of bi-specific\nantibodies and CAR T cells is limited by the small number of known cell-surface proteins that are sufficiently\nspecific to cancer to safely allow targeting by antibodies. This is particularly true for solid cancers, where unlike\nhematopoietic malignancies, loss of healthy cells cannot be readily replenished by stem cell progenitors. A\nsolution to this issue is to target cancer specific glycan antigens rather than protein antigens. Indeed, altered\nglycosylation is a near universal feature of cancer and represent the most abundant and widely expressed cell\nsurface cancer antigens, while also having limited or no expression in normal tissue. However, generation of\nmonoclonal antibodies specific to complex carbohydrates has proven to be very challenging, greatly limiting\ntheir usefulness as targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we propose to address these issues and\ndevelop a novel class of immunotherapeutics that target an N-linked carbohydrate antigen common to\nthe vast majority of solid and hematopoietic cancers. We have termed these molecules as Glycan-\ndependent T cell Recruiter (GlyTR) technology. Critically, GlyTR technology does not utilize antibodies to\ntarget carbohydrate cancer antigens. Preliminary data demonstrates that the GlyTR bi-specific protein 1)\nspecifically bound to both human CD3 and its N-glycan target, 2) robustly activated T cells only in the presence\nof cancer cells, 3) induced T cell dependent killing of cancer cells with an EC50 as low as 5pM, 4) inhibited in\nvivo growth of established colon cancer xenografts in humanized NSG mice and 5) did not trigger production of\nantibodies in mice. To further expand on this approach, the following Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will\ncharacterize human and mouse reactive GlyTR bi-specific proteins targeting N-glycans. Aim 2 will\nexamine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using humanized NSG mice.\nAim 3 will examine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using mice with a\nnormal immune system. If successful, these experiments will provide proof of principal data for an entire new\nclass of cancer killing immunotherapeutic's capable of targeting multiple solid and hematopoietic cancers with\nminimal toxicity.

However, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been limited by low response rates and limited durations\nof response in certain settings, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer\n(TNBC), as well as ovarian, prostate and colorectal cancers. These findings are explained, at least in part, by\nthe premise that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is only one of a number of tumor immune suppressive mechanisms that\nrequire inhibition.\n Therefore, additional strategies are clearly needed to improve the immunotherapy of human cancers. In\nthis respect, cancer cells activate a program of immune evasion involving, for example, induction of PD-L1\nexpression and the downregulation of effectors that promote innate and adaptive immune response. The\ndiscovery and targeting of such immune suppressive programs has had limited success to date, supporting a\ncritical need for identifying signaling pathways that activate these programs.\n The MUC1-C oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in human carcinomas and is associated with poor\nclinical outcomes. MUC1-C promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the cancer stem cell\n(CSC) state. Recent advances have demonstrated that MUC1-C also activates a program of immune evasion\nin human cancer cells that includes upregulation of PD-L1 expression and the suppression of immune\neffectors, such as IFN. In addition, targeting MUC1-C has been found to effectively reverse tumor immune\nevasion.\n These findings have emphasized the need for developing agents that target MUC1-C for the\nimmunotherapy of human cancers. In this way, selective and potent antibodies generated against the MUC1-C\nextracellular domain are under development as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and for antibody-\ndependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, a peptide inhibitor of the MUC1-C cytoplasmic\ndomain has been developed in a nanoparticle formulation, based on the findings that this agent inhibits PD-L1\nexpression and activates anti-tumor T cells in the immune microenvironment.\n The MUC1-C-targeted agents will be studied in genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for\nanti-tumor activity, as well as effects on the immune microenvironment when used alone and in combination\nwith PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade. These studies will be integrated with assessment of MUC1-C expression in\nhuman tumors as a metric of the suppressive immune microenvironment. The overall goal will be to develop\nagents that target MUC1-C and are advanced to clinical evaluation as novel immunotherapeutics.

project	1U01CA233085-01A1	U01CA233085	9869478	2019	Reprograming the tumor microenvironment to overcome multiple primary and acquired immune resistance mechanisms in ovarian cancer	Grant	The goal of our studies is to generate robust and long-lasting tumor-specific T cell responses for durable\ntumor regression in patients with chemotherapy-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Although\nimmunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive T cell therapy, or oncolytic viruses has generated\nremarkable results in several other tumor types, long-term tumor control has been infrequent in EOC patients.\nStudies by our group have identified key stumbling blocks underpinning the limited efficacy of immunotherapy\nin EOC, which include: (i) insufficient expansion of tumor-specific T cells, (ii) tumor-derived CXCL12 production\nthat recruits Tregs and MDSC within tumors, (iii) expression of PD1 and LAG3 marking severely dysfunctional\ntumor infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), (iv) compensatory upregulation of LAG3 upon blockade of PD1 and\nvice-versa, and (v) disorganized and tortuous tumor vasculature lacking adequate flow dynamics to support\ntrafficking of anti-tumor T cells. While combinatorial immunotherapy strategies have the potential to overcome\nthese immune resistance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME), they are often associated with\nunacceptably high rates of toxicities in patients. Our proposal addresses these stumbling blocks using\ninnovative, clinically-translatable strategies to reprogram the TME and to identify mechanisms that drive or\nhinder T cell trafficking into ovarian tumors.\n We previously demonstrated blockade of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in the ovarian TME by intraperitoneal\ndelivery of an oncolytic vaccinia virus expressing a CXCR4 antagonist (OV-CXCR4-Fc) reduced intratumoral\naccumulation of immunosuppressive mediators and stimulated spontaneous antitumor immunity to\nendogenous tumor antigens. OV-CXCR4-Fc also improved T cell trafficking. We will build on the multifaceted\nantitumor activity of OV-CXCR4-Fc by further “arming” with antagonists of PD1 and LAG3, the two co-inhibitory\nreceptors we have shown mark severely dysfunctional TILs in EOC patients. In addition, we plan to uncover\nthe molecular mechanisms by which OV-CXCR4-Fc enhances T cell migration and trafficking to overcome the\novarian tumor “vascular checkpoint”. We hypothesize that in vivo tumor destruction by OV engineered to\nexpress the CXCR4 antagonist and PD1/LAG3 inhibitors (OV-CXCR4-Fc-PD1/LAG3) will limit dampening of\nthe immune response in the TME and induce a molecular signature that promotes trafficking and homing of\ntumor-specific T cells. To test our hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims:\n Aim 1. Determine the therapeutic synergy of arming OV-CXCR4-Fc with PD1/LAG3 inhibitors.\n Aim 2. Determine the mechanism by which OV-CXCR4-Fc promotes T cell trafficking in murine and human\n ovarian tumors.\n Aim 3. To manufacture and certify a Master Viral Bank (MVB) and Final Product (FP) of OV-CXCR4-Fc for\n IND qualification.

project	1U01CA233096-01A1	U01CA233096	9868724	2019	Cytokine immunotherapies for melanoma	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nImmunotherapies for cancer, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), have exhibited impressive efficacy for\na broad spectrum of cancers, including melanoma. However, despite their potential to produce dramatic\ntreatment responses, ICI have proven to be ineffective for most patients and tumor types. Consequently, there\nremains a need for new immunotherapies that are effective in patients who are resistant or non-responsive to\ncurrent ICI. To this end, immune cytokines have potent immunostimulatory activities that make them attractive\npotential therapeutics. Compared to the effect of ICI to “tune” existing immune responses, cytokines can tap into\npowerful programs that can effectively “reprogram” immune cells and control their activation, differentiation, and\nproliferation. Among cytokines, Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is an appealing immunotherapeutic candidate given its\nability to stimulate both adaptive and innate immunity through CD8+ T and NK cells, respectively. However, the\nactivity of IL-18 is limited by an endogenous decoy receptor, IL-18BP, which is induced as part of a negative\nfeedback loop by interferon gamma activity, reminiscient of the regulation of the PD-1:PD-L1 axis and suggesting\nthat it may represent a “soluble immune checkpoint” in cancer. Using directed evolution, the Ring lab has created\nan engineered version of IL-18 that is fully capable of activating the IL-18 receptor, but impervious to inhibition\nby IL-18BP. This decoy resistant IL-18 (DR-18) is active as a mono-immunotherapy in preclinical mouse models,\nwhere it can induce complete and durable tumor regressions. DR-18 also synergizes with ICI (anti-PD-1) therapy\nand is associated with high cure rates and limited toxicity in this setting. Notably, DR-18 is also effective for the\ntreatment of MHC class I deficient murine tumors, which are resistant to ICI treatment, consistent with the ability\nof IL-18 to also activate anti-tumor activity of NK cells. In order to better understand the mechanism of DR-18\nimmunotherapy and enable its translation into the clinic, we propose to leverage a comprehensive series of\nsophisticated, genetically-defined syngeneic mouse models of melanoma called YUMM and YUMMER that we\nhave developed. We propose to more comprehensively evaluate our hypothesis that bypass of the IL-18BP\ncheckpoint by DR-18 will enable responses in ICI-resistant tumors in two Aims: 1) Evaluation and optimization\nof DR-18 therapy in melanoma, and 2) Development of DR-18 for the treatment of ICI-resistant tumors. We will\nutilize techniques including single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitiative pathology to better characterize DR-18\nresponses in the tumor microenvironment over time. Results from murine experiments will be functionally\nvalidated in fresh, dissociated human melanoma specimens. We aim to begin clinical trials with human DR-18\nin 2020; these aims are focused on understanding and optimizing DR-18 in anticipation of this work.

However, the therapeutic potential of the immune system in eliminating premalignant cells\nand preventing their progression to invasive cancers is unclear. To determine the benefit of activating the\nimmune system to prevent cancer development and recurrence, we study the immune pathways that lead to\neffective immune activation against early phases of breast cancer development. Breast cancer is the most\ncommon internal cancer and second cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Importantly,\nthe individuals at high risk of developing breast cancer due to underlying genetic mutations and those with\npremalignant lesions can be clinically identified and treated. Therefore, discovering an effective approach to\nactivate the patients' own immune system against early breast precursor lesions may yield a lasting memory\nthat can prevent breast cancer development and recurrence in this high-risk population. Our previous studies\nhave demonstrated that a skin-derived immune factor called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) suppresses\nthe early stages of skin and breast cancer development. We have been able to extend these finding to clinics\nthrough a randomized double-blind clinical trial in which we find TSLP induction to promote a robust immune\nactivation against skin cancer precursors and their complete clearance. In order to determine the precise\nmechanism of TSLP-induced immune response against early premalignant cells in the breast, and to extend\nour findings to other similar immune factors in high-risk patients, we aim to (1) determine the immune cells and\nsignals that target breast premalignant cells in response to TSLP, (2) investigate the role of other immune\nfactors released by breast cells that can induce immune response to block breast cancer development, and (3)\ndetermine the factors that are driving the immune response in the breast glands of patients with genetic\nmutations and utilize them for induction of an optimal immune response against early breast cancer. The\noutcomes of the proposed research will establish a foundation for the use of the immune system in blocking\nbreast cancer development and provide novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer immunoprevention.

project	1U01CA233100-01	U01CA233100	9625897	2018	Molecular and immune drivers of immunotherapy responsiveness in prostate cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nDespite recent advances in treatment, metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains\nincurable, and approximately 30,000 men die of this disease yearly. Advances in immunotherapy with drugs\ntargeting immune checkpoints have raised hopes that these agents will improve outcomes for mCRPC\npatients. While initial studies of immune checkpoint blockade have been unsuccessful, emerging evidence\nsuggests a subset of prostate cancer (PCa) patients can respond, although the mechanisms of PCa\nimmunotherapy response and resistance are incompletely characterized. Work in other immunotherapy\nresponsive malignancies has found several predictive immune and tumor-intrinsic properties that contribute to\nresponse, but the extent to which these (or other) features are operant in PCa is largely unknown. For\nexample, we recently identified mutations in a chromatin remodeling complex that mediates immunotherapy\nresponse through T cell interactions in solid tumors, and in parallel discovered a previously unknown PCa\ngenomic subclass defined by mutations in these same chromatin remodelers. These findings indicate that\ntumor-intrinsic epigenetic dysregulation may also interact with the immune system to modulate PCa\nimmunotherapy responsiveness. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that multiple immune and tumor-\nintrinsic properties mediate PCa interactions with the immune system, and these interactions can be modified\nthrough selective targeting in combination with checkpoint blockade to expand the therapeutic potential of\nimmunotherapy in PCa. We will leverage our team's deep experience in clinically grounded molecular\ncharacterization and preclinical models that can test immunotherapy combinations in PCa to define the\nprocesses that govern the immunotherapy landscape in PCa. The proposed specific aims are: 1) Define the\nsystemic and infiltrating immune states in PCa associated with clinical response to checkpoint blockade; 2)\nEstablish the immunologic impact of chromatin dysregulation and inhibition in PCa; and 3) Determine the\nimpact of existing DNA damaging agents for sensitizing PCa to PD-1 blockade. This proposal leverages the\nextensive, novel, and complementary resources at both Dana-Farber/Broad Institute and University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, led by highly collaborative investigators and an international scientific team, to\naddress the hypotheses outlined herein. Through a combination of functional, molecular, and clinical\napproaches inherent in these studies, our team is poised to identify mCRPC cohorts that may benefit from this\ntreatment paradigm, determine strategies to augment the use of checkpoint inhibitors in this disease, and\nmechanistically define the immune and tumor-intrinsic defects that drive immunoresistance in PCa. Broadly,\nthis project will provide a unique approach for the Immuno-Oncology Translation Network (IOTN) community\nand enable discovery of anti-cancer immunotherapies strategies for PCa that may have larger relevance\nacross the IOTN network and collaborating members of the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.

Using an “in situ vaccine”\nregimen consisting of 12 Gy focal external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and intratumoral (IT) injection of\ntumor-specific antibody (mAb) + IL2, we have eradicated solitary, large, cold syngeneic tumors in mice. This in\nsitu vaccine converts the targeted tumor into a focus of enhanced tumor antigen presentation resulting in\nincreased T-cell infiltration and potent T-cell memory. However, the presence of an identical but untreated\nsecond tumor (2°) on a mouse’s opposite flank inhibits the effect of this treatment, preventing eradication of the\nprimary (1°) tumor treated with EBRT + IT mAb-IL2. In this setting, the untreated 2° tumor causes tumor-\nspecific immune unresponsiveness to EBRT + IT mAb-IL2 at the 1° tumor. We refer to this as concomitant\nimmune tolerance (CIT). We can overcome CIT, and eliminate both tumors by giving IT mAb-IL2 to the 1°\ntumor and EBRT to both the 1° and 2° tumors. Delivering as little as 2 Gy EBRT to the 2° tumor can overcome\nCIT. Clinically, delivery of EBRT (even low dose) to all sites of metastatic disease is problematic, but this can\neffectively be achieved using molecular targeted radiation therapy (MTRT). MTRT is increasingly entering\nclinical oncology practice and our UW team has led preclinical and clinical testing of a novel class of MTRT\nusing alkylphosphocholine (APCh) analogs that selectively deliver radiation to cancers in vivo. These show\ntumor-selective uptake in virtually all mammalian tumor cells and tumor locations tested (including > 90 tumor\nlines and in patients across various clinical trials). In a syngeneic murine melanoma model, we have observed\na potent synergy between systemically administered ICI and MTRT delivered using our next-generation APC\nanalog, 90Y-NM600. In a project that builds upon the ongoing collaborative progress of our multidisciplinary\nteam, we will now systematically optimize the potency of combining MTRT with immunotherapy to enhance\nthe immune response against immunologically cold tumors. In murine models, we will: 1) expand on\npreliminary data showing potent synergy with the combination of MTRT and ICI, 2) evaluate the capacity of\nMTRT to overcome CIT and enhance systemic anti-tumor immune response in the setting of multiple tumors\nwhere one is treated with in situ vaccine (EBRT + IT mAb-IL2) alone or in combination with ICI. Because\nmurine models do not replicate the size and spatial distribution of human metastatic cancer and because these\nfactors strongly influence the dosimetry of MTRT, we will test the immunomodulatory effects of MTRT + in situ\nvaccine in large breed companion canines (pet dogs) with naturally occurring metastatic melanoma. The\ninsights and treatment regimens developed in these studies should enable rapid translation to clinical\ntesting in patients and potentially for any type of metastatic cancer.	90Y;Address;Anatomy;Animals;Antibodies;Antigen Presentation;Biology;Cancer Model;Canis familiaris;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Companions;Data;Disease;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Distant;Dose;Epitope spreading;External Beam Radiation Therapy;Generations;Goals;Half-Life;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Human;IL2 gene;Image;Immune;Immune Evasion;Immune Tolerance;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immunocompetent;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Infiltration;Injections;Intravenous;Isotopes;Length;Location;Low Dose Radiation;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metastatic Melanoma;Modality;Modeling;Molecular Target;Monoclonal Antibodies;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Mus;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Preclinical Testing;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radioisotopes;Regimen;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Safety;Site;Soft tissue sarcoma;Spatial Distribution;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Targeted Radiotherapy;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Translations;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Immunity;Ursidae Family;Vaccination;Vaccines;Veins;Vision;Work;analog;anti-tumor immune response;cancer site;checkpoint inhibition;dosimetry;efficacy testing;immunogenic;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;insight;mRNA Expression;melanoma;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoantigens;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;novel strategies;pre-clinical;prevent;protein expression;radiation effect;research clinical testing;response;sarcoma;synergism;systemic toxicity;treatment effect;tumor;tumor eradication;tumor microenvironment;uptake;virtual	UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON	MADISON	WI	UNITED STATES	Zachary Scott Morris,JAMEY P WEICHERT	DCTD	Mansoor M Ahmed	765000	$750k to $999k	765000	18-Sep-2018	18-Sep-2018	31-Aug-2023	RFA-CA-17-045	Moonshot
project	1U01CA233167-01	U01CA233167	9626529	2018	Understanding Treatment Tolerability in Older Patients with Cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe overarching goal of this five-year grant proposal, submitted on behalf of the University of Rochester NCI\nCommunity Oncology Research Program (UR NCORP) Research Base and the Cancer and Aging Research\nGroup (CARG), in response to RFA-CA-17-052, is: to evaluate whether items from the Patient-Reported\nOutcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) are\nassociated with tolerability of treatment for advanced cancer in older patients with age-related\nconditions (i.e., disability, comorbidity, and geriatric syndromes). The growing population of older patients\nremains underrepresented in research that sets cancer care standards leading to significant disparities in\noutcomes. In our preliminary research, we found that: 1) close to 60% of older patients develop grade 3-5\ntoxicity (as measured by NCI's CTCAE) within three months of starting a new treatment regimen; items from\ngeriatric assessment (GA) were significantly associated with toxicity; 2) older patients with advanced cancer\nfrequently experience multiple symptoms that interfere with function and quality of life (QoL); and 3) older\npatients often experience toxicities that lead to early discontinuation of treatment, hospitalizations, and\nmortality. We have an unprecedented opportunity to leverage an existing multi-site cluster randomized study\nthat is currently enrolling adults aged >70 years with age-related conditions who are starting a new treatment\nregimen for advanced cancer in the UR NCORP network (URCC 13059/“GAP”) (n=700). In addition to\nclinician-rated CTCAE, GAP captures PRO measures (PRO-CTCAE, GA, satisfaction) at baseline, 4 weeks, 3\nmonths, and 6 months after the start of the new treatment regimen. Extensive data are collected on clinical\ntolerability metrics including treatment dose modifications, hospitalizations, and mortality. We will collaborate\nwith the U01 consortium to: 1) develop and compare the trajectories of PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated\nCTCAE grades 2-5 in older patients with age-related conditions; 2) evaluate associations between PRO-\nCTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with clinical tolerability metrics; 3) evaluate associations\nbetween PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with PRO endpoints (e.g., function, QoL,\nsatisfaction); and 4) validate a model that identifies older patients with age-related conditions who are at high\nrisk for poor tolerability from treatment for advanced cancer. Developed with stakeholders, our operational\ndefinition of tolerability is novel; it includes both clinical outcomes and PRO endpoints. The team, which\nincludes expertise in clinical trials (Mohile, Morrow, Janelsins, Kamen), biostatistics and data science\n(Culakova, Heckler, Pandya, Ramsdale, Zand), PRO measurement (Mohile, Duberstein, Chapman, Flannery),\nand collaborations with CARG (Hurria, Dale) and patient advocates (SCOREBoard led by Canin) is uniquely\nsuited to conduct this research. This research will address a critical gap in knowledge of how patient-reported\ntoxicity informs tolerability of treatment in older patients with advanced cancer and age-related conditions.

These methods will\nharness the potential of the patient-reported outcomes version of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for\nAdverse Events (PRO-CTCAETM) to provide previously unavailable patient perspectives on the tolerability of\ntreatments (including targeted agents, immunotherapies, and other evolving treatments for which the type,\nseverity, timing, and trajectory of adverse events is less known). Such information will help providers better\nidentify and support patients at risk for treatment discontinuation, dose reductions, and treatment delays.\nSpecifically, this study aims to: 1) perform longitudinal analyses of CTCAE and PRO-CTCAE data from trials\nconducted within the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, using traditional and innovative strategies to\nexamine AE trajectories and to produce a new reporting standard that reflects severity and fluctuations over\ntime; 2) examine PRO-CTCAE and CTCAE predictors of treatment adherence and discontinuation; and 3)\nvalidate the broader predictive value of GP5, a single item from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-\nGeneral (FACT-G) shown to predict early treatment discontinuation among women with breast cancer taking\naromatase inhibitors. The study will also explore two novel measurement models for PRO-CTCAE scores and\nCTCAE grades: a phenotypic model including co-occurrence of symptoms and a cumulative burden index\n(CBI) for characterizing the quantity of burden accumulated by patients over time. Analyses will include\ndemographic factors and insurance status to identify potential disparities.

project	1U01CA239258-01	U01CA239258	9626217	2018	Enhancing cell therapy for brain tumors	Grant	ABSTRACT\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain cancer, with standard treatments based on\nsurgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy promoting an overall survival of approximately 15 months. This has\nled to a resurgence of interest in immune-based approaches. While augmenting immunity has been successful\nin other malignancies like melanoma and leukemia/lymphoma, their efficacy in treatment of brain tumors has\nbeen very limited. Tumor antigen heterogeneity, limited number of infiltrating lymphocytes at the tumor site,\nand failure of checkpoint inhibitor drugs to cross the blood brain barrier all represent major obstacles to\neffective immune-therapies in GBM. Altered immunity in patients with GBM further contributes to the poor\nprognoses of these tumors and their relative resistance to vaccine and checkpoint inhibitors. Utilizing healthy\ndonor immune cells in the form of adoptive cell therapy may offer a more effective alternative. However, limited\ninformation is available on the properties of effector populations that would exert effective anti-tumor activity in\nthe brain. Pioneering work by Dr. Rick Jones at Johns Hopkins University utilizing haploidentical donor\ntransplant (haplo-BMT) for brain tumors offers an opportunity to test kinetics of infused healthy donor immune\ncells in this patient population, providing a glimpse of what donor immune cells can do against brain tumors.\nPrevious experiences with haplo-BMT suggest that effector cells of the innate immunity – natural killer cells\n(NKs) and invariant natural killer T cells (iNKTs) – mediate anti-tumor activity with decreased frequency of\nrelapse. Innate immune cells are also potentially advantageous in the brain tumor setting, which affords very\nlittle tolerance for the adverse events associated with (for example) CD19-CAR T cell based-therapies. Finally,\nboth iNKT and NK cells can actively migrate to the site of GBM following the CCL2 gradient, the chemokine\nreleased by tumor cells and the surrounding tumor associated macrophages (TAM). Dr. Savoldo at\nUniversity of North Carolina has unique expertise in the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)\ntransduced T cells and iNKT cells and Dr. Bollard at Children's National has extensive experience with the\ngenetically modified T cells and NK cells. Hence, in this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that\nnontolerized innate immune cells (NKs and iNKTs) derived from healthy donors will promote anti-\ntumor immunity in patients GBM, and may be developed as effective cellular therapies. This overarching\nhypothesis will be tested in 3 Specific Aims where Dr. Jones (Aim 1) will compare the cellular signatures of\niNKTs and NK cells isolated from healthy donors versus patients with GBM. In Aim 2, Dr. Savoldo and the\nUNC team will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of healthy donor iNKT and NK cells modified to express an anti-\nB7H3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and in Aim 3, Drs. Bollard and Cruz at CNMC overcome the inhibitory\ntumor microenvironment in GBM by targeting immune suppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and\nTGFβ.

Traditional germline genetic testing models, which\ninclude in-depth genetic counseling both before and after testing, are time intensive and place substantial\ndemands on the limited genetic counselor workforce. A “mainstreaming” model, which allows for non-genetics\nhealthcare providers to order genetic testing without pre-test genetic counseling, with support from genetic\ncounselors at the time of result disclosure, has shown promise. Yet, past evaluations of mainstreaming models\nhave been hampered by serious limitations: Studies were restricted to the context of BRCA1/2 testing and do\nnot reflect the growing use of multigene panel testing (MGPT); rarely used rigorous experimental study designs\nor evaluated theoretically-relevant decision-making, psychosocial, and communication outcomes; have not\ncapitalized on opportunities to improve post-test clinical and familial communication; and neither included nor\naddressed informational needs of minority and medically underserved patients. We overcome these limitations\nwith the proposed study, the objective of which is to develop, test, and evaluate a linguistically and culturally\nappropriate mainstreaming (LCAM) model for hereditary cancer MGPT among cancer patients diverse in\nrace/ethnicity, language, and education. We will first use formative research methods, including transcreation\nand cognitive interviewing, to adapt existing pre-test educational materials and post-test clinical communication\nmaterials for use among the diverse population treated at our community hospital partnering sites (Kings\nCounty Hospital Center, Queens Cancer Center). Next, we will conduct an RCT involving English, Haitian\nCreole, or Spanish-speaking patients diagnosed with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer (N=500).\nPatients will be randomized to obtain access to cancer MGPT through either: i) standard-of-care wherein in-\ndepth pre-test and post-test genetic counseling are provided via telegenetics (i.e., videoconferencing delivered\nat the site clinic) with standard post-test clinical communication materials, or ii) LCAM intervention wherein\npatients receive the adapted pre-test educational materials with testing ordered by their oncologist, followed by\npost-test genetic counseling provided via telephone with adapted clinical communication materials. Patients\nwill complete assessments of decision-making, psychosocial, and behavioral outcomes at baseline, upon\ndeciding whether to have MGPT, and at 1-week and 6-months following receipt of their test results. Long-term\nengagement among patients who receive a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) result will also be explored\none year after result receipt through uptake of an offer to discuss any changes in cancer risk or variant\nreclassification and an additional assessment. This research has the potential to transform genetic counseling\nand testing practice by promoting effective risk communication, decision making, and more equitable delivery\nof genomic medicine to those at risk of hereditary cancer syndromes.

Genetic counseling is therefore recommended for all AYAs with new cancer diagnoses, for whom\nresults can lead to future cancer screening, risk-reducing surgeries, and reproductive counseling. Testing can\nalso have a domino effect, identifying other affected relatives and reducing cancer risk in entire families.\nAYAs require unique considerations when communicating cancer risk due to wide variability in developmental\nand emotional maturity. Genetic counseling necessitates complex cognitive and affective processing from\nAYAs, ideally resulting in an active ownership of their condition and a commitment to life-long health behavior\nchange. This tall order comes as AYAs are forming their identity, gaining parental independence, and\nconsidering future childbearing – often under the shadow of enormous personal or family losses from cancer.\nThese factors complicate AYAs' ability to weigh tradeoffs of genetic testing and screening recommendations –\nsometimes with tragic consequences. Unfortunately, there have been few if any efforts to optimize cancer risk\ncommunication and decision-making for AYAs. The goal of this project is to develop, implement and test\nan AYA-specific intervention for cancer risk communication and decision-making.\nOur interdisciplinary team of experts in health communication, cancer genetics, oncology, and pediatric\npsychology from 4 major Cancer Risk Programs will develop AYA-RISE (Risk Information and Screening\nEducation), a web-based intervention comprised of (1) an interactive chatbot designed to communicate\ngenetic information to AYAs in developmentally appropriate ways; and (2) an individualized patient portal,\nserving as an educational resource and longitudinal repository for cancer risk and screening information.\nIterative user testing with qualitative feedback from AYAs will be used to optimize the program prior to\nconducting a type I hybrid implementation effectiveness trial of AYA-RISE. Our aims are:\nAim 1: To refine and pilot AYA-RISE, adapting implementation to ensure feasibility and acceptability\namong AYAs with cancer risk syndromes, their family members, and providers.\nAim 2: To test AYA-RISE among AYAs with cancer predisposition syndromes at 4 centers to determine\nimpact on (1) patient knowledge of cancer risk and recommended screening; (2) psychological\ndistress; (3) patient ownership of information; and (4) follow-up for recommended care.\nAim 3: To evaluate implementation outcomes of AYA-RISE, including ways that AYAs use the chatbot\nand patient portal, and AYA, family, and provider experiences, to facilitate future dissemination.\nIf successful, this study will yield a scalable, patient- and family-centered intervention to improve cancer risk\ncommunication and decision-making for AYAs and their families, with an ultimate goal of cancer risk reduction.

Hereditary cancer\nsyndromes are more common than previously appreciated, and genetic testing is standard of care to\nestablish these diagnoses. Genetic test results are also critical to guiding targeted therapies in patients\nwith established tumors such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Genetic counselors have traditionally\nmanaged the testing process, but there is a critical shortage of counselors and they are not able to meet\nthe demand for testing. Without a genetic counselor, effective communication of testing options, outcomes,\nand risks could be compromised. One of the most challenging decisions is the choice of gene panel. Multi-\ngene panels are now the norm, but panels can include as few as 5 or as many as 125 genes. Panels can\ninclude genes associated with a single tumor type or multiple tumor types, and genes with weaker evidence\nfor pathogenicity may also be included. There is no consensus on what constitutes an ideal panel, and\nthe choice of panel is therefore highly individualized. Innovative strategies to support patients facing these\ntime-sensitive and complex pre-test decisions are needed.\nDecision aids are well-suited to address this challenge by providing education, facilitating the process of\ninformed choice, clarifying personal preferences, and promoting shared decision making. We propose to\ndevelop an electronic decision aid to assist individuals in choosing a multi-gene panel with their medical\noncologist instead of a genetic counselor. We will test the hypothesis that a decision aid without a genetic\ncounselor can facilitate quality decisions around the selection of a specific multi-gene panel. In addition\nto positive changes in knowledge, shared decision making, and decisional conflict, we anticipate that the\ndecision aid will increase access to genetic testing in a timely manner. Utilizing an effectiveness-\nimplementation hybrid study design, we propose these specific aims: (1) To develop and pilot electronic\ndecision aids for selection of a multi-gene panel in ovarian and pancreatic cancer patients. (2) To evaluate\nthe efficacy of the decision aid with an oncologist versus a traditional genetic counselor session for multi-\ngene panel testing in a randomized clinical trial at multiple institutions. (3) To evaluate the effectiveness of\nimplementation of the decision aid in multiple, diverse populations.\nThese decision aids will establish a much needed and new paradigm for quality decision making and\ncommunication around multi-gene panel testing for inherited cancer syndromes. This format will uniquely\naddress the current barriers that include the complex decision of which multi-gene panel to select, limited\ngenetic counselor resources, and lack of time and expertise on the part of practicing oncologists.

Yet, access to genetic specialists is limited in many areas\nin the US, and <20% of eligible patients with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer complete\ngenetic testing. Thus, there is an urgent need to consider alternative delivery models to increase access and\nuptake of genetic testing, while maintaining adequate patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes. Our\nresearch has shown that providing remote services increases uptake of genetic testing in community practices\nincreases uptake of genetic testing. Preliminary data from our ongoing NIH-funded RESPECT study has\nrevealed high interest in a web-based eHealth alternative to traditional pre-test counseling and no significant no\ndifferences in pre- and post-disclosure outcomes when the web-based eHealth intervention is utilized as\ncompared to participants who received traditional pre-test genetic counselor. To address the clinically significant\nneed for alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of cancer genetic testing, while maintaining\nadequate patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes, we propose to recruit a nationally diverse “real-\nworld” sample of 1000 patients who have access barriers to genetic testing and to conduct a Hybrid Type 1\neffectiveness-implementation study to evaluate web-based eHealth delivery alternatives for genetic education\nand testing. We hypothesize that our theoretically and stakeholder informed eHealth delivery alternatives can\nprovide equal or better uptake of testing and outcomes of genetic testing as compared to the traditional model\nof pre- and post-test counseling with a genetic counselor. We will partner with several cancer advocacy groups\n(ASCO, breastcancer.org, Cancer Support Community, Pennsylvania Prostate Cancer Coalition) to recruit\npatients to this randomized non-inferiority study using a modified 2x2 design (Aims 1-2). In Arm 1, traditional\npre-test (visit 1) and post-test (visit 2: disclosure) counseling will be provided remotely through the national Penn\nTelegenetics Program and compared to delivery arms where patients can complete pre-test and/or disclosure of\nresults through a self-directed web-based eHealth intervention, either in place of, or as an adjunct to traditional\ngenetic counseling. Concurrently, we will conduct a CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation\nResearch)-informed process evaluation to understand moderators of intervention usage and patient outcomes\nand facilitators and barriers to future implementation and sustainability of this novel eHealth alternative delivery\nmodel for genetic services both within and beyond cancer care (Aim 3). We hypothesize that a rigorously\ndeveloped theoretically and stake-holder informed eHealth delivery alternative provided through a centralized\nTelegenetics Program has the potential to provide equal or improved patient outcomes, while reducing genetic\nprovider time and providing access to services in community practices where access to genetic services has\nbeen limited, providing opportunities to realize the promise of precision medicine in oncology.

Clinical studies show that autologous stem cell\ntransplantation (ASCT) remains an efficacious consolidation treatment for eligible patients and a subset of\ntransplant recipients achieve long-term control of disease. Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced\nby ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates\ninflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the\npotential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. We have recently utilized novel preclinical models to provide\ndefinitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific T cell immunity and the re-establishment of a state of\nimmune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these systems\nis a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive populations\nand the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. These inhibitory pathways are highly\namenable to immunotherapeutic approaches after ASCT that invoke long term survival. This proposal will utilize\nsophisticated protein and transcriptional based approaches to examine the relationship of T cell function in the\nperi-transplant period to subsequent survival and disease control in well-annotated clinical cohorts. A major focus\nwill be the optimization of innovative immunotherapy approaches after ASCT in preclinical systems for clinical\ntranslation.

This approach holds\npromise to function as an effective immunotherapy against metastatic cancers in humans using monovalent\nFab fragments (Mono-Fabs) specific for the CD3 complex that is associated with the TCR. In the absence of\nstrong antigen, anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs do not stimulate T cell immune function because they do not crosslink\nreceptors for intracellular signaling. However, when exposed to antigen, T cells treated with anti-CD3 Mono-\nFabs increase their level of response to weak antigenic stimulation in vitro, indicating that the Fabs bound to\nCD3 alter the TCR/CD3 complex and enhance T cell triggering, an effect we denominate ‘receptor co-\npotentiation’. When tested in mice in vivo, anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs display therapeutic properties against\nmetastatic melanoma that depend on the presence of T cells able to recognize antigens associated with the\ntumor. Since anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs target the TCR/CD3 complex, testing combinations with alternative\nimmunotherapies that target other receptors on T cells was. Anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs showed a synergistic effect\nwith the alternative immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibition or adoptive cell therapy, which resulted in\nsignificantly extended survival of the mice tested. Now, Mono-Fabs specific for human CD3 have been\nidentified that may mediate T cell co-potentiation in vitro, as well produce anti-tumor T cell responses in two\ndifferent and ccomplementary humanized-mouse models of metastatic melanoma. In the present proposal,\ntransgenic mice expressing human CD3 will be crossed with inbred and outbred mouse strains in order to\nproduce different degrees of genetic diversity to resemble adult humans. Additionally, so called “dirty mice”\nfrom pet stores will also be co-housed with human CD3-transgenic mice to induce levels of “foreign” and\nimmune experience that better correspond with those observed in adult human immunotherapy patients. Mice\nfrom these various conditions will be used to determine the extent to which candidate anti-human CD3 Fabs\ndisplay anti-tumor potential against metastatic melanoma (aim 1), in single and combination immunotherapies\n(with checkpoint inhibition and adoptive cell theapy), as well as the extent to which immunotoxicity occurs (aim\n2). Results will inform the choice of optimal candidate(s) to subsequently undergo development for anti-cancer\ntranslational application. Finally, the CD3 signaling mechanism promoted by anti-human CD3e Fabs will be\nstudied in a mechanismtic manner to better understand T cell co-potentiation (aim 3). If successful, this project\nwill produce a novel modality of immunotherapy that may be exploited alone and/or to synergize other\nimmunotherapies, and will provide a biochemical mechanistic basis for this function. The hope is that soon\nthereafter, experimentation might advance these studies to translational application with an ultimate goal of\nhelping prolong survival of patients suffering from metastatic melanoma and additional malignancies.

project	1U01CA244452-01	U01CA244452	9869561	2019	Mechanisms of Exosome Driven Immunoregulation of Cancer Progression	Grant	PROJECT ABSTRACT:\nAntibodies against the immune checkpoint proteins PD-L1 and PD-1 have revolutionized cancer therapeutics\nresulting in durable remissions in many patients previous considered incurable. However, a majority of patients\nremain resistant and cancer types can vary greatly in their response rates. Thus, there is an urgent need to\nunderstand the variation in response in order to improve cancer care. This proposal brings together a team of\ninvestigators with complementary expertise in basic, translational, and clinical science who share the long-term\ngoal of finding novel approaches to categorize and personalize cancer treatments. Recent results from the\ninvestigators suggest a major role for the packaging of immune checkpoint proteins in exosomes underlying the\nvariation in responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors among patients. Specifically, varying amounts of PD-L1\ncan be trafficked to exosomes, which in turn can act at a distance to suppress anti-tumor T cell function, enabling\ntumor progression, even in models resistant to anti-PD-L1 treatments. The objective of this proposal is to build\non these findings by focusing on the mechanism of exosomal PD-L1 packaging, action, and resistance to\ntherapeutic antibodies. In particular, the proposal will test the overall hypothesis that tumor cells can selectively\npackage PD-L1 into exosomes that suppress T cell priming at distal sights in a fashion that is distinct from the\ncell-cell interactions of PD-L1 and PD-1 normally seen in the tumor bed. The hypothesis is premised on extensive\npreliminary data using in vitro and in vivo models showing that the relative fraction of PD-L1 packaged in\nexosomes versus retained in cells varies between cell lines, that suppression of exosomal PD-L1 can result in\nlong-term systemic anti-tumor immunity, and that exosomal PD-L1 is resistant to anti-PD-L1 antibodies. To test\nthe overall hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: 1) Uncover mechanisms underlying the selective\npackaging of PD-L1 into exosomes, 2) Evaluate the mechanistic basis of exosomal PD-L1’s impact on systemic\nimmunity, 3) Dissect how exosomal PD-L1 interacts with and regulates its target cells. In aim 1, structure/function\nand proteomic approaches are proposed to identify the regulators of PD-L1 packaging into exosomes.\nFurthermore, associations between expression of these factors and resistance to therapy will be evaluated using\nprimary patient samples. In aim 2, mouse-based immunological approaches and patient samples will be used to\ndetermine where in the immune axis exosomal PD-L1 functions. Uncovered insights will then be used to develop\na novel therapeutic approach to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. In aim 3, microscopy and functional\nstudies in in vitro models along with association studies with patient samples will be used to determine how\nexosomal PD-L1 interacts with its target cells potentially explaining its resistance to antibodies. The proposal is\nhighly significant in that it is expected to provide new fundamental knowledge that can be used to identify and\ntreat the large fraction of patients resistant to current immune therapies. While this proposal focuses on a subset\nof cancer models with a particular emphasis on prostate cancer, the paradigms uncovered are expected to be\nrelevant across most if not all tumor types.

An effective vaccine exists that can prevent\nthese cancers, but uptake of the HPV vaccine is low among young cancer survivors (fewer than 1 in 4 have\nreceived the vaccine). Lack of a healthcare provider recommendation for the HPV vaccine is the most common\nreason that cancer survivors fail to get the HPV vaccine. Strategies that are most successful in increasing HPV\nvaccine uptake in the general population focus on improving healthcare provider knowledge about the HPV\nvaccine, enhancing the skills that healthcare providers need to effectively recommend the vaccine to young\npeople and their parents, and reducing barriers to receiving the vaccine. This proposed research will evaluate\nthe effectiveness and implementation of an evidence-based intervention, adapted for use by healthcare providers\nin pediatric oncology clinics, to increase the uptake of HPV vaccine among young cancer survivors (9 to 17 years\nof age and at least one year off-therapy). If the intervention is effective in improving and sustaining increased\nuptake of the HPV vaccine in young cancer survivors, this study will contribute important information needed to\nmove forward with testing the widespread use of the intervention in pediatric oncology practices. This proposed\nresearch addresses improving healthcare delivery and clinical outcomes for cancer survivors through prevention\nof HPV-associated cancers, which are high-priority research areas for the National Cancer Institute.	17 year old;Address;Adolescent;Age;Area;Cancer Survivor;Cancer Survivorship;Caring;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Clinic;Clinical;Cluster randomized trial;Communication;Confidence Intervals;Coupled;Disease;Effectiveness;Ensure;Evidence based intervention;Feedback;Future;General Population;Geography;Guidelines;Health Personnel;Health Promotion;Health behavior;Healthcare;Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination;Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine;Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm;Human Papillomavirus;Human papilloma virus infection;Hybrids;Immune;Immunization;Intervention;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Mission;Morbidity - disease rate;National Cancer Institute;Neoplasms;Odds Ratio;Oncogenic;Oncology;Outcome;Outcomes Research;Parents;Patients;Pediatric Oncology;Population;Prevention;Provider;Public Health;Randomized;Recommendation;Recovery;Research;Research Priority;Sampling;Secondary Cancer Prevention;Series;Survivors;Testing;Time;Training;United States National Institutes of Health;Vaccination;Vaccines;Vulnerable Populations;age group;cancer therapy;care providers;cervical and anal cancer;childhood cancer survivor;chronic infection;design;disability;effectiveness evaluation;effectiveness testing;evidence base;follow-up;health care delivery;health disparity;high risk;implementation science;implementation strategy;improved;intervention program;peer;post intervention;prevent;skills;success;survivorship;therapy development;uptake;young cancer survivor	UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM	BIRMINGHAM	AL	UNITED STATES	James  Klosky,WENDY  LANDIER	DCCPS	Genevieve M Grimes	1856897	>=$1M	1856897	18-Sep-2020	18-Sep-2020	31-Aug-2023	RFA-CA-19-033	Moonshot
project	1U01CA246568-01	U01CA246568	9892593	2019	Utility of memantine in preventing cognitive dysfunction in children receiving cranial radiotherapy	Grant	ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether oral memantine daily for 6 months, when compared to\nplacebo, is associated with reduction in decline of cognitive function at 12 months in children ages 4-18\nreceiving cranial radiotherapy (RT) for primary central nervous system tumors and to correlate protective\neffects of memantine with imaging biomarkers. Radiotherapy is a proven curative therapeutic tool in the\ntreatment of primary brain tumors. However, cranial RT results in significant cognitive morbidity. The\nmechanisms of radiation-induced injury result in a picture that is a combination of the small vessel disease\nseen with vascular dementia as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s dementia. Ischemia\nand injury can induce excessive NMDA stimulation and lead to excitotoxicity, and pre- clinical data suggests\nthat selective blocking of the NMDA receptor can restore long-term potentiation and restore learning in both\nmodels of ischemia as well as models of radiation injury. Memantine is a non- competitive, low-affinity, open-\nchannel NMDA blocker, which has been shown to be neuroprotective in pre- clinical models. In two placebo-\ncontrolled phase III trials, memantine proved to be effective treatment for Alzheimer’s and vascular\ndementia, especially for patients with small-vessel disease. Memantine has also proven effective in reducing\ncognitive dysfunction in adults receiving whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases. Memantine delayed\ntime to cognitive decline and reduced the rate of decline in memory, executive function and processing\nspeed. Importantly, cognitive function in patients receiving memantine remained stable even after\nmemantine was discontinued; suggesting memantine had a protective effect rather than simply a therapeutic\neffect. In this study, we propose evaluating the efficacy of memantine in preventing cognitive dysfunction in\npediatric patients receiving cranial radiation through the clinical trial mechanism of the Children’s Oncology\nGroup. This study is novel in that children will undergo early cognitive evaluations (baseline prior to\nradiation, 3, 6, and 12 months post-radiation) with a brief computerized testing battery that we will correlate\nwith formal cognitive testing as well with long-term cognitive function (30 and 60 months) assessed with both\nmethods. If successful, this study will provide validated early cognitive assessment time points that correlate\nwith late cognitive toxicity and result in an framework for accelerated study design that will allow for early\nassessment of efficacy for future neuro-protectant trials. Dose- and volume-dependent reduction in brain\nvolume is seen after radiotherapy exposure and is associated with cognitive decline. We hypothesize that\nneuroprotection with memantine will also preserve relevant brain volume and this will correlate with domain-\nspecific improvements in cognitive function. We will use quantitative volumetric MRI analysis to correlate\nprotective effects of memantine with brain substructure (white matter, hippocampus, frontal lobes etc) volume\nchanges over time and correlate with cognitive assessments. Radiographic analysis will provide proof-of-\nprinciple for the mechanism of action of memantine as well as a biomarker that can be utilized in future trials\nof radio-protectants, which is especially important for young patients or patients not neurologically capable of\ncompleting cognitive assessments but who may benefit the most from neuroprotective interventions.

project	1U01CA246612-01	U01CA246612	9893629	2019	Using Information Technology to Improve Outcomes for Children Living with Cancer	Grant	This application plans to develop a program, Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and\nReporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS), to enable timely mitigation and management of\nunrelieved symptoms for children with cancer. The SyMon-SAYS will administer, score, interpret and display\nthe results of symptom assessments in “real-time” between clinic visits in cancer care ambulatory settings,\nwhen patients are likely to be more symptomatic. We hypothesize that this system can facilitate prompt\nidentification of problematic symptoms; consequently, with the availability of graphical symptom reports over\ntime, timely providers’ clinical care, and an informative symptom management booklet, patients will become\ninformed about their condition and take an active role in treatment, which will further improve self-management\nskills. Better self-management promotes adherence to treatment plans, builds individual capacity, improves\ninteraction between patients and caregivers, reduces the use of medical specialists, and optimizes clinical\noutcomes across the lifespan throughout the treatment and disease continua. The proposed waitlist control\nrandomized trial is based on our preliminary study testing the feasibility of the patient-centered SyMon-SAYS in\na pediatric oncology clinic. Results showed that the SyMon-SAYS was acceptable to patients/parents and they\nwere willing to use it during their routine clinical care. Clinicians expressed interest in receiving reports yet\npreferred to review them in the medical record. Based on what we learned from this pilot, we now propose to\nintegrate the SyMon-SAYS system into the electronic health record (EHR), to streamline the alert notification\nwith clinician workflow by using EHR (Epic) messaging, and to include a broader range of symptoms. Patients\nand parents will complete the weekly symptom assessment and review the symptom report by logging into the\nEpic MyChart patient portal. Instead of using a standalone SyMon-SAYS app, we will align the SyMon-SAYS\nprogram with the Epic EHR. We plan to conduct a single institution modified waitlist control randomized trial of\n200 children (ages 8-17) with cancer over 16 weeks (Group A: 16-week SyMon-SAYS intervention; Group B:\n8-week usual care and then 8-week SyMon-SAYS intervention) to achieve the following specific aims: 1)\nevaluate effectiveness of SyMon-SAYS at week-8 and its maintenance effects at week-16. We hypothesize\nthat Group A (versus Group B) will report decreased parent-perceived barriers to managing their children’s\nsymptoms, decreased patient symptom burden, increased patient and parent self-efficacy, and ultimately\nincreased patient HRQOL at week-8 and no significant differences between Groups A & B at week-16; 2)\nevaluate influential factors to Aim 1, including contextual patient and parent factors, adherence to the SyMon-\nSAYS intervention, and symptom communication; and 3) evaluate predictors of adherence to the SyMon-SAYS\nintervention and preference of SyMon-SAYS versus usual care.

To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections,\nalmost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and\ncommunities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and\naffordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and\nmore likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies\namong AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating\nthat the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing\nPA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0-\n20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the\nefficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal\nlevel) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a\nprivate Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community\nlevel) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA\ntracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other\nactivities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be\nrecruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site\nRCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group,\nto achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 -\nTo improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life.\nAnalyses of hypothesized mediation factors for Aims 1-3 and post-trial qualitative interviews among participants\nwith and without private health insurance will provide explanatory knowledge to help refine intervention\nprocedures and tailor the intervention for future RCTs among patient subgroups who will most benefit. If shown\nto be efficacious, this mHealth intervention to improve PA in AYA survivors is highly scalable because\nsmartphones and social media are widespread, PA trackers are popular and affordable, goal setting can be\nautomated, and social media activities do not require specialized staff.

Although cytokine release\nsyndrome and neurotoxicity are the earliest and most dramatic immune related adverse events (irAEs) after\nCARTx, severe manifestations are transient and only affect a minority of patients. In contrast, on-target, off-\ntumor depletion of non-malignant B lineage cells affects the majority of patients and all long-term responders.\nCD19 expression declines as B cells differentiate into plasma cells, whereas BCMA is selectively expressed by\nplasma cells. Since plasma cells are responsible for maintaining long-lived antibodies and naïve/memory B cells\nare important for generating new immunity, CD19 versus BCMA-CARTx may differentially affect preexisting\nimmunity and vaccine responses. Dr. Hill’s goal is to understand the long-term effects of CARTx on humoral\nimmunity. This proposal incorporates the expertise of an outstanding group of researchers in infectious diseases,\nimmuno-oncology, epidemiology, laboratory medicine, and statistics who are dedicated to ensuring the success\nof this innovative research proposal. They will leverage their expertise and high-volume immunotherapy\nprograms to achieve the following aims.\nThe first Aim involves a prospective observational cohort study of 130 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 50\npediatric CD19, 30 adult BCMA) with relapse-free survival ≥6 months. Dr. Hill will use a novel systematic viral\nepitope scanning method (VirScan) to longitudinally characterize the antivirome to 206 viral pathogens. These\nresults will describe, and identify correlates of, antivirome diversity metrics at 6- and 12-months post-CARTx.\nVirScan will allow for a nuanced assessment of the differential impacts of CARTx on humoral immune\ncompetence. The second Aim will utilize samples from Aim 1 to determine the effect of CARTx on the durability\nof preexisting humoral immunity to vaccine-preventable infections and the proportion of patients lacking\nseroprotection after CARTx. These data will expand on Aim 1 to inform vaccination strategies. In the third Aim,\nDr. Hill will perform a prospective observational study of 95 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 25 pediatric CD19,\nand 20 adult BCMA) to define the frequency and correlates of positive vaccine responses ≥6 months after\nCARTx. Patients will be vaccinated for S. pneumoniae, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, H. influenza b, and\nhepatitis A and B according to institutional guidelines.\nThis proposal will address critical knowledge gaps by employing innovative methods to elucidate the scope of\npathogen-specific deficits in humoral immunity, and whether vaccination can mitigate these irAEs, after CARTx.\nThe findings will guide evidence-based strategies for infection prevention, such as vaccination or immunoglobulin\nreplacement, to improve outcomes in this rapidly growing population of high-risk individuals.

project	1U01CA247573-01	U01CA247573	9921971	2020	Engineering immunotherapeutic probiotics to mitigate irAE	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nIn recent years, the field of cancer immunotherapy has seen a renaissance – with the use of monoclonal\nantibodies that target immune checkpoints to activate anticancer immune responses demonstrating unparalleled\nclinical success. Several of these therapies have now gained FDA approval and are part of routine treatment\nregimens for several malignancies. Despite the overall success of immunotherapeutic regimens, existing\nmodalities present complications that current research efforts seek to overcome: (1) systemic delivery of\ncheckpoint blockade monoclonal antibodies lead to diverse and unpredictable immune-related adverse events\n(irAE), (2) boosting responses from the endogenous antitumor repertoire often relies on the existence of pre-\nprimed antitumor T cells, which in the case of highly immunosuppressive tumors or those with low mutational\nburden may be extremely rare, and (3) attempts to combine immunotherapies to additively boost T cell responses\ndemonstrate increased on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Thus, to circumvent toxicity and immunosuppression,\ncontemporary strategies focus on developing methods to deliver potent immunostimulants directly into a tumor,\nlocally priming antitumor T cells to attack disseminated metastases exhibiting a similar antigenic profile. Bridging\nthese observations, the goals of this proposal are to engineer probiotic strains of bacteria that selectively colonize\ncolorectal cancer (CRC) and locally release immune checkpoint blockade. We hypothesize that this approach\nwill result in more robust and diversified antitumor T cell immunity and promote the clearance of colonized\nprimary and metastatic colorectal cancer lesions and systemically growing CRC-derived foci. The primary\ninnovations of this proposal are in engineering probiotics as an immunotherapeutic delivery vector to locally\nrelease high-dose immune checkpoint blockade. Specifically, the proposed system has several advantages over\ncurrent therapeutic strategies, including: (1) tumor-specific production of immunotherapies and LPS adjuvant,\n(2) bacteria lysis, leading to effective release of novel immunotherapeutics and LPS, (3) local delivery of novel\nimmunotherapeutics that are toxic to deliver systemically, and (4) oral delivery of probiotics that selectively\ncolonize CRC metastases. This work seeks to shift current research and clinical practice paradigms to overcome\ncurrent limitations of immunotherapies, by providing a unique vehicle to locally deliver immunotherapies that\nstimulate antitumor immunity while preventing systemic toxicity and mitigating irAE.

project	1U01CA247576-01	U01CA247576	9921965	2020	Adrenergic modulation of cellular immune functions in CAR T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome	Grant	Immunotherapy using tumor-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells (CART) is a rapidly-\nemerging, promising cancer therapy that can elicit rapid, durable clinical responses, seen in anti-CD19 CART\n(CART19)-treated CD19+ B-cell malignancies. However, CART-evoked severe or fatal immune-related adverse\nevents (irAE) including cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) are significant clinical barriers and safety concerns\nthat impede CART use in cancer patients, even with strict patient monitoring and supportive care. Current tools\nfor mitigating such immunotoxicities/CRS target individual cytokines/receptors (e.g. IL-6R, IL-1Ra, GM-CSF) or\nnonspecific immunosuppression, but preventing and treating such toxicity will require better understanding of\ncellular/molecular mediators of CART-induced CRS. This project aims to overcome these barriers and enable\nmore effective interventions against immunotoxicities, and thus more effective CART treatments, building upon\nthe PIs' novel, potentially translatable findings of a key role of catecholamines (CATs) in shaping CART therapy-\nassociated immune activation. We found that blocking CAT synthesis both reduced CRS during CART therapy\nin mice and also enhanced its tumor eradication, and also found that CAT levels are elevated in patients with\nCART-evoked CRS, and correlated with symptoms and IL-6 levels, suggesting CATs contribute to human CRS\npathophysiology. The project's goal is to identify the mechanistic CRS-modulating roles of these novel CAT\nactions and their impacts on macrophages and anti-tumor responses, and assess translational potential for\nimproving CART cancer therapy outcomes using human patient samples. Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the\nmediating α1-AR subtype and its role in modulating CART-evoked cytokine release and anti-tumor responses in\nvitro and in vivo, based on our finding that CAT-associated cytokine release is mediated by α1-adrenergic\nreceptors (α1-AR), of as-yet unknown subtype(s). We will identify the α1-AR subtype(s) that mainly mediate(s)\nCAT-evoked cytokine production in macrophages and CART, using in vitro co-culture assays and a mouse CART\ntherapy model via genetic knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) of α1-AR subtypes. 2) Determine the impact of\nmyeloid-derived CATs on cytokine release and myeloid function during CART-therapy in vitro and in a mouse\nmodel, by inactivating CAT synthesis in myeloid cells via tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) KO, and assess its impact\non cytokine release and macrophage function in a co-culture assay and in vivo using a LysM-Cre-mediated TH\nKO mouse. 3) Assess CAT induction in human patients during CART therapy, and CATs' dual impacts on irAE\nand tumor responses, and potential utility of CAT measures and blockers in predicting and preventing CRS, by\nquantifying circulating CAT and cytokine levels in patient serum samples collected during CART therapy, and\nevaluating correlations of CAT levels with clinical and laboratory CRS indices, anti-tumor responses and survival.

To date, most cancer research has employed established cancer cell lines and\ngenetically engineered mouse models. Although these models have provided tremendous insight into many\naspects of cancer initiation and progression, each of these models has important limitations, including adaptation\nto culture (cell lines), lack of genomic instability (mouse models), and inadequate representation of the spectrum\nof mutations and subtypes of human cancers. Next generation cancer models (NGCMs) such as organoid\nmodels have recently been developed. NGCMs address many deficits of prior models and promise to accelerate\ncancer research and experimental therapeutic efforts.\n Recent methodological advances now make it possible to create patient-derived cancer cell lines and\norganoids with increased efficiency. When coupled with genomic analysis, these new models may facilitate new\ninsights into human cancers. However, organoids require complex culture conditions and display distinct\nproperties that pose challenges for implementation of standard molecular and cell biology techniques. To\nfacilitate widespread use of organoid models within the research community, we must develop innovative\ntechnologies to overcome these challenges and enable study of organoids for a range of cancer phenotypes.\n In this Project, we will build on our expertise in the development of genome scale and informatic methods as\nwell as our work to derive many of the HCMI models with the goal of developing high throughput approaches to\nperform genetic and small molecule screens in patient-derived organoids created by the Human Cancer Models\nInitiative (HCMI). In addition, we will use innovative methods to interrogate cell state plasticity and heterogeneity\nin these models. These studies will allow the cancer research community to perform both high and low throughput\nanalyses in patient-derived models and to provide deep insight into the stability and phenotypes represented by\nthese models. While we will focus our technology development efforts using pancreatic cancer organoids, we\nanticipate that the approaches developed in this proposal will be widely applicable to many different models from\na range of cancer types.\n In Aim 1, we will develop and implement a highly multiplexed method to screen patient-derived organoid\nmodels with both small molecules and genetic reagents. These studies will provide a powerful approach to\ninterrogating HCMI models at high throughput. In Aim 2, we will build on our preliminary studies that indicate that\npatient-derived organoids exhibit heterogeneity and rapid shifts in expressed phenotypes. We will interrogate\nthe dynamics of these state changes and assess the degrees of heterogeneity in these models using newly\ndeveloped physical and sequencing methodology. In Aim 3, we will build on Project Achilles and the DepMap\n(www.DepMap.org) to create and implement an optimized genome scale CRISPR-Cas9 library that permits the\nsystematic genetic interrogation of genetic dependencies in patient-derived organoids.\n We anticipate that these studies will create new methods that permit rigorous evaluation of HCMI models as\nwell as the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer. More broadly, these\nstudies will provide critical proof of principle that these methods can be used by others to study specific\nphenotypes in next generation cancer models such as organoids.

These Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter\nOrganoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) include: Synthetic Promoter\nActivated Recombination of Kaleidoscopic Organoids (SPARKO), Combinatorial Genetics En\nMasse (CombiGEM), and single-cell RNA sequencing panorama (Scanorama). SPARKO can annotate\nheterogeneous cancer populations in living cells via fluorescent protein expression libraries to make multi-\ncolored tumor organoids. CombiGEM can rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets via large-scale,\nmassively parallel, and unbiased combinatorial genetic screens. Scanorama can integrate the analysis\nof large datasets of single-cell transcriptomics via sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. These tools\nfocus on barcoding strategies to enable accurate tracking and analysis of individual tumor cells that harbor\ndistinct genetic aberrations, and substantially expand the utility of the Next Generation Cancer Models\n(NGCMs) for cancer mechanistic investigations or therapeutic discovery. The StarOrchard tools enable\ntargeted genetic perturbations in annotated heterogeneous tumor phenotypes without destroying cells for\nsequencing. These tools will be applied to a large number and variety of NGCMs to optimize experimental\nprotocol. To ensure success, we have convened an outstanding team: PI Timothy K. Lu, MD, PhD, has\nmade strikingly original contributions to Synthetic Biology tools that enable high-throughput genetic\ninterrogation of cancer cell drug dependency; PI Ömer Yilmaz, MD, PhD, has extensive expertise in cancers\nof the gastrointestinal tract and has developed novel technologies to maintain patient-derived colon cancer\norganoids for in vivo modeling; and PI Bonnie Berger, PhD, will use her expertise in bioinformatics and\nher Scanorama algorithm to integrate data across all tumor types based on dynamic single cell RNA\nsequencing (scRNAseq). We are also supported by leading experts in cancer biology and various cancer\ntypes at both the basic science and clinical oncology frontiers of cancer research.

Historical cancer cell lines have been selected for their rapid proliferation\non tissue culture plastic, which has made them amenable to high throughput screening such as genome-wide\nCRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screens. However, the historical lines have large gaps in their representation of the\ndiversity of human cancer, and they may lack physiological relevance given their optimization for rapid\nproliferation. Next generation HCMI models address these concerns, but will require the development of new\nmethods to make them useful. Specifically, standard approaches to genome editing (involving first creating Cas9-\nstably expressing lines and then introducing guide RNAs) will not work for slowly proliferating cells often growing\nin 3D. We will therefore develop all-in-one genome editing vector systems that will make it possible to bring the\npower of genome editing to HCMI models. In addition, standard viability read-outs of such “drop-out” screens\ninvolve the growth of cells over many population doublings. But for slowly proliferating HCMI models, alternative\nreadouts will be required for efficient screening. We will therefore develop short-term single cell RNA sequencing\n(scRNAseq) methods that will serve as surrogate read-outs for long-term viability. Given the clinical annotation\nassociated with HCMI models, there is also enormous opportunity to expand the use of these models beyond\nviability measures to more complex, physiologically relevant phenotypes such as organ-specific metastatic\npotential. We will therefore develop methods that make it possible to determine the metastatic potential for next\ngeneration cancer models, and we will create a public resource of the metastasis map (MetMap) for at least 50\nHCMI models. All data and protocols will be made publicly available without restriction, all reagents will be made\navailable via Addgene, and all modified models made available to ATCC for distribution. Importantly, throughout\nthe project, all cell models will be rigorously monitored for evidence of genetic and epigenetic drift. At the\nconclusion of the proposed project, we expect to have generated a set of tools and data that will help propel the\nfuture of cancer precision medicine based on next generation cancer models.	3-Dimensional;Address;Bar Codes;Benchmarking;Brain;CRISPR screen;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Model;Cancer cell line;Cell model;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Communities;Complex;Computational Science;Consumption;Data;Development;Dropout;Ensure;Enzymes;Epigenetic Process;Future;Gene Expression Profiling;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Screening;Growth;Guide RNA;Human;Immunodeficient Mouse;Injections;Kidney;Knock-out;Libraries;Liver;Lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organ;Organoids;Outcome;Phenotype;Physiological;Population;Proliferating;Protocols documentation;Reagent;Research;Resources;System;Systems Biology;Time;Translational Research;Ultrasonography;anticancer research;base;bone;cell growth;cost;experimental study;functional genomics;gene discovery;genome editing;genome-wide;high throughput screening;in vivo;innovation;model development;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;next generation;patient response;precision medicine;precision oncology;scale up;screening;single-cell RNA sequencing;targeted treatment;technology development;tissue culture;tool;tumor;tumor microenvironment;vector	BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.

project	1U01CA254822-01	U01CA254822	10086540	2020	A population-based virtual solution to reduce gaps in genetic risk evaluation and management in families at high risk for hereditary cancer syndromes:  The Georgia-California GeneLINK Trial	Grant	Project Abstract: There is growing evidence that targeting genetic risk evaluation (GRE) in families where a\ncancer susceptibility gene pathogenic variant (PV) has been identified may be the most cost-effective\napproach to reduce the population burden of cancer through prevention. However, there are enormous\nchallenges to implementing successful cascade genetic risk evaluation in families with hereditary cancer\nsyndromes. The clinical context of GRE after cancer diagnosis is increasingly complex: As MGP testing has\nbecome the norm, guideline organizations have converged on a list of >40 cancer susceptibility genes in which\nPVs are clinically actionable, with wide variability in cancer threat and a myriad of strategies for prevention and\nearly detection. A daunting challenge is that the cancer patient is responsible for communication and\nengagement of relatives for GRE. Despite the shared health threat among at risk relatives (ARRs), the social\nand contextual factors that affect family communication are complex. Furthermore, ARRs are dispersed world-\nwide and receive care in disparate health care practices. Importantly, there is little incentive and limited\nresources for clinicians to engage cancer patients’ relatives and genetic counseling services are increasingly\nstrained. Given the lack of guidance for families, it is not surprising that most ARRs of cancer patients with PVs\ndo not undergo GRE. We are uniquely positioned to develop and optimize a direct-to-family virtual genetic risk\nevaluation and testing solution offered to all at risk relatives of a population-based sample of adults recently\ndiagnosed with cancer in Georgia and California who tested positive for a clinically relevant PV. We will use a\nunique data infrastructure we pioneered to identify and invite a diverse cohort of cancer patients with clinically\nrelevant PVs and their families to participate in our study. We propose a 2 x 3 factorial randomized trial of 900\npatients diagnosed in 2018-2019 in the two states who had a clinically significant PV detected by genetic\ntesting that will offer genetic risk evaluation and testing to all 1st and 2nd degree relatives. We will evaluate the\neffects of two intervention design features on patient- and relative-centered outcomes: 1) the level of\npersonalized family genetic risk support (a technology assisted personally tailored patient and family member\neducation and communication tool called the Family Genetic Health Program, FGHP) vs. the FGHP plus direct\nassistance from a human FGHP Navigator); and 2) the price offered to the relatives for the genetic test\n(standard $200 vs. $100 vs. $50 per test). We will determine the independent effects of the two design\nfeatures on 1) the cancer patient’s appraisal of communication and their engagement with relatives about\nhereditary cancer and GRE; 2) the invited relative’s appraisal of decision-making and receipt of genetic testing;\nand 3) on the enrolled relative’s completion of formal GRE. We will also explore the effect of the features on\nthe outcomes across patient SES subgroups. The findings of this study have enormous potential to improve\ncancer prevention and early detection in families at high risk of hereditary cancer syndromes in the US.

Rather, it is critical to access\nappropriate follow-up care that may include cancer risk management (CRM) options for\nindividuals and their at-risk family members. Current gaps in implementation of\nguideline-adherent follow-up care based on inherited cancer genetic test results include\nboth over and under treatment among those with pathogenic and likely pathogenic\n(P/LP) variants or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Furthermore, we are missing\nthe opportunity to magnify the uptake and impact of testing among family members who\nare at high risk due to suboptimal family communication (FC) of genetic test results and\ncancer family history. Our highly innovative and practice-changing study is designed to\nshift the paradigm by which individuals with P/LP variants and VUS in inherited cancer\ngenes are provided with information to enhance guideline-adherent CRM and FC of test\nresults. Through our proposed type I effectiveness-implementation hybrid randomized\ncontrol mixed methods study, we will test two interventions with a diverse group of 600\nindividuals with a P/LP variant or a VUS result in a variety of inherited cancer genes for\nwhich CRM guidelines are available. Intervention A is focused on increasing guideline-\nadherent CRM (LivingLabReport), and Intervention B is focused on increasing FC and\nsubsequent family testing (GeneSHARE). Alongside developing, refining, and testing\ninterventions to improve guideline-adherent CRM and FC, we will study the\nimplementation of these interventions across racially, geographically, and socio-\neconomically diverse populations and settings. The information gathered through testing\neffectiveness and implementation of the interventions will be used to develop, modify\nand pilot test adaptive stepped interventions with the potential to efficiently maximize\neffectiveness in improving guideline-adherent CRM and FC. This transdisciplinary effort,\nenriched for accrual of Blacks, rural dwellers, and other underserved populations, will\ninform policy and the development of scalable models for delivering evidence-based\ncare. Ultimately, our study will help address the need for access to effective information\nto guide CRM and enhance FC in diverse populations across various genes and settings\nwhich is greatly needed if the population at large is to benefit from genomic advances in\nthis era of personalized medicine.

Methods for their reliable identification in\ntumors of moderate mutational burden such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are lacking,\nhowever, as are preclinical experimental platforms for utilizing human material to understand the possibilities\nand impediments in enabling NeoAg-specific T cells to eradicate established tumors. Working with a focused\nand collaborative team with expertise in cellular and molecular immunology, bioinformatics, and translational\noncology, we have developed a set of novel tools and approaches to address the complex tumor/immune\necosystem in new and incisive ways. These include a unique new model of tobacco-induced HNSCC\ncarcinogenesis which recapitulates many key features of the human disease including gene expression patterns\nof activated oncogenes, a powerful new combined bioinformatic and functional analysis platform the identification\nof NeoAg by these tumors can be recognized by the host immune system, a novel preclinical model of\ncombination radio-immunotherapy through which NeoAg-specific responses can be induced and sustained\n(Sharabi/Sharma), and finally, a new preclinical model of tumor-induced unresponsiveness in the setting of\nadoptive cellular therapy using human HNSCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors and patient-matched\ntumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) specific for an identified NeoAg. Together, these studies will address the\nhypothesis that autologous NeoAg-specific T cells can eradicate HNSCC tumors as well as defining the key\nquantitative and qualitative parameters governing therapeutic efficacy.

project	1U01DE028233-01	U01DE028233	9625949	2018	Targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and immuno-radiotherapy for oral cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT:\nRadiation therapy (RT) is a mainstay of cancer treatment. However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it\npossible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence\nat a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor\ncells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune-\nstimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine\nRT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the\ntypes of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating\neffects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral\ncancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived\nsuppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate.\nStudies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an\nimmunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti-\ntumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor\nmicroenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of\ntumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1)\ndetermine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer\nto RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the\nimmunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug\nformulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will\naccomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims:\nIn Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance\nin mouse oral cancer models.\nIn Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment\nwith RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses.\nIn Aim 3 we will develop a novel drug delivery system that can enhance delivery of inhibitors of MDSC function\ndirectly to the tumor and tumor-infiltrating MDSC.

project	1U01DE029188-01	U01DE029188	9869230	2019	Defining mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nPD1 checkpoint blockade with nivolumab or pembrolizumab has given new hope for poor prognosis\nrecurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, but response rates of only\n15-20% highlight the need for continued investigation. In this application, we have assembled a\nmultidisciplinary team to address tumor cell intrinsic and adaptive resistance programs that are a critical barrier\nto immunotherapy. Together, this targeted and discovery based approach coupled with human functional\nimmunophenotyping aims to generate new translational approaches to improving response rates for HNSCC\npatients. The foundation of this proposal is based on supporting data showing robust preclinical modeling\nplatforms that span the spectrum of clinical responses to anti-PD1 therapy including response, intrinsic and\nadaptive resistance. Using high dimensional time of flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and an isogenic model of\nresponse and resistance, we identified distinct tumor microenvironmental remodeling with anti-PD1 and anti-\nCTLA4 therapies. We also completed a genome scale CRISPR screen for T cell recognition in a PD1 resistant\nHNSCC model and identified 355 candidate genes that may regulate this interaction. Candidates included\nones that may be relevant in all cancers as well as ones specific to HNSCCs. A major category to emerge from\nthis and other screens represents targets in the chromatin accessibility pathway. We validated a top screen\ncandidate that modulates chromatin accessibility, the histone methyltransferase and transcriptional regulator\nEzh2, and identified reduced anti-PD-1 resistance in combination with Ezh2 targeting. These data illustrate the\nvalidity of our approach as well as potential for clinical translation, as agents targeting Ezh2 are currently in\nclinical development. In a separate study of immunotherapy treated HNSCC patients, we identified mutations\nin SMARCA4, a catalytic subunit key for the PBAF nucleosome remodeling complex, in immunotherapy\nresponsive HNSCC patients, highlighting chromatin remodelers as modulators of immunotherapy response in\npatients and the potential for improved clinical management by targeting these activities in conjunction with\nimmunotherapy. In the proposed work, we will complete analysis of Ezh2 targeting with further validation of\ncandidate immunotherapy resistance modulators. Coupled with these preclinical studies we will complete\nfunctional immunophenotyping of human HNSCC patients using CyTOF and a novel patient derived\norganotypic platform. In parallel to these preclinical approaches, we have a strong clinical trial portfolio\nincluding a novel neoadjuvant pembrolizumab clinical trial that has shown surprising pathologic response in a\nsubset of patients and highlights this approach as an ideal setting in which to address resistance mechanisms\nin previously untreated patients. We will interrogate genomic data from our neoadjuvant trial to assess\nresistance mechanisms defined in preclinical models. In conclusion, this integrated approach will define\nmechanistic and therapeutic approaches to address the intrinsic immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC.

However, over 85% of the patients cannot benefit from this strategy, largely due to the highly\nimmunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in established cancers. Oral leukoplakias / Oral Epithelial\nDysplasias (OEDs) precede HNC and offer a unique time window for disease eradication. However, surgical\nresection in the orofacial region results in significant morbidity and function loss, and more importantly, cannot\nreverse field cancerization. A subset of OEDs transform into malignancy despite vigilant follow-ups. Frequent\nimmune cell infiltration is a common feature of OEDs, however, little is known about when and how OEDs\nevade from immuno-surveillance and reach a point-of-no-return. In addition, it remains unclear which sub-\ngroup of OEDs is more likely to suppress host immunity and establish themselves as high-risk lesions.\nAmplification of the chromosome locus 3q26.3 is a defining genomic feature of HNC, and two oncogenes at\nthis locus inhibit innate immune sensing pathways and elicit a metabolic restraint in the TME, which collectively\ndisadvantage anti-tumor immune cells. We have developed strategies to bypass the inhibition of innate\nimmune sensing and synthesized a novel drug-like molecule that exhibits potent metabolic remodeling\npotential and anti-tumor activity in vivo. We constructed two unique genetically engineered mouse models,\nwhich can model a spectrum of OED/HNC lesions with high-fidelity histologic and immunophenotypic\nresemblance to human diseases, to recapitulate 3q26.3-driven OED transformation. We also identified unique\ncollections of case-control and longitudinal paired OED/HNC specimens, which allow us to validate key\nfindings on the temporal shift of exploitable immune targets with clinical specimens. The overarching goal of\nthis translational program is to test the hypothesis that 3q26.3 amplification is a key early high-risk event that\nleads to OED immune escape and that a combination of metabolic remodeling agent with immunotherapy\neffectively prevents OED progression. Thus, this proposal is fully responsive to the RFA-CA-19-014 and is\nfocused on the deeper understanding of the time-course of immune landscape shift as pre-malignant lesions\nprogress, using 3q26.3 amplification-driven OEDs as a high-risk disease model. We will qualify a novel\nmetabolic remodeling drug-like molecule as a priming agent to maximally improve immuno-prevention. The\n3q26.3 amplification is not unique to HNC and commonly found in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung,\nesophagus and skin, hence, our findings will help address a broad class of public health concerns.	3q26;Address;Agonist;Automobile Driving;Bypass;CD8B1 gene;Cells;Chromosomes;Clinical;Collection;Cross-Priming;Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes;Dendritic Cells;Disadvantaged;Disease;Disease model;Effector Cell;Epithelial;Erythroplasia;Esophageal carcinoma;Event;Excision;Exhibits;Gene Expression Profile;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Glucose;Glycolysis;Glycolysis Pathway;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Histologic;Human;Hypoxia;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immune response;Immunity;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;Infiltration;Interferon Type I;Interferons;Intraepithelial Neoplasia;Lead;Lesion;Longitudinal cohort;Lymphocyte;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic stress;Modeling;Molecular Profiling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mucous Membrane;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oral;Oral Leukoplakia;PIK3CA gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Premalignant;Prevention;Prevention strategy;Public Health;Regimen;Resolution;Signal Transduction;Skin Carcinoma;Specimen;Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma;Stains;Subgroup;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Time;Tumor Burden;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Warburg Effect;cancer cell;case control;combinatorial;design;effective therapy;extracellular;head and neck cancer patient;high risk;high risk population;human disease;immune activation;immune checkpoint blockade;improved;in vivo;individualized medicine;inhibitor/antagonist;loss of function;malignant mouth neoplasm;mutant;novel;novel therapeutics;oral cavity epithelium;orofacial;prevent;programs;public health relevance;recruit;response;restraint;tumor;tumor hypoxia;tumor microenvironment	UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR	ANN ARBOR	MI	UNITED STATES	John Chadwick Brenner,Yu Leo Lei,NOURI  NEAMATI	DCP	ZHONG  Chen	3799975	>=$1M	2516200	25-Sep-2019	24-Sep-2019	31-Aug-2024	RFA-CA-19-014	Moonshot
project	1U01DK124165-01	U01DK124165	9928257	2020	Characterizing and predicting colitis in immune checkpoint blockade-treated cancer patients	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\n The first combination immunotherapy of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) approved for\nmelanoma in 2015 has achieved longer progression-free survival compared to nivolumab alone (11.5 vs. 6.9\nmonths), with 53% of patients still alive at 4 years, of whom 71% remain treatment free. Yet, safety is the\nbiggest barrier to broader implementation of this successful combination, due to much greater occurrence of\nserious immune-related adverse events (irAEs) compared to nivolumab alone. In particular, immune-related\ncolitis (irColitis) is the most common occurrence, with 10-15% of patients developing it upon receiving anti-\nCTLA-4 alone or in combinations. Such irColitis is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment with high-\ndose steroids or biologics such as anti-TNF, as well as ipilimumab or immunotherapy discontinuation. These\nsafety concerns have hampered the development of CTLA-4 targeting agents and may have reduced their\nefficacy due to lower recommended dosing in combination therapy and limited treatment course. There is\ntherefore an urgent need to comprehensively study the nature of irColitis and find whether potential risk factors\ncould be identified and mitigated for greater safety and efficacy of combination treatments.\n We have assembled a unique team of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) scientists and clinicians, tumor\nimmunologists, microbiome specialists, and medical oncologists specializing in immunotherapy of melanoma to\nanalyze colorectal tissue lesions, the gut microbiome, and peripheral blood biomarkers that could predict or\ncontribute to development of irColitis. By comparing what we already learned from studying biospecimens of\nIBD patients, i.e., their genetic subsets at the single cell level, gut microbiome, and predictive immune\nsignatures, we aim to characterize the transcriptomic, immunopathologic, serologic, and gut microbiome\nlandscape of irColitis and leverage this knowledge for better therapeutic options.\n We will address irColitis by characterizing gut biopsies of melanoma patients during treatment using single-\ncell RNA sequencing and multiplex immunohistochemistry mapping, and we will relate immune subsets and\nmarkers discovered to those found in IBD lesions. We will also measure peripheral blood serologic markers\n(anti-microbial and anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies by ELISA, soluble cytokine and protein analytes with Olink\nproximity extension assay) that we recently found to be risk factors detectable prior to development of IBD, and\nanalyze them for their capacity to predict irColitis. From stool collected before and throughout treatment, we\nwill analyze by 16S and metagenomic sequencing the gut microbiome of melanoma patients with or without\nirColitis to compare it to known colitogenic structure in IBD, and functionally assess bacterial communities in\ngnotobiotic models. Finally, we will integrate our findings to establish a mechanistic model of irColitis compared\nto IBD, to propose novel stratifications of cancer immunotherapy patients by risk factors, and to offer future\ntherapeutic opportunities, such as actionable tissue genomic and protein targets or fecal transplants.	16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Address;Antibodies;Autoantibodies;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;CTLA4 blockade;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials Design;Colitis;Colorectal;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Crohn&apos;s disease;Data;Development;Disease remission;Dose;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Feces;Flowers;Future;Genetic;Genomics;Gnotobiotic;Goals;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immunohistochemistry;Immunologist;Immunotherapy;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Intestines;Knowledge;Lamina Propria;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical Oncologist;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibodies;Nature;Nivolumab;Patient risk;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Predictive Value;Progression-Free Survivals;Proteins;Proteomics;Risk Factors;Safety;Scientist;Serological;Serum;Serum Markers;Specialist;Specimen;Steroids;Stratification;Structure;Symptoms;TNF gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Treatment Side Effects;Ulcerative Colitis;anti-CTLA4;anti-PD-1;antimicrobial;bacterial community;base;cancer immunotherapy;clinical development;cytokine;density;fecal transplantation;frontier;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;immune checkpoint;immune checkpoint blockade;immune-related adverse events;improved;melanoma;metagenomic sequencing;microbial;microbiome;microbiome analysis;microbiome composition;novel;patient subsets;peripheral blood;predictive marker;prospective;response;serological marker;single cell analysis;single-cell RNA sequencing;targeted agent;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions	ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Jean-Frederic  Colombel,Jeremiah James Faith,Sacha  Gnjatic	DCB	Terez  Shea-Donohue	594873	$500k to $749k	397393	1-Jun-2020	1-Jun-2020	31-May-2025	RFA-CA-19-044	Moonshot

Reasons for the greater burden of aggressive disease in AA men are unknown, but are\nlikely to include a multitude of factors including social factors such as lifetime stress, inherited susceptibility, and\ntumor-related features such as somatic alterations and local inflammation in the microenvironment. The\noverarching goal of this Program Project is to uncover the social and biological factors that are related to PCa\naggressiveness in AA men. To accomplish this objective, we will establish a large, national, population-based\ncohort study, RESPOND, (Research on Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry: Defining the Roles of\nGenetics, Immunity and Social Stress) of 10,000 AA men with incident PCa identified through nine SEER and\nNPCR U.S. cancer registries from states that include 38% of all AA PCa cases in the U.S.. The cohort will provide\ncomprehensive information on multilevel stressors over the lifecourse such as discrimination, early-life adversity,\nand neighborhood disorder, including geospatial neighborhood data over time and degree of perceived stress;\n2) lifestyle factors and health behaviors; 3) disease-specific factors including PSA screening history and\ntreatment choice; 4) germline DNA to study genetic susceptibility, and 5) tumor block samples for\ncharacterization of somatic variation and immune profiling of the tumor microenvironment. No previous study\nhas attempted to obtain information across these domains in a single large sample in order to understand the\nrelative contribution of each and relationships between molecular and non-genetic components. In order to\naddress these goals, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and clinicians with established\ntrack records in PCa research. Leveraging the RESPOND resource and investigator expertise, we have\ndesigned a Program Project composed of four Projects that are supported by four Cores which are all focused\non the central theme of identifying social and biological factors related to PCa disease aggressiveness in AA\nmen. These Projects include: the investigation of multilevel social stressors across the lifecourse in relationship\nwith aggressive PCa (Project 1); genome-wide discovery efforts of germline susceptibility loci for aggressive\nPCa and examination of the relationship between germline and somatic variation (Project 2); the identification\nof underlying somatic alterations in PCa tumors and biological pathways that are related to aggressive disease\n(Project 3); and, a detailed assessment of inflammation in the tumor microenvironment as it relates to PCa\naggressiveness in AA men (Project 4). Each of the four Projects address a distinct research domain, however,\nwhen studied together, create scientific synergy and a far more comprehensive picture of the major factors that\ncontribute to aggressive PCa in AA men. The information we will discover is likely to have immediate clinical\nimplications in the areas of improved patient stratification and personalized medicine. Hence, this study has\nbroad reaching significance and addresses numerous challenges in the clinical management of PCa in AA men.

project	1U24CA224020-01	U24CA224020	9445275	2017	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC)	Grant	ABSTRACT\nIn contrast to the decline in mortality in other cancers, the incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n(PDAC) is increasing, and therapeutic approaches, for the most part, have not been successful at improving\nsurvival in patients. Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers,\ncomparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an\nimmune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune\nbarriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease.\nThe U01 “Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME” was created through the National Cancer\nMoonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC,\nespecially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24\nRFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal\nAdenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio\nWistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center\n(UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with\nrespect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental\ntherapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics),\nAndy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton\n(co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple\nareas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01\nawardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage\ncapabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing\ntranslationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support\nadministrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and\naccess to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will\nserve as the central “hub” for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we\nwill utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be\nreadily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics\nservices for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and\ndevelop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well\nas provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be\nan indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.

project	1U24CA224067-01	U24CA224067	9446207	2017	Data Coordination Center for PDX Net	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nPatient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are a powerful model system for assessing drug efficacy of anti-cancer\nagents and understanding molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. However, results from individual\nresearch groups have been difficult to validate due to the lack of standardized PDX procedures, lack of scale\nfor adequately powered PDX studies and the inability to efficiently share PDX specimens. A key contributor to\nthis challenge is the lack of well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of\nintegrated, standardized datasets from PDX models. The JAX-Seven Bridges PDX Data Commons and\nCoordination Center (PDCCC) seeks to address this challenge and unite the efforts of the component data-\ngenerating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI’s Patient-Derived\nModel Repository/PDMR) parts of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research Network (PDXNet) into\na cohesive, trans-Network whole. Using innovative cloud computing and bioinformatic approaches, our\nPDCCC will provide administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX method\nstandardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. We will build a data storage,\nsharing, and analysis platform that harmonizes PDXNet data with other large datasets and analysis workflows\navailable in the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud. Simultaneously, we will administer planning meetings, training\nactivities, and research pilots to build synergies within the PDXNet, enhancing the ability of the PDXNet to\ndevelop clinical trials from PDX studies. Our Specific Aims are to 1) establish a leadership and\nadministration unit to manage and coordinate activities within PDXNet, including annual meetings,\nregular conference calls, training activities, trans-Network pilot projects, and outreach; 2) develop a cloud-\nintegrated PDXnet Data Commons that integrates PDXNet data with the existing cloud-based data analysis\nplatform - the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC); and 3) build analysis workflows and data\nsharing practices to optimize PDXNet research and enable PDXNet data to facilitate clinical trial design. To\naccomplish these Aims we have assembled a team with unique expertise in PDXs, cancer treatment, genomic\nanalysis, data coordination, and project management from The Jackson Laboratory and Seven Bridges. Our\ncombined institutional strengths include a history of leadership in (and commitment) to PDX, data resource,\nanalytic and consensus standards development and application; practical expertise in PDX model sharing and\ncollaborative community efforts; a broad array of statistical, bioinformatic, and software-related PDX resources;\nleadership expertise in large-scale, cloud-based biomedical data projects, notably the SB-CGC; and deep\nexperience in high-performance database engineering and development. Our goal is to build an innovative,\nsystematically organized PDCCC that will advance the efforts of PDXNet to improve the validity—and expand\nuse—of the PDX system as a preclinical platform for precision oncology.

project	1U24CA224122-01	U24CA224122	9449147	2017	Coordinating Center for Canine Immunotherapy Trials and Correlative Studies	Grant	The primary mission of goal of the Pre-medical Cancer Immunotherapy Network for Canine Trials (PRECINCT) is to\nfacilitate the performance of immunotherapy clinical trials in dogs with cancer and to expedite the identification of\nimmunological correlates of successful therapeutic responses. The PRECINCT will achieve these goal by supporting\na highly coordinated clinical trials network of participating U01 sites. As a coordinating center, the PRECINCT will\nwork in consultation with U01 investigators, the Steering Committee, representatives from the Comparative\nOncology Program (COP) at NCI and an External Advisory Committee to provide expert services in project\nmanagement and research technology, data management, biostatistical support and immunological monitoring.\nSpecifically, we will establish a PRECINCT Data Coordinating Center to provide comprehensive project oversight,\nsupervise all project management and regulatory compliance activities, and coordinate site management for all\naspects of single and large multi-site projects. Through the PRECINCT, U01 investigators will have ready access to\nresearch services and standardized protocols that will facilitate the performance of clinical research across the\nPRECINCT. We will establish a PRECINCT Data Management System to collect, store and share all clinical and\ncorrelative data amongst the U01 sites and with the COP directors and Steering Committee. We will develop the\ninfrastructure necessary to achieve an efficient, highly functioning coordinated network and develop standard\noperating procedures (SOPs) that can be applied across all PRECINCT-associated U01 projects to ensure high\nquality, repeatable data sets. We will provide biostatistical support for study design and data analysis to ensure\nthat immunotherapy clinical trials performed within the network are strategically designed and appropriately\npowered to achieve meaningful clinical and laboratory data results in the most expedite way. The renowned\nexpertise of the University of Pennsylvania in both human and canine clinical trials will foster rapid translation of\nstate-of-the art methods for human clinical study design and analysis to canine clinical trials and results from\ncanine trials can rapidly inform human clinical trials, thus optimizing results for both species. Finally, the University\nof Pennsylvania is a leader in cancer immunotherapy and is also home to world renowned experts in immune\nreagent development and immunological monitoring. We will leverage this expertise to both accelerate the\nmission of the U24 and extend it by providing support for immunologic reagent development for use in correlative\nstudies and biomarker identification. In concert with U01 investigators, the COP and the Steering Committee, we\nwill design, generate and validate several multiparametric, multicolor flow panels and SOPs for their use across the\nU01 sites. Successful immunologic monitoring will allow canine cancer patients to be streamlined to single or\ncombination therapies most likely to be effective and will provide essential insight for future translational\napplication to human cancer patients.

project	1U24CA224285-01	U24CA224285	9455402	2017	Translational Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (TCIMAC)	Grant	ABSTRACT\nAdvances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various cancers. Immunotherapeutic approaches are\nbecoming the new treatment modality in some cancer types. However, clinical efficacy is still limited to a\nmarginal number of patients due to a newly developing understanding of the complex tumor microenvironment\nand a limited ability to appropriately select patients who have specific biomarker signatures and have the\npotential to optimally respond to specific immunotherapy or combination strategies. An additional challenge in\nassessment of biomarkers that show clinical utility to predict patient benefit includes the use of different\nmethodologies and platforms that make it difficult to make accurate conclusions on the biomarkers in question.\nThus, optimized biomarker strategies that can overcome immune barriers will allow tailoring of the therapeutic\napproaches and result in bold interventions that would be most beneficial to individual patients. The National\nCancer Moonshot was launched in 2016 with the goal of boldly combating cancer beyond incremental\nadvances leading to the creation of a “Cancer Immunotherapy Translational Science Network” that would\nfacilitate translational research and clinical advances in immunotherapy.  Our proposal to create a resource\ncenter, named Translational Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (TCIMAC) that will be a\ncritical resource capable of serving any of the NCI-supported clinical trial networks. The TCIMAC will be co-led\nby Drs. Ignacio Wistuba, renowned cancer surgical and molecular pathologist, Elizabeth Mittendorf, well-known\nbreast cancer surgeon and immunologist, and Chantale Bernatchez, cancer immunologist. They will be\nsupported by a team that encompasses a multidisciplinary group of world-class and highly collaborative\nexperts on cancer and immunotherapy. The main goals of TCIMAC are to: 1) provide centralized and\nharmonized services for sample collection, processing and quality assurance, and 2) use analytically-validated\nand standardized assays and platforms to offer state-of-the-art analyses for patients enrolled on NCI-\nsponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will assist in standardizing bio-banking\nactivities and share/develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing,\nquality assessment, and storage of biospecimens collected from NCI-sponsored early phase immunotherapy\nclinical trials and to link the specimens to relevant clinical, pathological, immune and molecular data within the\nTCIMAC-CIDC Network. In Aim 2, we will provide services to conduct both routine and innovative pathological,\nimmunological and molecular analyses using standardized and validated assays to aid the completion of NCI-\nsponsored trials. In Aim 3, we will provide comprehensive biostatistics and computational services for data\ncollection and analysis for each analytical platform, and to perform analyses, interpretation and predictive\nmodeling of high dimensional (`omic”) data in the context of clinical outcomes. We envision that the TCIMAC\nwill be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress in cancer immunotherapeutic approaches.

project	1U24CA224316-01	U24CA224316	9456997	2017	Cancer Immunologic Data Commons	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nCancer immunotherapies have emerged as highly promising approaches to treat cancer patients, particularly\nsince they can be applied across different tissue and cancer types, although clinical efficacy has been limited\nto a subset of cancer patients. Translational studies with strong focus on biomarkers are critical to\nunderstanding the tumor-immune interface. Although numerous technologies for tumor and immune profiling\nare applied to NCI sponsored immunotherapy trials, standardization of both assay protocols and data analysis\nmethods is crucial to data integration and comparisons across studies for biomarker identification. This\nunderlines the need for data harmonization and creation of uniform analysis pipelines.\nWe propose to establish the Cancer Immunology Data Commons (CIDC) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\nwith the goal of advancing translational research efforts using biomarkers to aid in the further\ndevelopment of cancer immunotherapy. The short-term objectives of this application are to establish and\nmanage the data repository for biomarkers and associated clinical data for Cancer Immune Monitoring\nand Analysis Centers (CIMACs), and provide an informatics environment for integrative multi-\ndimensional analysis across different studies and storage of data generated. Specifically, we propose to:\nAim 1, coordinate with the CIMAC and Laboratory Coordinating Committee (LCC) to harmonize establish\nassay protocols and data format standards; Aim 2, develop a centralized data repository and management\nsystem, and coordinate CIMAC data submission to the CIDC; Aim 3, develop uniform bioinformatics\nprocessing pipelines and computing infrastructure for computationally intensive analyses for the CIMACs and\nthe larger research community; Aim 4, provide bioinformatics algorithms to enable integrative and correlative\nanalysis of CIMAC data and integrate other accessible databases and resources for biomarker discovery; Aim\n5, develop centralized role-based data access functions with advanced programming interface to enable\nsharing of CIMAC data; Aim 6, develop interactive web visualization functions to enable investigators and the\nimmunology communities to examine the CIMAC data; and Aim 7, coordinate within the CIMACs-CIDC\nNetwork logistic and scientific activities for biomarker discovery and validation.\nAt the conclusion, we will have established a biomarker repository for all data and results generated by\nCIMACs, supplemented with standardized informatics tools for integration with other accessible databases,\nand compatible for data contribution and secondary analyses by external researchers. These efforts will\nprovide bioinformatics support for the CIMACs-CIDC Network. The established Data Commons will also\nprovide the foundation for a future immuno-oncology data resource for the larger research community.

project	1U24CA224319-01	U24CA224319	9457012	2017	High-Dimensional Immune Monitoring of NCI-Supported Immunotherapy Trials	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nImmunotherapy is transforming decades of clinical practice in cancer care, but it also comes with new\nquestions about understanding mechanisms of action contributing to both antitumor activity and potential\nassociated toxicity. Most importantly, identifying why only a fraction of patients derives clinical benefit is at the\nforefront of future developments, with the ever-elusive validation of useful clinical biomarkers as the ultimate\ngoal. As a consortium of immunologists, technologists, clinicians, computational biologists, data specialists,\nand biostatisticians, the Mount Sinai CIMAC (MS-CIMAC) is uniquely positioned to generate immune profiling\ndatasets at an unprecedented level of granularity to identify biomarker signatures of disease course and\nresponse to immunotherapy in cancer patients. MS-CIMAC will take full advantage of the smart cancer\nimmunotherapy trial designs championed by the NCI that mandate collection of baseline and on-treatment\nbiospecimens. Key strengths of MS-CIMAC are expected to be in unique high-dimensional yet sample-sparing\napproaches, including CyTOF mass cytometry, seromics, microbiome, and multiplex chromogen IHC, thanks\nto the implementation of cutting-edge yet validated protocols and analysis pipelines. Through a comprehensive\narray of assays and analytical tools that bridge innovation and standardization, MS-CIMAC intends to pursue\nthe following three aims: a) help characterize immunocompetence at baseline and assess global immune\nchanges during treatment, b) drill down the specificity and quality of immune responses for mechanistic\nevaluation of drugs, and c) automate, optimize, and integrate analyses of resulting datasets to facilitate\nsharing, and to ultimately discover composite immune biomarkers that will impact clinical cancer care.

project	1U24CA224331-01	U24CA224331	9457104	2017	Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center	Grant	Summary\nThe critical role of the immune system in effecting anti-tumor responses to traditional and molecularly-targeted\ntherapies is increasingly recognized, such that there is now an explosion of activity in the clinical investigation\nof immuno-oncology. In parallel, we have gained great advances in our ability to extract useful biologic\ninformation from patient material through the development of: (i) high-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing, that\nhas uncovered major genetic determinants of clinically-evident immune responses; (ii) highly multiplexed\nbiological assays, that have revealed the complex interplay between immunity and cancer in relation to\ntherapy; and (iii) advanced computational methods, that have enabled large-scale integrative data analysis.\nUnderlying this activity is a need to identify the critical biomarkers of response and resistance to\ntherapy in each disease and across diseases. With the rapidly evolving clinical and experimental\ndevelopments in immunotherapy occurring across all major academic centers, the need to build a coordinated\ninfrastructure for data collection, processing and analysis has emerged as a high priority. At Dana-Farber\nCancer Institute (DFCI), the Center of Immuno-Oncology (CIO) was established several years ago and is a\nlocal hub of translational immuno-oncology activity. As a part of its mission, the CIO supports dedicated\ntranslational biomarker laboratories to provide expertise in the analysis of immune correlatives in the service of\nimmuno-oncology trials. Collectively, these resources provide multidisciplinary capabilities supporting both\ninvestigator-initiated and externally-sponsored studies ranging from clinical trial design, the performance of\nwell-validated immune monitoring capabilities on patient samples during trials, the interpretation of data from\nimmune monitoring testing, and the development of novel assays based on the scientific questions motivated\nby individual clinical studies. We propose to expand the laboratory and biostatistical capabilities of the\nCIO along with those of additional DFCI units as a Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center\n(CIMAC). We want to coordinate the efforts of the proposed DFCI-CIMAC with other CIMACs and with the\nCancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) to develop the standards for designing studies rich with immune\ncorrelatives and informative for candidate biomarkers, to be tested in future trials. Aim 1 focuses on\nharmonizing the technical aspects of assays offered by the CIMACs; Aim 2 focuses on the assay-specific\nscoring analyses and reporting of CIMAC offerings. Modeled on our long history of implementing standard and\ninnovative assays to study DFCI phase I/II trials, we describe a process for using `Tier 1' `shovel-ready' assays\nthat we expect as standard components of an immune monitoring tool-kit and `Tier 2' assays that are tailored\nto the specific needs of a study (Aim 3). Altogether, these efforts fall within the concept and vision of\npersonalized medicine for immuno-oncology because only by the analyses of large well-annotated datasets\ncan we identify links between biology, molecular markers and clinical response.

Utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach, we will support Immuno-Oncology\nTranslation Network (IOTN)-funded components to discover new immune targets and evaluate novel immune-\nbased therapies and combination approaches that eliminate established cancers in adults or to prevent\ncancers before they occur. Our DMRC strategy is to serve as an administrative and analytic hub at every step\nof the IOTN's translational studies, focusing to reduce the barrier for access to analytic expertise, improve the\nproductivity of IOTN investigators, maintain a high standard for data collection and management, design and\nperform rigorous analytical strategies, and foster a collaborative and supportive research community.\nAn experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: First, we will provide\na centralized administration infrastructure to coordinate IOTN activities, building upon the NRG Oncology\nStatistical and Data Coordinating Center's experience of coordinating over 450 translational cancer studies\nacross hundreds of participating sites. Second, we will provide multidisciplinary analytic expertise to support\nIOTN collaborative research, leveraging five of RPCI CCSG's shared resources: Biostatistics, Bioinformatics,\nBiomedical Data Science, Data Bank and BioRepository, and Immune Analysis. Our analytic support will be\narmed with professional IT staff and informed by an experienced IO researcher team. Third, we will develop\ninnovative data integration methods to enhance IOTN research capacity, capitalizing on the well-respected\nBioconductor project and the independent research programs of the RPCI department of Biostatistics and\nBioinformatics. Fourth, we will actively promote the IOTN and engage in trans-consortium interactions, where\nwe will leverage Bioconductor's decade-long experience in community engagement and the NRG data center's\nrich expertise in project coordination. Leveraging our active NCI-funded RPCI-committed resource to support\nthe proposed multi-institutional trans-disciplinary IO research is not only cost-effective, but also flexible in its\nstudy-dependent scalability. Taken together, we envision that our DMRC, in close collaboration with the IOTN,\nwill allow us to conduct highly effective and innovative translational studies to address the significantly unmet\nclinical needs related to IO.

As the CC, RTI will provide leadership, scientific\nexpertise, and logistical support to unite RCs into a cohesive research group that will provide actionable\nevidence based on implementation science principles to improve symptom management across the cancer\ntreatment continuum (i.e., treatment with curative intent, treatment with noncurative/palliative intent, cancer\nsurvivorship) and address the unique challenges of minority and medically underserved populations.\nSpecifically, we will (1) enhance research efficiency, productivity, and impact by facilitating collaboration and\nproviding the logistical, communications, and operational support necessary to run a multicenter research\nConsortium; (2) facilitate the development of evidence-based symptom management recommendations by\nestablishing processes for harmonized data collection, the use of common data elements, and the application\nof consistent procedures across studies and research sites; and (3) accelerate adoption of integrated systems\nfor monitoring and managing patient-reported symptoms by developing and applying analytic approaches to\nIMPACT pooled data and collaborating with RCs and other stakeholder to broadly disseminate findings. This\napplication has specific strengths that will enhance the scientific productivity of the Consortium: (1) Under the\nleadership of Dr. Barbara Kroner, the CC will foster collaboration within the IMPACT Consortium by uniting\ndiverse researchers around shared goals and harmonized studies to advance the research agenda. (2) RTI will\npromote effective communication by developing custom web-based tools for communications, document\nsharing, and online trainings; establishing and leading SC working groups in topics relevant to IMPACT (e.g.,\nHealth Disparities; Implementation Science; Data Management, Statistics, and Informatics). (3) RTI will use a\ncommon implementation framework (i.e., Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance\n(RE-AIM)) combined with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research) to concurrently evaluate\nmultilevel factors that can influence clinical practice by assessing both effectiveness and implementation\noutcomes. (4) RTI will leverage data standards and harmonization across the Consortium to catalyze data\nsharing and aggregation. (5) RTI will advocate for a Stakeholder Advisory Group to guide and inform pooled\nstudy design, data collection, analyses, and interpretation of study findings. (6) RTI will combine the\nharmonized data with planned pooled analyses which will yield optimal management system models for\nimplementing integrated systems into routine clinical practice and use implementation science approaches to\naccelerate adoption of integrated systems and sustain changes in clinical practice.

Development of the Cellular\nImmunotherapy Data Resource (CIDR) will leverage the CIBMTR infrastructure for database development,\ndata sharing, networking with participating centers, and clinical research in cellular therapy for the treatment of\ncancer. Additionally, innovative approaches to optimize capture of long-term follow-up data from recipients of\ngenetically modified cells will be explored, such as utilization of electronic patient-reported outcome tools.\nProviding access to high quality data for research is among the main goals of the CIDR. The proposed project\nemploys a variety of methods to promote use of the resource, including access to prepared datasets, reports\nand publications, rapid response to requests for custom datasets, and a system to evaluate and prioritize\nrequests for statistical support. The latter will be provided by statisticians with deep expertise in survival\nanalysis. Finally, collaboration with multiple stakeholders, including professional societies, accreditation bodies,\nindustry, treating centers, and investigators representing multiple areas of oncology, hematology, cell\nprocessing, and immunology will optimize utilization of the CIDR resource and advance the rapidly emerging\nfield of cellular immunotherapy.

As the CC, RTI will provide scientific expertise and logistical support to create a cohesive research\ngroup that will develop the evidence base to increase CRC screening, diagnosis, and referral-to-care among\npopulations who currently have low rates of screening. Specifically, we will (1) enhance productivity of\nACCSIS Program members and stakeholders by providing necessary logistical, communications, and\noperational support; (2) support the generation of the evidence base on multilevel interventions to increase\nCRC screening by establishing common data elements and harmonized data collection procedures across\nresearch projects; (3) identify and support locally-developed innovative approaches to accelerate the\nevaluation of additional promising interventions to increase CRC screening; and (4) generate a user-friendly\ndata repository and disseminate program findings to facilitate the adaption and scale-up of successful\ninterventions. RTI has specific strengths that will enhance the scientific productivity of the program, including\nthe following six. (1) We will use previously tested procedures and policies, based on our experience as the\nCC for more than 35 multisite projects, to enhance coordination among ACCSIS studies. (2) Our team, led\nby Dr. Sujha Subramanian, has more than a decade of experience in CRC screening studies, and will be\nsupported by a multidisciplinary team of experts in implementation science, heath systems and community\nclinical linkages, heath disparities, multisite data collection, biostatistics, ethics and health data regulations,\nweb design, data repository management, and dissemination. (3) We will enhance existing frameworks for\ncommon data collection that we have developed through our partnership with more than 40 CRC\nimplementation programs by expanding the frameworks to include moderators and mediators. Expansion will\nallow us to understand the underlying pathways at each level of the intervention (patient, provider, and\norganization or community). (4) We will draw upon our ready-built network of CRC stakeholders to\nincorporate lessons learned from prior implementation studies and to identify locally-developed innovative\napproaches. (5) We will leverage internal expertise in implementation science methods and conduct mixed\nanalysis using both quantitative and qualitative data to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cross-\nsite findings from the multilevel interventions. (6) We will combine our leadership in communication science\nmethods with our award-winning multimedia team to deliver an evidence-based branding strategy and\ndissemination plan to increase the visibility and reach of the ACCSIS Program.

Cancer genomics has\ncontributed to many advances in treating several cancers, but the field is limited by a lack of genomics data. The\nParticipant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network will promote and support\nresearch on direct participant engagement approaches to address these gaps, especially among rare cancers,\nhighly lethal cancers, cancers with an early age of onset, cancers with high disparities in incidence/mortality, and\ncancers among under-represented minorities.\n Our team wishes to contribute to the important work of the (PE-CGS) Network by serving as its\ncoordinating center. We have the necessary faculty, resources, and experience to address the needs and\ngoals of the Network by supporting network coordination, promoting effective and equitable outreach and\npromotion, and establishing and disseminating network best practices. In addition to meeting all the requirements\nof the RFA, we bring innovation by establishing Participant Engagement Community (PEC) by applying the\nprinciples of community-based participatory research and by promoting a diverse pool of future scientists,\nespecially those from underrepresented groups through a Summer Scholar Program and by two post-doctoral\npositions that will be supported by our comprehensive cancer center.\n Our proposal for the coordinating center is focused around four specific aims. First, we will effectively\nmanage administrative and scientific coordination of the PE-CGS network. This will include providing\nadministration/coordination, governing all advisory, organizing meetings/site visits, fostering collaboration,\ndissemination and implementation, and coordinating communication. Second, we will foster effective and\nculturally appropriate outreach and promotion activities. We will establish a common branded, public relations,\ncommunication resources, facilitating interactions, and managing outreach. Third, we will develop and\ndisseminate network best practices and data collection/processing standards. We provide support for participant\nengagement and cancer genome sequencing activities, establish data standards, ensure data are accessible to\nthe public, data are appropriately shared, and support efforts to make the Network sustainable. Finally, we want\nto address health disparities and promote equity throughout the Network and ensure there is a diverse pool of\nfuture scientists, including those from underrepresented groups, to support future efforts in participant\nengagement and cancer genomics. We envision that the network will need to evolve to address emerging issues\nin participant engagement and believe that being based in a university setting will provide us the capacity to\nanticipate and address these issues as they emerge. We are strongly supported by the OSU College of Medicine,\nthe OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the OSU Center for Clinical and Translational Science.

project	1U2CCA233195-01	U2CCA233195	9626781	2018	The Cellular Geography of Therapeutic Resistance in Cancer	Grant	Most patients who die from cancer do so because their cancer is resistant to available therapies, either\nintrinsically, or as it evolves in response to treatment. However, the fundamental mechanisms driving resistance\nremain largely unknown. Tumors are comprised of a complex multicellular ecosystem of malignant and non-\nmalignant cells, and changes in their composition, states, spatial organization and interactions are central to\ntherapeutic resistance. Thus, there is an enormous need to chart an atlas of a tumor's cells, their spatial\norganization and interactions as those change dynamically in resistance to therapy. Technological\nbreakthroughs in spatial and single-cell genomics, including many innovations by our team, now put an atlas\nwithin reach, but harnessing this remarkable opportunity, requires collection of multiple spatial and single cell\ngenomics data in clinical samples; novel study design strategies; new experimental and computational strategies\nto integrate across cellular and spatial data; algorithms to construct tumor atlases that capture the resistant state;\nand showing how to use an atlas to formulate and test new predictive models of resistance. The Boston Human\nTumor Atlas Network Research Center (HTA-RC) will address each of these challenges by creating three\ncomprehensive atlases of the cellular geography of human cancer to understand how changes in the\ntumor ecosystem lead to therapeutic resistance in: (1) Primary and acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition\nin breast cancer; (2) Primary and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic melanoma;\nand (3) Primary resistance to immunotherapy in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinoma (CRC)\ncompared with microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC. All three tumors types tackle an unmet clinical need; have an\napproximately equal rate of resistance and response to allow comparisons between states; and harness\nsignificant clinical experience and build on substantial preliminary results at our center. To construct the atlases,\nwe will collect at least 100 biospecimens per year from resections and biopsies of the three tumor types and\nanalyze them with histopathological data, high-resolution spatial multiplex RNA and protein data, single-\ncell genomics data, and temporal clinical data. Our algorithms will recover key features of each data modality,\nand integrate them into a single atlas to determine what predicts and underlies resistance. We build on a\nwell-established interdisciplinary team in two major cancer centers (DFCI, MGH) and four research\ninstitutions (Broad, Harvard, Stanford, Princeton). Our leadership (Haining, Regev) and Units comprise of\nforemost experts and pioneers in clinical genomics (Biospecimens; Johnson, Wagle), spatial and single cell\ngenomics (Shalek, Rozenblatt-Rosen, Nolan, Zhuang), and computational biology and data science (Regev,\nVan Allen, Engelhardt). Our atlases will allow identification of predictive biomarkers of resistance in the tumor\necosystem, and therapeutic target discovery, targeting diverse facets of the complex tumor ecosystem.

project	1U2CCA233238-01	U2CCA233238	9627274	2018	The Lung PCA: A Multi-Dimensional Atlas of Pulmonary Premalignancy	Grant	Abstract:\nLung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide chiefly due to our inability to detect the\ndisease at its earliest stage and the lack of interventions to prevent its development in those at highest risk.\nThe rate-limiting step to developing new approaches for lung cancer detection and prevention is our lack of\nunderstanding of the earliest molecular and cellular changes associated with lung carcinogenesis. We propose\nto develop a high-resolution, multidimensional genetic, molecular, and cellular atlas of pre-cancerous lung\nlesions and their surrounding microenvironment for lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, the\ntwo most common subtypes of lung cancer. We will leverage unique retrospective and prospective cohorts\nassembled at multiple medical centers via our Biospecimen Unit to collect, annotate, and process premalignant\nlesion biospecimens of the lung and airway. Our Characterization Unit will apply existing and emerging\nmolecular profiling tools to characterize the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic landscape of these lesions.\nPipelines for standardized multidimensional data processing, quality control, analysis and integration will be\ndeveloped by our Data Analysis Unit, leading to creation of a web-based portal for data dissemination and\nonline integrative analysis to benefit the greater research community. Cross-sectional sampling of\npremalignant squamous and adenomatous lesions adjacent to early stage cancer will enable development of a\nspatial map that will provide insights into the evolution of premalignant cells and their microenvironment. Our\nlongitudinal study of airway premalignant squamous lesions that progress toward or regress away from\ninvasive carcinoma will provide both a temporal and spatial map of the molecular determinants of invasive\ncarcinoma. We will also leverage this longitudinal study to demonstrate the clinical utility of our Lung Pre-\nCancer Atlas through development of prognostic biomarkers of premalignant progression that can be applied\nclinically for precision management, as well as to stratify patients with aggressive premalignant squamous\nlesions into early-phase intervention trials. Successful completion of the Atlas will be accelerated by: (1) a\nhighly-coordinated Administrative Core that will facilitate interactions within and across Units, as well as the\nexchange of data, methods, and tools with other centers within the HTAN; and (2) partnerships with ongoing\nNCI, foundation, and industry lung premalignancy initiatives. Our Lung Pre-Cancer Atlas will ultimately serve\nas a resource for the medical and scientific communities to enable the development of biomarkers for early\ndetection and risk stratification, as well as identification of novel targets for therapies that will intercept the\ndevelopment of lung cancer.

project	1U2CCA233254-01	U2CCA233254	9627374	2018	Breast Pre-Cancer Atlas Center	Grant	ABSTRACT – Overall\nDevelopment of invasive breast cancer may frequently progress through a preinvasive precursor called ductal\ncarcinoma in situ (DCIS). DCIS is an extremely common clinical diagnosis that is essentially a disease of\nscreening triggered by the detection of abnormal breast calcifications on mammography. Before the advent of\nmammography, DCIS was an incidental and relatively uncommon finding. Over 60,000 women in the United\nStates will be presented with this diagnosis each year with relatively weak evidence-based guidance for\ndisease management which ranges from active surveillance to bilateral mastectomy. We propose to compile\nmulti-dimensional and multi-scale information on DCIS to construct a Pre-Cancer Atlas that can be used to\nbetter understand the disease but also to better stratify risk of progression, a useful translational endpoint. To\ndo this, we have assembled a team of investigators with deep and complementary clinical, experimental, and\nquantitative expertise and experience with DCIS and breast cancer in general. Further, we conduct these\nstudies with full consideration of tumor evolution and ecology as it pertains to precancer development and\nprogression. Specific aspects of the proposed Atlas construction include: 1) Several types of DCIS cohorts that\nwill capture spatial and longitudinal information including a prospective clinical trial cohort undergoing active\nsurveillance, 2) Analyses designed to maintain relevant spatial organization of the disease for evolutionary and\nAtlas building considerations based on 3) Radiologic-histologic-cellular-molecular registration approaches, 4)\nCharacterization at multiple scales including whole tumor, single duct and single cell levels, 5) Characterization\nof relevant parameters including mutations, copy number changes, methylation, gene expression, and\nmicroenvironmental elements including inflammatory cell profiles. 6) Incorporation of the breast cancer intrinsic\nsubtype paradigm into the analytic phase, and 7) Layered, spatial, and longitudinal data visualization. Overall,\nthis work will provide a comprehensive platform to guide the next generation of studies on DCIS and other\nprecancers.

project	1U2CCA233262-01	U2CCA233262	9627416	2018	Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center)	Grant	SUMMARY-ABSTRACT\n The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre-\nmalignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre-\nmelanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to\nmyeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as\nshaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the\nCenter for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary\ntechnical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision\nprevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the\nmolecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk\nindividuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials.\nThis will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex\ntissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.\n Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination\nwith HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with\nthree subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists\nand a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological\nspecimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository\nwill provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in\nprospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an\noncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high-\nplex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic\nimmunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate\nreagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications.\nAim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to\nmanage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most\ntechnically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each\nin preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm\ndevelopment. The resulting human browsable and machine-readable atlases are expected to yield new\nscientific discoveries, demonstrate the feasibility and utility of new technologies and help to reduce the\nincidence of life-threatening cancers of the skin and blood.

project	1U2CCA233280-01	U2CCA233280	9627504	2018	Omic and Multidimensional Spatial Atlas of Metastatic Breast and Prostate Cancers	Grant	ABSTRACT - Overall\nWe propose to create an Omic and Multidimensional Spatial (OMS) Atlas that will enable discovery of\nmechanisms of resistance that arise in individual patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancer during\ntreatment with current generation targeted therapeutic combinations and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The\nOMS Atlas is motivated by the fact that these treatments typically are only transiently effective in the metastatic\nsetting. Possible resistance mechanisms may be intrinsic to the tumor cells or derive from the diverse\nmicroenvironments in which the tumor cells live. The OMS Atlas will focus on elucidating these resistance\nmechanisms in three specific current generation clinical scenarios: (a) hormone-receptor positive breast cancer\n(HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, (b) triple negative\nbreast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and (c)\ncastration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) undergoing treatment with enzalutamide. We will accomplish this\nthrough work in four areas. A Biospecimen Unit will prospectively collect, manage, and distribute longitudinal\nclinical information, blood, and biopsies from 20 patients from each of two metastatic breast cancer cohorts and\none prostate cancer cohort that will be analyzed to create three OMS Atlases. The biopsies will be preserved to\nenable analyses using multiple characterization modalities. A Characterization Unit will analyze (a) OCT frozen\nspecimens using Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) and Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing ATAC-\nseq (sci-ATAC-seq) to elucidate spatially defined genomic changes and chromatin accessibility in single cells,\n(b) formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to\nassess the immune microenvironment and cyclic Immunofluorescence (cycIF) to assess the composition and\nmolecular states of tumor cells and their microenvironments, and (c) paraformaldehyde fixed, resin embedded\n(PFRE) specimens using a Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM) to identify\nultrastructural changes in 2D images and targeted 3D images with 4-nm resolution. Omic characterization of the\nsame tumor samples will be provided by the SMMART Program. A Data Analysis Unit will develop and deploy\ntools to (a) manage, analyze, and visualize Tier 1 data comprised of raw sequence data and images to generate\nunimodal Tier 2 results, (b) integrate omics and imaging data through crosswise mapping to create single\ntimepoint tumor maps and quantify systems biological functions of tumor cellular subpopulations to generate Tier\n3 results, and (c) explore differences between pre- and on/post-treatment tumor maps to reveal mechanisms of\nresistance that comprise Tier 4 results. We will collaborate with private sector partners to evaluate and adopt\nnext generation technologies that increase analytical power and speed and reduce costs. The Administrative\nUnit will facilitate the coordination, operation, interaction, and evaluation of activities within the OMS Atlas and\nbetween OMS Atlas scientists and the HTAN.

Spread of\ncancer cells beyond the primary tumor site is the cause of the majority of cancer deaths and the most\novert expression of cancer's complex evolutionary dynamics. Intimately related to the intricate\nprocesses of development and immunity, the transition from locally invasive to metastatic cancer poses\na major scientific hurdle. Recent technological and computational advancements, pioneered by our\nteam enable dynamic, multi-dimensional, multi-planar analysis of multiple tissues. Applying these\nadvances to the most lethal cancers in the US: Lung Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer and CNS metastases,\nwe will generate a Human Tissue Atlas with unprecedented spatial-temporal resolution. This\nmultidisciplinary effort begins with an unparalleled array of human tissues and clinical data acquired by\nour Biospecimen Unit team. These high-quality biospecimens will be obtained from lung cancer,\npancreatic cancer and CNS metastases obtained from surgical resections, biopsy or autopsy. The Data\nAnalysis Unit will then subject these specimens will be subjected to multi-dimensional analysis including\nbulk DNA sequencing, single cell and single nuclear RNA sequencing, as well as architecturally-\nsensitive analyses including MIBI (protein) and MERFISH (RNA) technologies. Driven by revolutionary\ncomputational and systems biologists, integration and presentation of these datasets will be undertaken\nby the Characterization Unit, with the goal of generating authoritative human tumor atlases of value to\nthe entire cancer research community.

project	1U2CCA233285-01	U2CCA233285	9627531	2018	Center for pediatric tumor cell atlas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL\nChildhood Cancer is the second most common causes of childhood deaths. Cancers in children are highly\ndistinct from those in adults. Causes, mechanisms and therapeutic approaches cannot be extrapolated from\nthe study of adult malignancies. To impact the burden of pediatric cancers requires the specific study of\npediatric cancers. We therefore propose the in depth characterization of three specific subtypes of pediatric\nmalignancies which, together, account for over 50% of all pediatric cancer deaths: high grade glioma (pHGG),\nhigh risk neuroblastoma (NB), and very high risk acute lymphoblastic B-cell precursor leukemia (VHR-ALL). All\nthree tumor types share a characteristic of typically initial response to therapy, followed by the emergence of\nresistance and refractory disease. We will map molecular and cellular changes in tumor cells,\nmicroenvironment and the immune system using comprehensive multi-dimensional single-cell and in situ\ntechnologies associated with two critical transitions: initial response, and emergence of resistant disease –\nboth high-priority transitions. Treatment modalities will include standard chemotherapy, molecular targeted\ntherapies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-) T cell therapy, capturing the cutting edge of current cancer\ntherapy. The final product will impact global childhood cancer research in the following manner: 1) Tumor\nAtlases: atlases will provide a highly user friendly, publicly available, searchable database of the most\ncomprehensive multi-omic, single cell analysis of the three most lethal childhood cancers. Molecular data will\nbe richly annotated with access to additional pathological evaluation, clinical and outcomes data, and grant\naccess to source data such tumor imaging. 2) Computational methods: in addition to the data, the critical\ncomputational tools and pipelines used in this project will be available to the research community. These\ninclude methods and pipelines for processing multi-omics and in situ data, inference of cancer phylogeny,\ninference of cell- and clone-specific pathways, methods for inferring cell-cell crosstalk, as well as database\nalgorithms for the query, exploration and visualization of highly complex data. 3) Access to biospecimens for\nfollow up studies: biospecimens collected in this project will be banked and made available to the biomedical\nresearch community. These include tissue sections, viably frozen specimen, and patient derived xenograft\n(PDX models). In summary, the proposed project will seek to address a major public health need in pediatrics,\nbroadly impact the entire research community, and jumpstart target discovery based on a sophisticated\nunderstanding of the key molecular circuits that drive pediatric cancer.

project	1U2CCA233291-01	U2CCA233291	9627573	2018	Integrative Single-Cell Atlas of Host and Microenvironment in Colorectal Neoplastic Transformation	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top three most prevalent cancers in\nglobal incidence and mortality. Most of these cancers develop from pre-cancerous adenomas. Colonoscopy is\ncurrently the most effective CRC prevention strategy. However, colonoscopy may fail to prevent carcinoma in\nas many as 24% of cases, is less effective at preventing proximal CRCs, is expensive for health care systems\nto implement, carries economic and psychosocial burdens for patients, and can be complicated by bleeding,\nperforation, and other adverse events. There is an unmet need to develop new preventive strategies and risk\nstratification models to address these and other issues. By analysis of whole human tissue, seminal work from\nBert Vogelstein and co-workers demonstrated that CRC develops from an accumulation of genetic events as\ntumors evolve from small to large adenomas and, eventually, to cancers. More recently, our group reported the\nfirst comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of CRC, which also was from a bulk analysis of whole\ntissue Despite this wealth of data on CRC, we believe that the ability to provide the most effective precision\ndiagnostics and preventive strategies can only be achieved with single-cell analysis. Through such a single-cell\nanalysis, we propose to map spatial relationships across the spectrum of normal colon, early polyps, and late\nadenomas, including their unique stromal and microbial microenvironments. Aim 1: To construct a pre-cancer\natlas of colorectal adenoma progression that depicts the spatial landscape of the tumor ecosystem, including\nthe stroma and biofilm-associated microbiome, using single-cell (sc)RNA-seq, whole exome sequencing,\nmultiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), and species-specific bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\nAim 2: To integrate the activities and data from the Biospecimen, Tissue Characterization and Data Analysis\nUnits for the prospective standardized collection and analysis of colorectal tissue, associated biospecimens,\nand related clinical and epidemiological data from 1,800 participants undergoing colonoscopy or surgical\nresection. Aim 3: To disseminate the pre-cancer atlas, related biospecimens, primary data sets and analytical\ntools to the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), the broader scientific community, and the lay public. To\naccomplish these aims, we have assembled a highly interactive and established team of investigators with\ncomplementary expertise (epidemiologists, gastroenterologists, pathologists, surgeons, systems biologists,\nbioinformaticians, cancer biologists, immunologists, and biofilms/infectious disease experts). To further\noptimize our novel methodologies for application to the prospectively collected samples from 1,800 atlas\nparticipants, we will leverage our existing large repository of colorectal adenomas and supporting\nbiospecimens, generated and curated through an ongoing epidemiological project through 3 cycles of the\nVanderbilt GI Special Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE). We are confident that our application, in\ntoto, is greater than the sum of its parts, and we look forward to robust bi-directional interactions with HTAN.

project	1U2CCA233303-01	U2CCA233303	9627644	2018	Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract: Overall\nDiverse areas of cancer research have progressed to the point that it is now feasible to meaningfully integrate\nresearch data and clinical information across the molecular, cellular, and tissue realms into a larger, more\ndetailed picture of the onco-dynamics of cancer, including spatial-temporal details during cancer treatment and\nprogression. Physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the\nSiteman Cancer Center (WUSM-SCC) are longtime leaders in the allied sub-disciplines of cancer, including\ngenomics, proteomics, imaging, functional characterization, pathology, clinical trials, and clinical care. WUSM-\nSCC is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, which sees ~9,000 new cancer patients annually.\nBuilding on our expertise, established infrastructure, large patient population, and extraordinary institutional\ncommitment, we propose to develop the Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center (WU-\nHTARC) within the NIH Human Tumor Analysis Network (HTAN).\nWe will focus on generating organ-specific human tumor atlases for three high priority cancer types associated\nwith exceptionally poor prognosis: the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), glioblastoma (GBM), and\npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Collectively, we will analyze ~1,600-2000 samples collected from\nspatially separated locations and at different time points along the clinical treatment course from 300-375\npatients (selected from ~750 recruited patients) for the duration of the project. In addition to standard\nhistopathological analyses, bulk DNA/RNA sequencing, proteomics, and clinical imaging, etc., we will conduct\ncutting-edge, comprehensive analyses, including single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), multiplexed\nimmunofluorescent protein localization (MxIF), mass cytometry/Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF) cellular\ncharacterization, metabolomics analysis, innovative imaging, and 3-D modeling.\nWe have established infrastructure covering the aforementioned areas, from specimen procurement\n(Biospecimen Unit), to multidisciplinary analyses modules (Characterization Unit), and to analysis pipelines\n(Data Analysis Unit). Data generated from this study will be valuable for revealing the clonal evolution of the\ntumor cells from longitudinally collected specimens and to reconstruct the tumor ecosystem involving non-\ncancer cells and acellular structures. Our atlases will have comprehensive data integration at the 3D level over\ntime, providing unprecedented 4D models for the 3 selected cancer types. Our established infrastructure and\ncontinuous efforts in incorporating new technologies in omics, imaging, and informatics, will help ensure our\natlases will be the state-of-the-art, taking full advantage of the latest progress in these fields and will continue\nto evolve beyond the pilot phase to facilitate cancer research and improve clinical care.\nThe proposed atlases target a set of critically important clinical questions, including tumor resistance that has\nlong been a challenge for GBM treatment and also an important clinical problem in BRCA/TNBC and PDAC, in\nwhich minority populations are disproportionately affected. Other emphases are BRCA response/resistance to\nchemotherapy, PDAC metastasis, and GBM local recurrence in conjunction with resistance to therapy. These\natlases can cross reference each other for pan-cancer analyses. We will also seek to cooperate with any Pre-\nCancer Atlas (PCA) centers studying these disease types to maximize the temporal continuity of research on\nthese cancers. The similarities and differences among the three selected cancer types will provide synergy\namong the three atlases and will also allow us to accumulate valuable knowledge in atlas building for other\ncancer types. The data, specimens, and experience gained by our center will be shared with HTAN and the\nbroader research community to foster the next important discoveries in personalized cancer medicine.	3-Dimensional;Affect;Anatomy;Archives;Area;Atlases;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;Cancer Biology;Cancer Center;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cataloging;Catalogs;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Clonal Evolution;Clonality;Collaborations;Communities;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Cytometry;DNA;Data;Data Analyses;Data Set;Dimensions;Discipline;Disease;Drug resistance;Ecosystem;Ensure;Evolution;FAIR principles;Fostering;Foundations;Future;Generations;Genes;Genome;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Goals;Histopathology;Human;Image;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Individual;Institutes;Knowledge;Link;Location;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medicine;Methodology;Minority;Modeling;Molecular;Mutate;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organ;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathology;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Physicians;Pilot Projects;Population;Positron-Emission Tomography;Process;Proteins;Proteome;Proteomics;Recurrence;Reporting;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resistance;Sampling;Series;Site;Slice;Solid Neoplasm;Spatial Distribution;Specimen;Structure;Time;Tissues;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Validation;Washington;anticancer research;biomarker discovery;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell type;chemotherapy;clinical application;clinical care;clinical imaging;cohesion;data integration;density;drug development;exome sequencing;experience;genome sequencing;imaging informatics;improved;in vivo;innovation;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;malignant breast neoplasm;medical schools;metabolome;metabolomics;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;new technology;new therapeutic target;outcome forecast;patient population;relational database;response;single-cell RNA sequencing;synergism;therapeutic development;therapy resistant;three dimensional structure;tool;transcriptome sequencing;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor progression;whole genome	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	SAINT LOUIS	MO	UNITED STATES	Samuel  Achilefu,Li  Ding,Ryan C Fields,William E.

project	1U2CCA233311-01	U2CCA233311	9627723	2018	Precancer Atlas of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis	Grant	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third highest cause of cancer death in the United States. Almost 80% of\nsporadic colorectal cancers have an APC gene mutation. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a hereditary\ncolon cancer syndrome, is also caused by mutations in APC and affects children as young as 7 years of age.\nFAP causes hundreds of colonic polyps in affected individuals and a 100% lifetime risk of CRC. In preliminary\nefforts we have successfully collected hundreds of pre-cancerous colon polyps from individual FAP patients,\napplied genomic, epigenomic and other multi-omic analyses and begun to elucidate the impact of multiple\ntypes of “omic” alterations on precancerous colon polyp evolution toward CRC. We propose to use an\nintegrated and collaborative approach to develop a PreCancer Atlas for colorectal adenocarcinoma using FAP\nas the disease model. We will:\n1) Establish a biospecimen collection pipeline for procurement of longitudinal tissue samples during\nsurveillance colonoscopy and during prophylactic surgical colectomy, including whole blood, serum, normal\ncolonic tissue, colon microbiome, benign pre-cancerous polyps, dysplastic precancerous polyps and colon\nadenocarcinomas. The material will be used for our own center and will also be available to the Human Tumor\nAtlas Network (HTAN). Medical records, longitudinal samples and all relevant metadata will also be collected.\n2) Establish a center to characterize the tissue samples with state-of-the-art omics and imaging technologies.\nThese include but are not limited to whole genome sequencing, methylation, transcriptome, proteome,\ncytokine, metabolome, microbiome, and molecular imaging.\n3) Establish an analysis core that analyzes and integrates results from -omics, imaging and medical\ninformation, builds a spatiotemporal, multidimensional, integrative multi-omics cancer atlas, and develops\nlongitudinal and predictive models for PreCancer biology and progression, as well as data portal and\nvisualization framework.\n4) Establish multi-omics technologies on smaller number of samples.\n5) Perform a “multiscale deep data analysis” on a large number of samples (57) from a few people and a fewer\nnumber of samples (6) from many people. Use this information to guide additional data collection.\n6) Identify factors (e.g. germline genetics, microbiome, immune dysfunction) contributing to polyp\nheterogeneity between and across individuals. Build disease progression models based on these data.\n7) Make all biospecimens, information, protocols and software available to the PCA, HTAN and the general\nscientific community.\nWe expect our efforts will greatly facilitate understanding CRC at its earliest stages and serve as a model for\nunderstanding precancerous lesions of other solid tumor malignancies.	7 year old;APC gene;Adenocarcinoma;Adenomatous Polyposis Coli;Affect;Atlases;Automobile Driving;Benign;Biological Models;Biology;Cancer Etiology;Cause of Death;Cessation of life;Child;Colectomy;Collection;Colon Adenocarcinoma;Colon Carcinoma;Colonic Polyps;Colonoscopy;Colorectal Adenocarcinoma;Colorectal Cancer;Colorectal Polyp;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease model;Epigenetic Process;Event;Evolution;Family;Gene Mutation;Genetic;Genomics;Health;Heterogeneity;Human;Image;Imaging technology;Immune System Diseases;Individual;Inherited;Integration Host Factors;Lead;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical;Medical Records;Metabolic;Metadata;Methylation;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Normal tissue morphology;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Pilot Projects;Polyps;Precancerous Polyp;Premalignant;Prevention strategy;Proteome;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Research Personnel;Sampling;Serum;Solid Neoplasm;Syndrome;System;Technology;Therapeutic;Tissue Sample;Tissues;United States;Whole Blood;base;collaborative approach;colon microbiome;colorectal cancer risk;cytokine;data portal;data visualization;epigenomics;experience;genome sequencing;lifetime risk;metabolome;microbiome;molecular imaging;multiple omics;novel;novel strategies;predictive modeling;prophylactic;spatiotemporal;transcriptome;treatment strategy;tumor;whole genome	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	STANFORD	CA	UNITED STATES	JAMES M.

project	1U2CCA252971-01A1	U2CCA252971	10294884	2021	USC PE-GCS: Optimizing Engagement of Hispanic Colorectal Cancer Patients in Cancer Genomic Characterization Studies	Grant	ABSTRACT\nColorectal Cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. Hispanic/Latinos are the largest\nand fasting growing ethnic group in the US, and cancer is the leading cause of death among H/L in the US.\nTherefore, we need to fully understand the full complexity of the molecular etiology of cancer in this ethnic group.\nFor instance, although incidence rates of CRC are lower among Latinos as compared to Whites or African\nAmericans, Hispanics with metastatic disease have shorter overall survival when adjusted for health care setting,\ndemographics, disease characteristics and treatment factors. H/L also tend to be diagnosed at a younger age\nand with higher stage, and we have previously reported that Mexican H/L in California have the greatest\nproportion of young (<50 years of age) diagnoses compared to other H/L subgroups. Moreover, Mexican H/L\nshowed higher prevalence of rectal cancer cases compared to other H/L and NHW. Although socio-economics\nand access to care might influence these differences, we need to take a complete look at the biology of disease\nin this ethnic group to determine once and for all if these clinical differences are related to differences in molecular\netiology. The Cancer Genome Atlas has provided a deep overview of the molecular taxonomy of CRC in 594\ncases, however, less than 1% of the cases (n=5) were H/L. Therefore, it is imperative for us to take more detailed\nassessment of the molecular genomic landscape of CRC in H/L. One of the major issues likely limiting our ability\nto perform these large genomic initiatives in minority patients is that Patient or Participant Engagement practices\nmay not been investigated to identify best practices for accruing and consenting patients into clinical translational\nbiomedical research studies. This concept of Participant Engagement is critically important for both the patients\nand the translational cancer research community. Optimizing and improving our approaches for directly\nengaging patients at initial contact, throughout the course of a translational genomic study, and during the time\nof return of results is likely to lead to stronger relationships between the medical community and patients, but\ncould also lead to significant improvement in outcomes for patients and for the cancer care community as a\nwhole. As such, we propose the creation of the USC Center for Optimization of Participant Engagement in\nCancer Characterization (COPECC) with a focus on optimizing the engagement of Latinos in CRC Genomic\nCharacterization research studies. USC COPECC would serve as a member of the NCI U2C Participant\nEngagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network. Our investigative team includes experts in\nall relevant areas of research for genomic characterization, participant engagement, and engagement\noptimization. We have an established platform for consenting patients into cancer genomics studies that will\nserve as a standard process. The overall goal of USC COPECC is to generate results on participant engagement\noptimization and CRC genomic research that will be shared with the broader community to distribute best\npractices for engaging Latinos in hopes of improving overall outcomes for CRC in this underserved population.

project	1U2CCA252973-01	U2CCA252973	10048641	2020	Engagement of American Indians of Southwestern Tribal Nations in Cancer Genome Sequencing	Grant	While American Indian (AI) Tribes and communities are highly diverse in ethnicity, language, and culture, there\nis one unfortunate characteristic that they share: profound cancer health disparities. Compounded by\ndisproportionately low rates of cancer screening and more limited access to healthcare, AI are more often\ndiagnosed at later stages of disease and have the poorest outcomes in all types of cancer when compared to\nany other racial and ethnic group in the United States. The cause of these significant cancer health disparities is\nundoubtedly multifactorial. However, an unexplored factor is the molecular characterization of tumors arising in\nAI. American Indians and Alaska Natives (AN) have been strikingly understudied in The Cancer Genome Atlas\nProject (TCGA) and account for only < 0.5% of the cancer patients studied. Of the nearly 11,000 patients\nsequenced in TCGA to date, only 27 (0.25%) were identified as AI/AN. It is our hypothesis that through\nappropriate participant and community engagement and comprehensive genomic sequencing, we will discover\nnovel somatic and germline mutations, differences in the spectrum and/or frequency of cancer-promoting\nmutations, and genome-wide mutational signatures reflective of behaviors and exposures, that can ultimately be\ntranslated to improved cancer screening, precision prevention, and therapeutic intervention in American Indian\nparticipants and communities. In this application, we will focus on the molecular characterization of cancers\nwhich show significant disparities in AI of the Southwest, including gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary cancers\n(stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, liver, gallbladder and biliary tree); genitourinary cancers (kidney, prostate\ncancer); and other hormone-dependent cancers (breast, ovarian cancers). Our Specific Aims are to develop\nculturally-appropriate, respectful, and trusted means to: 1) Engage American Indian participants (cancer patients\nand survivors) and their Tribal communities in participatory research studies of the molecular characterization of\ncancer, particularly focusing on cancers that display striking disparities in incidence and outcome in Southwest\nTribal Nations; 2) Discover novel somatic and germline mutations and/or differences in the spectrum and\nfrequency of cancer-promoting mutations, and genome-wide mutational signatures reflective of specific\nbehaviors and exposures, in American Indian participants, relative to other racial and ethnic populations in the\nU.S. and the world; 3) Disseminate knowledge gained through these studies to Tribal participants and Tribal\nCouncils, leaders, stakeholders, and communities using unique means of participant engagement and novel\nmeans of communication, such as visual arts and media, that are sensitive to cultural and religious beliefs and\npractices and that acknowledge the indigenous languages and dialects, many of which lack many scientific and\nmedical terms for words and concepts such as cancer, gene, genomics, mutation, and DNA, and 4) (Share\nknowledge with the broader scientific community through the NCI Genome Data Commons and publication of\nscientific results in accordance with NIH Data Sharing Policies and Tribal Agreements.

project	1U2CCA252974-01	U2CCA252974	10048560	2020	Count Me In: Partnering with patients to define the clinical and genomic landscape of rare aggressive sarcomas in children and adults	Grant	Osteosarcoma (OS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) are exceedingly rare cancers, both subtypes of sarcoma,\nthat arise in bone and smooth muscle respectively. There has been a failure to improve survival rates or decrease\ntreatment-related morbidity in OS/LMS due to insufficient characterization of the genomic landscape, resulting\nin a lack of targeted therapeutic approaches, diagnostic methods, and preventive strategies. There is an urgent\nneed for a large, shared database of clinical and genomic data in OS and LMS. Yet, because of the rarity of\nthese tumor types as well as other challenges in patient recruitment and the genomic characterization of these\ntumors, to date it has been difficult to generate this data. The overarching goal of this proposal is to engage\nadult and pediatric participants with OS and LMS as partners to generate a shared database of clinical,\ngenomic, molecular, and patient-reported data. This should accelerate discoveries that drive novel treatment\nstrategies, new clinical trials, and new standards of care. The Count Me In PE-CGS U2C Research Center will\nleverage our experience in patient engagement, genome characterization, computational analysis, and\nbehavioral research to create and launch two patient-partnered projects to generate this clinicogenomic\ndata. We will build two websites with patients in the OS and LMS communities—the Osteosarcoma Project\n(OSproject) and the Leiomyosarcoma Project (LMSproject)—and consent 3,000 patients over the course of the\nstudy. We will collect medical records, patient-reported data, archival tumor tissue samples, and saliva and blood\nfor genomic analysis. We will generate clinically annotated genomic data from at least 750 tumor specimens,\n500 circulating tumor DNA specimens, and corresponding germline specimens and share the de-identified data\nwidely. At the same time, we will study and optimize the approach to patient engagement in cancer research,\nparticularly among rural and minority participants and participants across a range of literacy levels, ages, and\nstages in development. To accomplish these goals, we will build on a well-established interdisciplinary team from\nthe Broad Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with members who have pioneered these approaches. Our\nleadership (Wagle, Janeway) and Units are comprised of experts in patient-partnered cancer research (Wagle,\nPainter), sarcoma clinical and translational research (Janeway, George, Crompton, Raut), genome\ncharacterization, analysis, and clinical interpretation (Gabriel, Getz, Van Allen, Wagle, Janeway),\ncomputational biology/data science (Getz, Van Allen, Philippakis), and behavioral science (Mack, Rebbeck).\nOur Center will uncover the key clinicogenomic features of OS/LMS, integrate them into a single comprehensive\ndatabase with a goal of accelerating research and improving the lives of these patients. In doing so, we also\naim to present a general approach to patient-partnered research that can be disseminated broadly and applied\nto other tumors types and patient communities.

The optimal clinical management for LGG remains unknown. A\ncomprehensive genomic characterization of the evolution from primary LGG to recurrence is required\nto begin to address the LGG knowledge gap; optimizing the engagement of LGG patients in this effort\nis critical to the success of this process. Using our International Low Grade Glioma Registry as a starting\npoint, we will construct a community of 700 LGG patients who have undergone surgical resection at time of\ndiagnosis and at time of recurrence and want to participate in research. We will use both hospital-based as\nwell as web- and social media-based patient engagement efforts and adapt pre-existing resources developed\nat Yale including HUGO PHR, a secure cloud-based personal health record platform that allows secure and\npermission-based movement of data bi-directionally between patients and researchers and ARCHETYP, a\nYale-developed software that assists patients in the location of clinical trials. We hypothesize that LGG\npatient engagement and satisfaction (and thus overall participation) in genomic characterization\nstudies will be improved by 1) the ability to obtain and share medical record data with researchers, 2)\nthe availability of bi-directional communication between study and patients regarding study focus,\nprogress, outcomes as well as patient specific results, 3) improved messaging and education\nregarding study and patient goals with respect to genomic characterization of patient materials. We\nalso propose that the knowledge gained in this application will provide a significant improvement in\nthe care of LGG patients.

project	1U2CCA252981-01A1	U2CCA252981	10294012	2021	Washington University Participant Engagement and Cancer Genomic Sequencing Center (WU-PE-CGS)	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nVision. Participant engagement and sequencing research from the Washington University Participant\nEngagement and Cancer Genomic Sequencing Center (WU-PE-CGS) will fill critical gaps in knowledge,\nmethodology, and characterization of understudied cancer populations, leading to optimal approaches to\nparticipant engagement, outreach, and communication in genomic characterization studies.\nGoal. The overall goal of the WU-PE-CGS is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for approaches direct\nengagement of cancer patients and post-treatment cancer survivors as participants in cancer research. Our\nfocus is on rare and understudied cancer populations with significant disparities including cholangiocarcinoma,\nmultiple myeloma, and colorectal cancer under age 50. Participant engagement strategies are most effective\nwhen they are adapted and implemented in real-world settings in partnership with community and patient\nadvocacy stakeholders.\nSetting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration,\ncatalyzes new ideas in patient engagement, and ensures support for patient engagement and genome\nsequencing that finds solutions for complex recruitment and engagement challenges in real-world settings with\nunderrepresented patient populations. Significant matching contributions from Washington University will allow\nus to quickly and strategically invest in ideas.\nAims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) Advance the field of participant engagement to study cancer\ndisparities and rare cancers by conducting innovative and impactful direct stakeholder engagement with\ncontinuous evaluation and research; (2) Expand an exceptional, diverse team of investigators, patients, and\nadvocacy stakeholders; (3) Address cancer disparities by understanding barriers to and improving the ability\nfor disadvantaged and understudied populations to encounter, use, and benefit from genomic sequencing and\nanalysis; (4) Organize and integrate Center units to facilitate transdisciplinary, team science within our Center\nand across the PE-CGS Network.\nInnovations and impact. The WU-PE-CGS builds on a long and outstanding record of leadership in both cancer\ndisparities and genomic research across the cancer continuum. We will be particularly innovative and allow for\na significant return on the scientific investment in several ways. First, our Center has distinctive features that\ninclude a combined focus on cancer disparities, the application of strategies to increase participant\nengagement in research, success in biospecimen acquisition, and exceptional genomic sequencing expertise.\nSecond, we have assembled a diverse, world class team with strong linkages to multiple rare and understudied\ncancers. Third, we engage investigators from different disciplines and invest in the development of early\ncareer scholars. Fourth, we will strategically and creatively disseminate products in ways that will benefit\nresearchers, practitioners, and community members. Fifth, we will partner with exceptional patient-centered\nand wide-reaching advocacy groups to engage patients, optimize recruitment, and seamlessly return results.\nInput from these groups, patients, and their families is a key strength that will leverage our track record of\nstakeholder-engaged research. And finally, we have developed a focused strategy for collective integration of\nour units.

project	1U54CA209978-01A1	U54CA209978	9350520	2017	Combating Subclonal Evolution of Resistant Cancer Phenotypes	Grant	Overall abstract\nOur Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution) will develop\na suite of\nsystems-based methodologies to understand how genomic diversity, clonal evolution, and phenotypic change\n . To evaluate their potential for\ntranslation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these\nphenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from\nselection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and\nmodeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets.\nSelective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's\ntumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and\nphenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it\nis not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and\nhow they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other\nquestions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the\nchanges and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using\nour unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will\ntest in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes.\nOur Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in\naddition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of\nthe evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad\nmultisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical\ntargeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor\nheterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our\nmultidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical\nbiologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next\ngeneration of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and\ntheir impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient\nsamples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell\npopulation dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a\nknowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients.\ninteract in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer	Address;Behavior;Biological Models;Biological Pharmacology;Biological Process;Breast;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Clonal Evolution;Clonality;Collection;Communities;Community Outreach;Complex;DNA;Data;Development;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;Education and Outreach;Educational Activities;Evolution;Faculty;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Heterogeneity;Individual;Institutes;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mathematics;Measures;Methodology;Modeling;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Ovarian;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Pharmacology Study;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Population Dynamics;Population Heterogeneity;Postdoctoral Fellow;Prevention program;Refractory;Regimen;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Science;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid;Somatic Mutation;System;Systems Analysis;Systems Biology;Testing;Therapeutic;Translations;Variant;base;cancer cell;cohort;combat;computerized tools;data sharing;dynamic system;effective therapy;experimental study;improved;innovation;knowledge base;malignant breast neoplasm;member;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel drug combination;outreach program;personalized cancer therapy;predictive modeling;pressure;prevent;programs;student training;synergism;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tool;transcriptomics;treatment response;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment	UNIVERSITY OF UTAH	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	UNITED STATES	ANDREA Hope BILD	DCB	Shannon K Hughes	474644	$250k to $499k	474644	9-May-2017	15-May-2017	30-Sep-2017	RFA-CA-15-014	Moonshot
project	1U54CA224018-01	U54CA224018	9444850	2017	Overcoming Drug Resistance in Multiple Myeloma	Grant	OVERALL ABSTRACT\nMM is a plasma cell neoplasm within the bone marrow with significant complexity and\nheterogeneity at the molecular level. Despite improvements in the clinical outcomes\nachieved with newer therapies, wide inter-individual variation in response to treatment is\na major limitation in achieving consistent therapeutic effects, or cures. Not all patients\nrespond to initial therapies (innate resistance), and those that do frequently relapse with\nrefractory disease (acquired resistance). The central hypothesis we are addressing is\nthat rational therapeutic development in MM should be based on an understanding of the\nunderlying genetics and biology of the tumor that identify sensitivity and resistance to\ncurrent and future drugs. In this Myeloma-DRSC we are proposing 3 Projects that will:\n1) develop a high throughput drug screening platform for myeloma cell lines representing\nthe wide diversity of MM biology; and use this platform to screen primary patient tumor\ncells for most effective responses, including combination therapies; 2) develop a\ncomprehensive mutational and germline variation panel that will be correlated to drug\nresponses in vitro and in vivo, as well as toxicities; 3) identify the mechanism of\nresponse and resistance for two of the most common therapeutics used in MM\ntreatment: IMiDS and proteasome inhibitors; 4) develop genetic and immunophenotypic\nsignatures that effectively predict tumor response, resistance, and patient toxicities; 5)\nidentify tumor sub-populations that may contribute to emerging resistance; and 6)\nidentify strategies to predict drug resistance and approaches to overcome resistance.

Treatment strategies for AML have not changed in 30-40 years. Single-agent\ntargeted therapies based on AML genetics or microenvironmental disease features have been disappointing, at\nbest. The investigators on this DRSC Program, Drug Combinations to Circumvent Resistance (D2CR), have\ncollaborated for over a decade and have developed functional genomic pipelines for evaluation of primary AML\npatient samples that have collectively led to numerous discoveries with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.\nFor this Program, our long-term goals are to translate effective drug combinations that target tumor-\nintrinsic and microenvironmental pathways into the clinic for patients with AML. Our immediate goals\nare to prioritize the most relevant tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways for each AML\ndisease subset and establish sufficient preclinical data to facilitate immediate clinical investigation of\ndrug combinations. Based on the central hypothesis that drug combinations targeting tumor intrinsic\nand extrinsic features of AML biology will be essential to the development of more effective and\ndurable therapeutic strategies, we predict that the drug combinations established by this D2CR-DRSC\nProgram will substantially improve outcomes for patients with AML. To accomplish these goals, 3\nProjects are proposed: 1) What are the tumor-intrinsic genes and pathways that contribute to drug sensitivity\nand resistance? Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screens on parental and drug-resistant AML cells will be\nintegrated with computational analysis of the largest functional genomic AML cohort in the world. The result will\nnominate genes/pathways for validation on patient samples in gene-edited models and for drug combination\nstudies in Project 3. 2) What are the tumor-extrinsic pathways promoting tumor cell growth, drug resistance,\nand immune suppression? Inflammatory cytokine profiling of our large bank of AML patient samples will be\nconducted. Our bank of AML patient bone marrow stromal cells will also be accessed for studies of the reactive\nsignature of these stromal cells when exposed to specific drugs. Finally, high-parameter immunophenotyping\nand T-cell functional assays will be used to define the immune landscape with candidate drugs tested in an\nimmune-competent, spontaneous mouse model of AML. Candidate targets will be nominated for combination\nstudies with tumor-intrinsic targets. 3) What are the drug combinations that most effectively bridge tumor-\nintrinsic and microenvironmental biology to eliminate AML cells and circumvent resistance? Drug combinations\nfrom targets nominated in Project 1 and 2 will be tested ex vivo on primary AML patient samples and in vivo\nusing AML patient-derived xenografts. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a major\nimpact on our understanding of AML biology, with successful clinical translation of new, more effective drug\ncombination strategies.

project	1U54CA224065-01	U54CA224065	9446059	2017	University of Texas PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	SUMMARY\nOur overarching goal for the University Texas PDX Development and Trial Center (UTPDTC) is to optimize\npersonalized biomarker-based cancer therapy and identify effective targeted drugs based on the molecular\ncharacteristics of each tumor. Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly-\nannotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The\nprimary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single\nagents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs\nor combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets\nof tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused\non non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative\nbreast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other\nhistologies. Over the past 9 years, both University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDACC) and The University of\nUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) have established institution-wide efforts to generate\nnovel PDX models and perform preclinical testing. Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX\nmodels of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC,\nn=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases\nwhere there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We have characterized many tumor subtypes in our existing\nPDXs and plan to characterize many more with the ultimate goal of developing drug combinations in defined\ntumor subsets in a context that can lead to clinical trials which will validate the experimental results. We plan to\nfocus on NCI-IND agents that are primarily used by the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network. The\navailability of hundreds of PDXs of diverse histologic types and molecular profiles provides a unique opportunity\nfor synergistic interactions among the UTPDTC investigators, PDXNet, and ETCTN. Each Project will identify\nmolecular subtypes and then test with drugs targeted to putative pathways. Similar molecular subtype profiles\nwill be identified across projects and histologic classifications. This provides an opportunity to test the activity of\ndrugs targeting specific molecular pathways that may be active in several histologically distinct subtypes. Such\npan-histologic activity could greatly accelerate drug development. Our proposed studies focus on targeted\ntherapeutic agents for treatment of diseases and/or molecular subtypes that have unmet medical needs. The\nproposed studies are highly relevant to public health, as their success will lead to effective precision therapy for\ncancers, for which current therapies are ineffective.

project	1U54CA224068-01	U54CA224068	9446211	2017	An integrated translational approach to overcome drug resistance	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL)\nDrug resistance represents one of the most critical obstacles to clinical benefit for cancer patients. Due to the\nsize and complexity of this challenge, we believe a collaborative team approach is critical and have assembled\na team of drug resistance experts from three leading institutions (MGH, the Broad Institute, and MIT/Koch\nInstitute) with an exceptional track record of impactful discoveries in this field. We propose an integrated full-\nspectrum translational platform—including liquid biopsy, patient-derived tumor models, exome and\ntranscriptome sequencing of tumor tissue, rapid autopsy, functional genomic screens, innovative preclinical\nmouse models, and a high-throughput combination drug-screening platform covering the CTEP portfolio—to\naddress critical principles of drug resistance across several major cancer types—lung, melanoma and GI\ncancers, which impact a large percentage of cancer patients. Overall, these three projects will focus on the\ncommon theme of bypass resistance mechanisms, a critical ad frequent mechanism of therapeutic resistance\nthat can involve both genetic and adaptive resistance mechanisms that “bypass” the effects of therapy, and\nwhich can drive both intrinsic and acquired resistance. To maximize the potential impact on cancer patients we\nwill focus projects on three major tumor types—lung, melanoma and GI cancers—with each project integrating\nat least two tumor types. We will focus our projects on defining and overcoming key bypass resistance\nmechanisms to three of the most critical classes of cancer therapeutics: MAPK inhibitors, RTK inhibitors, and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors. While each project will focus on a specific therapy and at least two specific\ncancer types, we believe the overall program design can be readily applied to additional agents and\nmolecularly-defined cancers, such that the ultimate impact of this work will go beyond the specific studies\nproposed and will serve as a “blueprint” for critical discoveries related to drug resistance. We anticipate that\nthese efforts will define a new standard in our mechanistic understanding of bypass resistance mechanisms\nand will lead to novel opportunities to overcome them in the clinic. Our proposed approach will provide a\nsteady stream of novel therapeutic strategies involving CTEP agents and pathways for evaluation in future\nclinical trials, as well as new potential agents for the CTEP portfolio. We have also integrated cutting-edge\nstrategies for real-time blood-based monitoring of response and resistance to help guide innovative trial\ndesign.

project	1U54CA224070-01	U54CA224070	9446221	2017	Rational approaches to melanoma therapy	Grant	Project Summary – Overall\nThe outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma have improved dramatically over the last decade due to an\nimproved understanding of the molecular drivers of this disease. In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens\nhave been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas.\nThese treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof-\nof-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will\nprogress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been\nshown to be effective in patients with a wild-type BRAF. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments\nthat prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are\neffective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies,\nover the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical,\nhistological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of >450 PDX models represents one of the\nlargest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately\nrecapituluates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also\nincludes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been\nmaintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a\nrobust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we\npropose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued\nexpansion of our robutst melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical\ngaps in this disease. Project 1 will characterize kinase inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the\nPI3K-AKT pathway in combination with approved targeted therapies in PDX models in treatment-naïve and drug-\nresistant BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanomas. Project 2 will characterize targeting the apoptotic machinery of cancer\ncells as a combinatorial approach with MAPK pathway inhibitors in PDX with and without BRAFV600E/K mutations,\nincluding in subsets with aberrancies in anti-apoptotic genes. Both Projects will utilize baseline characteristics of the\nPDX models to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to guide personalized patient selection for\nfuture clinical testing. In addition, tumors will be analyzed for treatment-induced effects that correlate with sensitivity\nto identified resistance mechanisms and potential new combinatorial strategies. Finally, markers identified in the\npreclinical models will be compared to parallel biomarker studies of metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in\nclinical trials utilizing the same agents. These studies will be supported by the PDX, Bioinformatics, and\nAdministrative Cores to ensure their success, along with a Pilot Project program to open new areas of investigation.\nTogether these studies will have high potential to translate into new personalized clinical trials for patients.\n1	Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Area;BRAF gene;Bioinformatics;Biologic Characteristic;Biological Markers;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program;Cell Line;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collection;Cutaneous Melanoma;DNA;DNA Damage;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Drug resistance;Enrollment;Ensure;FDA approved;Fine needle aspiration biopsy;Foundations;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Heterogeneity;Heterogeneity;Histologic;Human;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immunodeficient Mouse;Immunotherapeutic agent;Institution;Investigation;Laboratories;Lesion;MAP Kinase Gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Melanoma Cell;Metastatic Melanoma;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Patient Selection;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Pilot Projects;Pre-Clinical Model;Property;Proteins;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;RNA;Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases;Regimen;Relapse;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Resources;Selection for Treatments;Signal Transduction;Solid;Specimen;Subgroup;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Translating;Tumor stage;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;cancer cell;combinatorial;disease heterogeneity;effective therapy;established cell line;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;kinase inhibitor;melanoma;multidisciplinary;mutant;novel drug combination;novel marker;novel therapeutic intervention;patient subsets;personalized medicine;personalized therapeutic;potential biomarker;prevent;programs;research clinical testing;resistance mechanism;response;success;targeted treatment;tool;tumor;tumor progression	WISTAR INSTITUTE	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	Michael  Davies,Meenhard F Herlyn	DCTD	Jeffrey Arnold Moscow	2885586	>=$1M	2885586	25-Sep-2017	30-Sep-2017	31-Aug-2019	RFA-CA-17-003	Moonshot

Toward this goal, our PDTC focuses on testing drugs that are already available through the NCI\nas NCI-IND agents with the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). Scientifically,\nthis PDTC will focus on preclinical evaluation of approved and investigational drugs and drug\ncombinations in a large collection of breast PDX models representing primary and metastatic breast\ncancer. One project will screen 35 NCI-IND drugs as single agents and in combination with standard-\nof-care therapies, in >100 breast PDX models using a novel organoid system, and validate these\nresponses in PDX-bearing mice. Another project will test therapies that are predicted to target tumor-\ninitiating cell populations, with the goal of reducing chemotherapy resistance and recurrence – the major\ncause of death from breast cancer. These two synergistic research projects will be supported several\nkey Cores: a PDX Core to propagate the PDX models and run the drug studies; a Biostatistics and\nBioinformatics Core to identify molecular features of tumors that do (or do not) respond to various\ntreatments; a Pilot Projects and Trans-network Activities Core to foster exploration of new ideas within\nthe PDTC and in collaboration with the PDXNetwork (PDXNet); and an Administrative Core to facilitate\neffective communication within the PDTC and with the PDXNet. Taken together, these elements will\nconverge to reveal high-priority treatment strategies for future clinical trials in breast cancer patients.

project	1U54CA224079-01	U54CA224079	9446574	2017	The MSKCC-UW/Fred Hutch Prostate Cancer Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center	Grant	OVERALL ABSTRACT\nThe lethal stage of metastatic prostate cancer, called castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), kills\n~26,000 men per year in the US. Despite remarkable improvements in survival with next generation AR\npathway inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, CRPC patients ultimately progress and die from\ntheir disease. Our understanding of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to AR therapy has increased\ndramatically in recent years, largely based on genomic landscape analyses of tumors from CRPC patients and\npreclinical studies of acquired resistance in patient-derived models (organoids, PDX). Much of this progress is\ndirectly linked to the members of this Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center (DRSC) team. A major\nmechanistic insight from these studies is the recognition of two categories of AR therapy resistance: one in\nwhich AR pathway signaling is restored and the other in which it remains inhibited. Underlying both categories\nare a heterogeneous set of resistance mechanisms, many of which were discovered by our DRSC team\nmembers. Importantly, we have shown that several of these resistance mechanisms can be targeted with\ncurrent clinical grade drugs. The overarching goal of this DRSC proposal is to evaluate these translational\nopportunities across a unique set of preclinical organoid and PDX models (again, discovered and developed by\nour DRSC team members) and to catalyze the initiation of clinical studies in patients most likely to benefit\nbased on appropriate biomarker profiles. We address this goal in three Projects. Project 1 focuses on\nresistance caused by restored AR pathway function, which occurs in over ~50% of CRPC patients, by targeting\nthe glucocorticoid receptor, which is upregulated and substitutes for AR, or by further inhibition of AR signaling\nusing drugs targeting specific components of the chromatin machinery. Project 2 will take a similar approach\nbut will focus on the opposite category of acquired resistance (absence of restored AR pathway activity),\nleveraging insights from our recent data showing that cancer can revert from an AR-negative to AR-positive\nstate by targeting specific chromatin modifiers. Project 3 integrates with Projects 1 and 2 by focusing on\nkinase inhibitors as an adjunct to AR pathway therapy in two distinct contexts – PI3K/AKT activation in tumors\nwith PTEN loss and FGFR activation in tumors with autocrine FGF8/FGF9 production. Excitingly, a recent\nclinical trial of combined AKT and AR inhibition, which was initiated based on our earlier work, demonstrated a\nsignificant improvement in survival for patients with PTEN loss prostate cancer. The Administrative Core will\noversee the integration of the Projects with each other, with NCI scientific staff and with other DRSCs.\nCollectively our studies will validate various combination therapy regimens, in conjunction with molecular\nbiomarkers for patient selection, as a critical step toward clinical translation. In addition, the drugs and targets\nstudied here are broadly relevant for multiple cancer types.

project	1U54CA224081-01	U54CA224081	9446620	2017	Bay Area Team Against Resistance	Grant	PROJECT ABSTRACT\nThe proposed Bay Area Team Against Resistance U54 Project (BATAR-UP) is an interdisciplinary effort of\ninvestigators to apply their knowledge and expertise to dissect the molecular and cellular basis of incomplete\nresponse and resistance to current treatments and to identify new treatment strategies to better neutralize or\neliminate residual disease and prevent resistance. This translational approach will be part of the NCI's Drug\nResistance and Sensitivity Centers Network to develop innovative strategies to understand and combat\nmechanisms of tumor resistance and exploit tumor sensitivity to anti-cancer therapies.\n To accomplish this, BATAR-UP will support two projects and one core driven by a multidisciplinary\nteam of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University. Project 1 will define and interrogate the molecular and\ncellular basis of residual disease in lung cancers treated with targeted inhibitors in clinical use. We will prioritize\nfor initial study both EGFR-mutant and ALK gene rearrangement positive lung cancers, given their importance\nas key molecular disease subtypes and our prior published work and expertise. We will harness genetic and\ntranscriptomic analysis of clinical samples (liquid and tumor biopsies) to provide a molecular view of the\nevolution of response, residual disease, and acquired resistance. We will generate organoid and PDX models\nand apply cutting-edge functional screens (genetic, pharmacologic, and targeted proteomic assays) to identify\nkey vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited, including with CTEP agents. This systematic\napproach will allow us to reveal the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that drives EGFR\nand ALK inhibitor resistance and pinpoint therapeutic strategies to intercept the evolution of residual disease\nand eventual acquired resistance. Project 2 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of\nresistance and residual disease in lung cancers treated with current immunotherapies, including PD-1 and PD-\nL1 antibodies. Leveraging shared platforms in synergy with Project 1, we will perform systematic analyses of\nliquid and tumor biopsy specimens (and ex vivo models) obtained from patients longitudinally before and\nduring treatment and upon acquired resistance. We will focus our studies on EGFR and ALK wild type patients,\nincluding squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma patients where immunotherapy has shown efficacy\nbut is typically non-curative. We will leverage (1) a novel lung cancer organoid model wherein tumor biopsies\nare cultured as both tumor epithelium and their endogenous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) en bloc as a\ncohesive unit, and (2) deep droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Our systematic approach will help\ndefine the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that contributes to immunotherapy resistance\nand identify potential new therapeutic strategies to help convert these incomplete responses into curative\noutcomes. Our Administrative Core will provide leadership, coordination and oversight for BATAR-UP with\nthe overarching goal of synergizing the research conducted in the 2 Projects and the entire DRSC network.

project	1U54CA224083-01	U54CA224083	9446705	2017	Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract: Overall\nWith the discovery of a number of new molecular targets and exponential increase in the number of anti-cancer\nagents, it has become imperative to optimize preclinical models in order to design rational clinical trials.\nRecognizing the unique advantage of the patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) models in drug testing and\npersonalized medicine, physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and\nthe Siteman Cancer Center have been actively generating and utilizing PDX models for cancer research and\nthe evaluation of molecularly targeted agents. Building on our strength and existing infrastructure, we propose\nto establish the Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center (WU-PDTC), as part of PDXNet\nprogram, to promote preclinical testing in a collaborative nation-wide effort.\nThe PDX core within WU-PDTC will develop and characterize at least 1000 new pathogen-free PDX models\nacross major tumor types. The PDX models will be genomically and phenotypically characterized using the\nlatest `omics technologies and expertly analyzed using the most current data analysis pipelines that have been\ndeployed for other large scale NCI programs. The Bioinformatics Core will integrate these analyzes with clinical\nannotation from the originating patient to include patient treatment history and tumor response (Aim 1). Our two\nresearch projects will conduct PDX clinical trials using single agent and combinational agents using drugs\nunder NCI-IND (Aim 2). Project 1 will test pan- or beta isoform specific class I PI3K inhibitors in over 100\nbreast PDX models while Project 2 will study combinatorial approaches that overcome tumor intrinsic and\nextrinsic mechanisms to ERK inhibition in over 100 already available pancreatic PDX models. Proteogenomic\nand clinical response data will be collected in these models, as part of a broader effort of characterizing PDX\nmodels and conducting clinical correlation and treatment response analyses by the Bioinformatics Core (Aim\n3). All relevant information, including proteogenomic features of PDX models and treatment/response history,\nwill be tracked in a dedicated relational database that will be accessible to PDXNet and PDMR-FNLCR. The\ngoal is to identify candidates for human clinical trials for the ET-CTN. In Aim 4, the WU-PDTC will leverage\nexisting expertise and programs from the NCI-designated Comprehensive Siteman Cancer Center, Institute of\nClinical and Translational Research (ITCS), McDonnell Genome Institute, Mallinkrodt Imaging Research\nCenter, and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN) to support the goals of developing and utilizing\nPDX models to test and improve cancer treatment, in collaboration with other components of the PDXNet.\nFinally, WU-PDTC, through coordination by the Administration Core, will support pilot research projects\nutilizing the PDX resources and fostering collaboration across PDTCs, PNMR-FNLCR, and other NCI\nprograms. The goal is to increase the spectrum of agents tested in PDX clinical trials and to improve the\nreliability, validation, utility, and standardization of PDX models through innovative Cross-PDXNet research.\nOur demonstrated capability in generating and utilizing PDX models, extensive existing infrastructure, and\nstrong institutional commitment set a solid foundation for a successful PDTC that will help achieve goals set by\nNCI in advancing the use of PDX models in preclinical testing.

project	1U54CA231630-01A1	U54CA231630	9833682	2019	Defining and targeting the molecular vulnerabilities of the PAX3-FOXO1 protein in rhabdomyosarcoma	Grant	ABSTRACT – Overall (revised)\nFusion-positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) remains one of the most fatal but least understood cancers of childhood. The driving oncoprotein in ARMS is the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein, a chimeric transcription factor that hijacks normal gene expression and chromatin state. Five-year survival for children with PAX3-FOXO1- positive ARMS is ~30% for all-comers, and <10% when metastatic. Despite the discovery of PAX3-FOXO1 in 1993, treatment strategies for affected children remain unchanged. This deficiency stems equally from a lack of understanding of the basic biology of the disease and an inability to directly target the fusion protein. No systematic or comprehensive approach has been undertaken to identify the proteins and regulatory elements required to support PAX3-FOXO1-mediated tumorigenesis. As a result, the field has been limited to a patchwork of data with no unified scientific strategy. To overcome this, this FusOnC2 Center has an innovative team and dynamic environment in which data interpretation is informed by complementary technological approaches and by biological and clinical knowledge. This comprehensive approach will transform understanding of PAX3-FOXO1-mediated oncogenesis and create opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The Center’s overarching goal is to advance the therapeutic tractability of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein in ARMS by comprehensively identifying the druggable co-regulators, modulators, and intrinsic activities of PAX3-FOXO1. To accomplish this goal, the Center includes two complementary Projects, each led by expert RMS biologists paired with specialists in pioneering experimental approaches undertaking the most cutting-edge research in cancer biology, genomics, proteomics, structural biology, and medicinal chemistry. The Projects will be supported by RMS investigators within each project who will provide curated RMS cell lines, unique human primary RMS tumor cells, and murine models to enable rapid in vitro and in vivo validation and cross-prioritization of targets. An Administrative Core will integrate and coordinate the Center components, providing leadership and oversight, and promoting cross-pollination of ideas and resources. The Overall Specific Aims are to: (1) define and target the PAX3-FOXO1 interactome; and (2) perform chemical probe discovery for PAX3-FOXO1 to create additional tools for investigating the fundamental biology and tractability of PAX3-FOXO1 and fusion-positive RMS. Approaches used include proximity labeling, saturation mutagenesis, single and combinatorial CRISPR screens, high-throughput phenotypic assays, and mechanistically unbiased approaches to chemical probe discovery using novel high-throughput binding assays. We will use information gleaned to prioritize targets and agents for validation and to inform compound optimization and PROTAC preparation. This Center’s strengths and resources will synergize with the FusOnC2 Consortium, speeding development of knowledge generalizable to the biology of multiple fusion oncoproteins in childhood cancers, accelerating advances in clinical care.

project	1U54CA231637-01	U54CA231637	9600132	2018	The Center for Therapeutic Targeting of EWS-oncoproteins	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall\nThe primary scientific focus of this Center is to understand the molecular underpinnings of EWS-ETS driven\nEwing sarcoma and to investigate novel treatments and therapeutic mechanisms to improve outcomes for\npediatric patients with this aggressive disease. Translation of molecular understanding of sarcoma\npathophysiology into effective new drugs in the clinic is a complex, risky proposition that requires the coordinated\nefforts of a talented team of individuals with complementary skills. This group brings expertise in Ewing sarcoma\nbiology and the EWS-ETS oncoproteins, epigenetics and transcription, structural biology, computational biology,\nchemical biology and drug development, mouse models, preclinical experimental therapeutics, and clinical trials\ndevelopment. A Center mechanism is essential to the success of this proposal. No one institution nor individual\ncan bring mastery of the diversity of approaches, technologies, and scientific domains needed to achieve the\ngoals of this proposal. We have elected to focus on understanding the fundamental inner workings of Ewing\nsarcoma from its transcriptional circuits, to the direct protein interactions with EWS-FLI1, to the direct and\nimmediate effects of EWS-FLI1 degradation. Moreover, a strong emphasis of this proposal is on target\nidentification and preclinical validation, critical steps in the process of bringing forward therapies with optimal\nchances for success in the clinic. The team that is assembled has all of the component pieces needed for\nsuccess. Our Center includes outstanding basic cancer biologists, chemists, computational biologists, and\ntranslational researchers, and five pediatric oncologists. Thus, the proposed Center can catalyze basic discovery\nand clinical translation by leveraging basic and clinical research talent within the Center and our strong ties to\noutside academic and industrial partners.

This Center’s mission is tightly aligned with that of the larger Consortium on Fusion Oncoproteins in Childhood Cancers and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative. A major impetus for the development of this Consortium has been the growing knowledge that fusion oncoproteins that are pathognomonic for specific cancer types often function via disruption of the structure and/or activity of protein complexes that govern chromatin architecture and hence gene control. We have shown that at least two of the fusion oncoproteins highlighted as major areas of emphasis within the Consortium, SS18-SSX and EWS-FLI1, bind and act via BAF complexes to drive cancer-specific oncogenic gene expression. Importantly, genetic studies across human cancer types have indicated that genes encoding encoding mSWI/SNF complex subunits are among the most frequently mutated, at over 20% of all human cancers, further underscoring the need for a detailed understanding of BAF complex structure, topology and mechanisms on chromatin. \nOur multi-institutional collaborative network seeks to comprehensively interrogate biologic mechanisms underpinning the function of the SS18-SSX oncogenic fusion protein in synovial sarcoma and to use the approaches and the results generated to launch targeted therapeutic discovery campaigns that are directly linked to the mechanisms identified. Specifically, our approach encompasses three major areas: (1) BAF complex genomic targeting, gene regulation, and chromatin state interactions, including interactions with other chromatin regulators; (2) Understanding the role of the wild-type SS18 protein, its protein-level regulation, and mechanisms by which its stabilization can reverse SS18-SSX-mediated BAF complex activity and be exploited for therapeutic benefit; (3) Mechanistically characterizing synovial sarcoma-specific vulnerabilities, centered in chromatin-bound protein complexes and related pathways. The highly integrative nature of the PI-directed research projects and expertise within collaborator laboratories provide the strongest possible likelihood that the aims will be successfully achieved and that novel therapeutic strategies will emerge from this Center.

project	1U54CA231641-01	U54CA231641	9600275	2018	An integrated approach to analyze and target EWS/FLI in Ewing sarcoma	Grant	Overall Section Summary/Abstract\nThe overarching goal of our FusOnC2 TEST (Targeting the Ewing Sarcoma Translocation) Center is to develop a new mechanistic understanding of EWS/FLI that will allow for the development of new therapeutic approaches for Ewing sarcoma based on inhibiting EWS/FLI.  EWS/FLI is an aberrant oncogenic transcription factor formed by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal translocation that is the driver oncoprotein of this tumor.  Multiple independent studies demonstrate a critical dependence of Ewing sarcoma cells on EWS/FLI such that blockade of the translocation is associated with a loss of proliferation, loss of cell cycle progression and ultimately reversal of oncogenic transformation.  Thus, most investigators believe that inhibition of EWS/FLI in the clinic would be the best way to treat patients with Ewing sarcoma.  \n\nTraditional chemical design of EWS/FLI inhibitors has proven challenging because the molecule does not contain traditionally “druggable” pockets.  We therefore hypothesize that a deeper scientific understanding of EWS/FLI transcriptional function in Ewing sarcoma will allow for identification of new agents.\n\nThe FusOnC2 TEST Center will focus on two critical molecular features of EWS/FLI required for its transcriptional and oncogenic function:  (i) binding of EWS/FLI to GGAA-microsatellites and related DNA response elements, and (ii) EWS/FLI self-association activities to form “hubs” that coordinate protein-interactions through low-complexity domains to mediate transcriptional function.\n\nTargeting EWS/FLI requires diverse expertise to be focused on this problem.  The TEST Center is designed to facilitate both independent and highly-focused studies on critical components of EWS/FLI function, while at the same time interacting with the entire FusOnC2 consortium to share new knowledge, techniques, and expertise that will help facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches to Ewing sarcoma.  We believe that the TEST Center will contribute greatly to the overall success of the FusOnC2 Consortium, and help to change the paradigm for how new therapies are developed for pediatric translocation-associated cancers.

project	1U54CA231649-01A1	U54CA231649	9834547	2019	Targeting EWSR1-FLI1 through Functional, Structural and Chemical Approaches	Grant	Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone and soft tissue malignancy in children and adolescents. The\nfive-year survival of Ewing sarcoma patients is 70%, and falls to less than 20% for those with metastatic\ndisease, a situation that has not improved despite many years of increasingly intensive chemotherapy\nregimens. Survivors of Ewing sarcoma often suffer long-term deleterious effects of treatment. An immediate\nneed exists for the development of effective, targeted therapies with decreased toxicity. Molecularly, Ewing\nsarcoma is characterized by one of several reciprocal chromosomal translocations that fuse a FET family\nprotein with an ETS transcription factor, the most common of which is EWSR1-FLI1. The EWSR1-FLI1 fusion\nprotein is completely specific to Ewing sarcoma tumor cells, and thus presents an ideal target for novel\ntherapeutics. To date, however, no such targeted therapy has become clinically available, owing to 4 major\nknowledge gaps. First, there is a dearth of robust in vitro model systems for functional studies of EWSR1-FLI1.\nKnockdown studies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines can give inconsistent results, and few primary cell types\ntolerate exogenous EWSR1-FLI1 expression. Second, the protein encoded by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion is a\ntranscription factor, and there is widespread perception that such proteins are “undruggable”. Third, lead\ncandidates of small-molecule screens reported to date have either not been shown to have a mechanistic link\nto EWSR1-FLI1, or fail to replicate the phenotype of Ewing sarcoma cells depleted of EWSR1-FLI1 activity.\nFourth, the field has lacked relevant animal models for functional genomics and preclinical testing. Developing\ntargeted therapy for Ewing sarcoma will require an integrated approach executed by an experienced team. Our\nstrategy is based on several fundamentals, namely 1) systems to specifically deplete and reconstitute the\nEWSR1-FLI1 protein in cells; 2) an understanding of the structural biochemistry of low-complexity (LC)\ndomains found in EWSR1 and related proteins; and 3) novel in vivo models of Ewing sarcoma for functional\ngenomics and drug testing. Standing on this foundation, we will perform biochemical and genetic experiments\nto identify the binding partners and functional effectors of EWSR1-FLI1 and dissect its mechanisms of\ntranscriptional activation. We will use our experimental systems to conduct phenotypic and target-based high-\nthroughput screens. Finally, we are well-positioned to perform the work required to transform a compound with\npromising initial activity into a preclinical drug lead. Our approach to drug discovery is built upon medicinal\nchemistry coupled with secondary assays that maximize potency and specificity of lead compounds.

Among the FusOnC2 consortium cancers of interest, synovial sarcoma has the highest incidence in\nthe United States and worldwide, but has been a specifically underserved malignancy due to its predilection for\nthe adolescent and young adult population and its relatively poor responsiveness to systemic therapy,\ncompared to other pediatric sarcomas that also associate with fusion oncogenes. While much of the biology of\nSS18-SSX remains unknown and synovial sarcoma patients represent a clearly underserved, orphan-disease\npopulation, there are two principles at the extremes of the cancer biology spectrum that are well established.\nFirst, SS18-SSX has proven the capacity to recapitulate synovial sarcomagenesis faithfully in the mouse\nwithout the need of introduced or stochastically acquired secondary genetic changes, second SS18-SSX has\nbiochemically demonstrated interactions with an important chromatin remodeling complex called SWI/SNF or\nBAF. This application proposes to build three research projects focused on the cell biology of transformation,\ngenome-wide chromatin biology and SWI/SNF (BAF) complex componentry biology, each related to SS18-\nSSX. These discovery biology and therapeutic target identification efforts will be supported by two shared\nresource cores that will provide human validation of therapeutic targets and preclinical testing of therapeutic\nstrategies. The group of investigators has developed as an organically assembled network of collaborations,\nbuilt over the last decade, during which time each project has gathered substantial preliminary data using a\nvariety of functional screens, a newly identified cell of origin, the ability to track SS18-SSX genome wide\nlocalization and protein interactions, a powerful system to produce and evaluate recombinant SWI/SNF (BAF)\ncomplexes with variable componentry, and powerful mouse genetic models of synovial sarcoma—including\nspontaneous development of metastatic disease. Preliminary data are sufficiently robust to recommend\ntherapeutic strategies immediately from each research project for the cores to validate and evaluate in clinically\nrelevant mouse models and quantitative molecular imaging.

To complement the funded U54 (Maris and Mackall, MPI) of the PI-DDN that largely\nseeks to harness adaptive immunity to further develop CAR-T cells against newly identified antigens, we propose\nto harness innate immunity to target pediatric cancers, to circumvent resistance to conventional therapy, and to\nfurther enable adaptive/hybrid immune approaches.\nOur aims are to (1) Identify and overcome barriers to utilizing NK and CAR-NK cells as cancer therapeutics, (2)\nbreak tolerance to “self” cancer-associated proteins and (3) enhance immunotherapies by targeting suppressive\nmyeloid cells. We will accomplish our aims through four projects, based at two major sites based in Ohio\n(Nationwide Children’s Hospital) and New York (New York Medical College) with subsites in Columbus (The\nOhio State University) and Minneapolis (Univeristy of Minnesota). In addition to an Administrative Shared\nResource (Core A, directed by Dr. Timothy Cripe and Associate Director Dr. Mitchell Cairo), the projects are\nscientifically supported by a comprehensive Genomics & Immune Monitoring Shared Resource (Core B, directed\nby Dr. Elaine Mardis with several subspecialy assistant directors). Core B provides integrated datasets via state-\nof-the-art technologies including mass cytometry, single cell transcriptomics, and an array of other genomics\napproaches that enable detailed characterizations and tracking of cancer cell immunogenicity, the tumor immune\nmicroenvironment, and immunologic responses. We have also assembled strong external and internal scientific\nadvisory boards of renowned leaders whose expertise spans the projects and shared resources. The projects\nare highly integrated and cross-informative. We propose that therapeutic regimens that combine modalities will\nproduce synergy that drives anti-tumor immune responses in preclinical pediatric cancer models, overcoming\nthe limitations of low mutational burdens. Our goal is to generate a sufficient body of knowledge with compelling\ndata to inform the rational design of future clinical trials and thereby improve the lives of children with cancer.\n1	Address;Adoptive Immunotherapy;Adoptive Transfer;Adult;Antigens;Binding;Biological;Cancer Burden;Cancer Model;Case Study;Cell surface;Cells;Childhood;Childhood Solid Neoplasm;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Combination immunotherapy;Complement;Cytometry;Data;Data Set;Development;Effectiveness;Funding;Future;Genomic approach;Genomics;Goals;Homing;Hybrids;Immune;Immune response;Immunologic Adjuvants;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Inflammatory;Innate Immune Response;Interruption;Knowledge;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Minnesota;Modality;Mutation;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Natural Immunity;Natural Killer Cells;New York;Normal Cell;Ohio;Oncolytic viruses;Patients;Pediatric Hospitals;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Physicians;Pre-Clinical Model;Proteins;Regimen;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resource Sharing;STAT3 gene;Scientist;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid Neoplasm;Source;T cell response;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Traction;Transforming Growth Factor beta;Tumor Immunity;Universities;Virotherapy;Virus;Virus Diseases;adaptive immunity;anti-tumor immune response;base;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapy;chemokine;chemoradiation;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;combinatorial;conventional therapy;cytokine;design;effective therapy;embryo/fetus antigen;experience;immunogenicity;immunotherapy clinical trials;improved;macrophage;medical schools;neoantigens;novel;oncolytic virotherapy;pre-clinical;resistance mechanism;response;small molecule;success;synergism;trafficking;transcriptomics;translational study;tumor;tumor microenvironment	RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP	COLUMBUS	OH	UNITED STATES	TIMOTHY P CRIPE,Elaine R Mardis	DCTD	Katarzyna  Bourcier	10242127	>=$1M	10242127	12-Sep-2019	12-Sep-2019	31-Aug-2024	RFA-CA-19-003	Moonshot
project	1U54CA232568-01	U54CA232568	9617113	2018	Discovery and Development of Optimal Immunotherapeutic Strategies for Childhood Cancers	Grant	OVERALL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\n There is a major paradox confronting the field of childhood cancer research. Several decades ago,\npioneering investigators focused on children with cancer led a revolution resulting in previously incurable\nmalignancies becoming curable. In contrast, over the last two decades, basic science has continued to\nadvance fundamental understanding of the oncogenesis of pediatric cancers, but cure rates for most pediatric\nmalignancies have plateaued, and the field has witnessed first-hand that current standard therapies often\nsaddle survivors with life threatening therapy-induced morbidities. It is sobering that for most children who\nsuffer relapse, few if any novel therapeutic options exist, and most patients receive the same type of therapy\nthat failed them in the first place. The funding opportunity arising out of the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot\ninitiative directly addresses this paradox by forming a Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery and Development\nNetwork (PI-DDN). Immunotherapy for B-ALL and neuroblastoma is now credentialed, with CD19 directed\nimmunotherapies showing unprecedented activity in highly refractory cases of lymphoid malignancies. The\nfield is now poised for a focused and sustained multi-disciplinary effort to extend these early successes, and\nrethink our approach to childhood cancer therapy in general. Here, we propose a pediatric immuno-oncology\nCenter entitled Discovery and Development of Optimal Immunotherapeutic Strategies for Childhood\nCancers. We envision this Center providing a central hub for the PI-DDN, creating additional opportunities for\nmulti-disciplinary research with the common goal of creating new cancer immunotherapies for children. This\nCenter embodies three highly integrated multi-institutional Projects supported by a single Administrative and\nStatistical Core. The overarching hypothesis to be tested here is that childhood cancers harbor lineage-specific\nmechanisms of oncogenesis and immune evasion that can be precisely and effectively targeted by rationally\ndesigned and developed immunotherapeutic regimens. Project 1 will discover lineage specific cell surface\nmolecules that have project-defined optimal attributes for synthetic immunotherapeutic based targeting, and\nuse this to create and credential new therapeutics based upon preclinical efficacy in high-risk childhood cancer\nmodels. Project 2 will focus on major mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance by developing approaches to\ncircumvent the fundamental issues of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity and T cell dysfunction due to both\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors. Project 3 will focus on a major difference between pediatric and many adult\nmalignancies, with pediatric cancers typically eliciting little adaptive immunity, and develop approaches to\nenhance adaptive immune responses against pediatric cancer-specific antigenic targets. The proposed Center\nwill discover and develop effective immunotherapeutic strategies that will be immediately translatable to the\nclinic, is designed to have a major direct impact on childhood cancer outcomes, and as part of the PI-DDN it\nwill catalyze research advances across the spectrum of high-risk pediatric malignancies.

In addition, these minority populations remain underrepresented in therapeutic clinical\ntrials. Our Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (M-PDTC) provides a unique\nopportunity to help address these racial/ethnic disparities. This Center is built on the scientific premise that,\nin addition to important socioeconomic factors, health disparities that burden racial/ethnic minorities in\nthe US are linked to poorly understood genetic and other intrinsic factors. We propose to leverage the\nhigh numbers of minority cancer patients at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in order to generate and\nutilize innovative PDX models of diverse racial/ethnic minority origin, which will assist the entire scientific\ncommunity delineate the molecular underpinnings of cancer of racial/ethnic minority origin. Houston is the most\ndiverse large US city, with ~20% of its residents being African American (AA) and ~40% Hispanic. BCM faculty\nare responsible for clinical care at two major teaching hospitals that serve large minority populations: Ben Taub\nHospital (BTH), a public hospital (91% of patients are minorities), and the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center\n(MEDVAMC), one of the largest VA Medical Centers in the US, which serves over 100,000 veterans in Southeast\nTexas (~30% are AA). Thus, there is a very large population of minority cancer patients available for potential\ntissue donations. BCM has a long track record of successfully enrolling minority patients in clinical trials.\nIn addition to our large AA patient population at BCM, 59% of patients at BTH are of Hispanic ethnicity. We have\nassembled a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional collaborative team, bringing together experts in PDX model\ngeneration, molecular biology and signaling pathways, animal drug treatment studies, pathology and clinical\nmanagement of prostate and breast cancer from BCM and MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). We are\nideally positioned to leverage the technical resources of our institutions and our high numbers of racial and ethnic\nminority cancer patients at BCM, in order to support the broader goals of the M-PDTC RFA, in particular to\nfacilitate biospecimen donations from these populations and increase the racial and ethnic diversity of the\nPDXNet repository in a wide spectrum of cancers, as well as to support the Specific Aims of our two research\nprojects in prostate and breast cancer. Few, if any, cancer centers have this combination of an outstanding\nresearch base, large numbers of African American, Hispanic and Asian cancer patients, and BCM’s robust track\nrecord of successfully enrolling minority patients from our catchment area (Houston) into clinical trials. Moreover,\nour two research projects will utilize whole exome sequencing (WES), global RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq),\nquantitative proteomic (qKiP) and metabolomic profiling and will conduct preclinical trials of promising NCI-IND\ndrugs to uncover novel, effective treatment strategies for prostate and breast cancer in minority populations.

We have established an accomplished\ntransdisciplinary research team with an outstanding infrastructure that includes a University of California-wide\ncentral IRB system called Reliance and strong preliminary data to support the proposed PDX and cancer\ndisparities research, thus allowing our results to be easily translated to clinical trials. UCaMP is comprised of\nfour University of California NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers: UC Davis Comprehensive\nCancer Center (UC Davis), UC Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCLA), UC Irvine Health\nChao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Irvine), and UC San Francisco Helen Diller Family\nComprehensive Cancer Center (UCSF). Our collective strengths include complementary expertise in PDX\ndevelopment and drug testing, cancer health disparities, and clinical trial development robustly supported by\ncores for PDX, Pilot Studies, Bioinformatics, and Administration. We will achieve our goal through two\nResearch Projects. Project 1 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Gastric and Liver\nTumors, specifically addresses cancer health disparities in gastric cancers (GC) and liver cancers (LC) that\ndisproportionately affect all racial/ethnic minorities especially in HLA and AANHPI populations. By\nunderstanding the genetic and response differences among HLA, AANHPI compared to NHWs, we could\nenhance the precision of therapeutic treatments, identify resistance-associated biomarkers, and study\nresistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Project 2 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX\nModels for Lung and Bladder Tumors focuses on treatment disparities between AA and NHW patients to\nidentify therapies targeting common genetic alterations (e.g. PI3K pathway) and to reveal targeted therapy\nresistance mechanisms for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and advanced bladder cancer (aBC).

project	1U54CA243124-01	U54CA243124	9834651	2019	Experimental and preclinical modeling of NUP98-rearranged acute leukemia	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY - Overview\nFusion oncoproteins (FO) arising from the rearrangement of Nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) to a diverse range of\npartner genes are a hallmark of multiple subtypes of high risk myeloid malignancies in children and adolescents,\nincluding acute erythroleukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Such leukemias are associated with poor\noutcome, and more effective therapies are required. The long-term goal of this Center for Experimental and\nPreclinical Modeling of NUP98 Leukemia is to determine the molecular role, and potential vulnerabilities, of\nNUP98-fusion oncoproteins in leukemia through the development and interrogation of human and mouse model\nsystems, and to develop and test novel therapeutic approaches. The Center has assembled a consortium of\ninvestigators with complementary expertise in genomic characterization, leukemia modeling, chromatin biology,\nstructural biology and preclinical modeling. The Center is led by Dr Charles Mullighan of St Jude Children’s\nResearch Hospital together with Project Co-Leaders Drs Scott Armstrong (Dana Farber Cancer Institute),\nTaosheng Chen (St Jude), Alex Kentsis (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute), Jeffery Klco (St Jude) and\nRichard Kriwacki (St Jude). These investigators will co-Lead four projects performing experimental modeling\n(Project 1), investigating chromatin biology (Project 2), phase separation (Project 3) and drug development\n(Project 4) that will address the following questions and unmet needs: (1) to define how NUP98 fusions drive\nleukemogenesis using complementary, integrative engineered models and proteomic, transcriptomic and\nepigenomic profiles; (2) to develop genetically faithful engineered mouse, human and xenograft models of\nNUP98 leukemia for mechanistic interrogation and preclinical modeling; (3) to define the macromolecular\nchromatin and protein complexes assembled by NUP98 FOs; (4) to define the role of phase separation in NUP98\nFO leukemogenesis; (5) to define the dependencies and vulnerabilities of NUP98-rearranged leukemic cells;\nand (6) to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for NUP98-rearranged leukemia. The Center is\nsupported by an Administrative Core A that with an External Advisory Board will oversee project progress\ninteraction and reporting, a Genome Editing Core B led by Dr David Chen (City of Hope) that provides expertise\nand support for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing scans and screens; and a Chemistry Core C led by Dr Zoran\nRankovic (St Jude) that supports chemical library screen and drug design and development. This highly\nintegrated, interactive and synergistic Center will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of\noncogenesis of the different classes of NUP98 FO, and new therapeutic modalities that will be validated in\npreclinical models and translated into human clinical trials. All data and resources will be made freely available\nby websites, data deposition, and establishment of resource and genomic data portals to the FusOnC2\nconsortium and broad scientific community.

The primary tumor is initiated and driven by a single alteration in the DNA: A deletion of ~400kb that results in a fusion gene between the heat shock co-chaperone DNAJB1 and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, PRKACA. If the tumor is limited to the liver, then surgery is the accepted therapy. However, if the tumor has metastasized, there is no accepted therapy. This project will determine how the fusion oncoprotein leads to pathogenesis and will develop therapeutics targeted to the fusion oncoprotein. Pathogenesis is being probed by examining what is different about the fusion oncoprotein that causes changes in the cell. Therapeutics will target the fusion oncoprotein through small molecules to block activity, or small molecules to send it to the proteasome, or small molecules for allosteric inhibition.

One of the most\npotent agents are engineered T cells programmed to recognize and kill tumor cells. Nonetheless, our ability to\nengineer T cells and other immune cells and program them to execute new functions remains relatively\nprimitive. Aside from CAR T cells for treatment of blood cancers, most engineered cell therapies are risky,\npotentially highly toxic, unreliable and often ineffective, especially those cell therapies that attempt to target\nsolid cancers. We hypothesize that to fulfil the promise of engineered immune cell therapies, we must first\ntransform cell engineering into a systematic and predictable process; one that uses reliable technology\nplatforms and principles. Our center will focus on developing a set of sophisticated immune engineering\nplatforms that address three major needs in next-generation cell therapies:\n1) Smart recognition of cancer – develop antigen-pattern recognition circuits that direct immune cells to\n optimally recognize solid tumors and discriminate against normal tissue crossreaction, guided by\n computational bioinformatic analysis of gene expression patterns.\n2) Overcoming the tumor microenvironment – develop multiple classes of cellular circuits that can\n overcome or locally remodel immune-suppressive tumor microenvironments to promote highly efficient\n therapeutic immune cell trafficking, proliferation, persistence, and tumor-killing activity\n3) User-control and safety – to increase control over and safety of these powerful engineered cells, we will\n develop a suite of ways to communicate with and control the activity of engineered immune cells in vivo,\n including nano/microparticles and small molecules.\nTo achieve these goals, we have assembled the UCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology, a tightly\nintegrated interdisciplinary team that encompasses synthetic biologists, immunologists, bio-informaticists,\ncontrol engineers, and materials scientists. The products of this center will include publicly available toolkits of\nparts and circuits for cell engineering, high-throughput platforms for rapid circuit assembly, new programmable\nnanomaterials for controlling immune cell behavior, searchable bioinformatic databases for optimization of\ntumor recognition, and computational frameworks for circuit design and for modeling/prototyping in vivo circuit\nfunction. These platforms will help to advance immune cell engineering to be far more reliable, predictable,\neffective and safe.

project	1U54CA244711-01	U54CA244711	9870707	2019	Engineering the Next Generation of T Cells	Grant	OVERALL SUMMARY\nThis U54 “Immuno-engineering to Improve Immunotherapy (i3) Center” was developed in response to\nRFA-CA-19-013. The purpose of this U54 is to employ immuno-engineering principles to design more\ndurable, accessible, and less toxic immunoprevention and immunotherapy strategies. A national priority\nset by the Cancer Moonshot initiative is to support studies incorporating next-generation genetic\nengineering, engineered biomaterials, nanotechnology, computational and mathematical modelling, or\nsystems biology approaches in the design, implementation and evaluation of next generation\nimmunotherapies focused on overcoming immunosuppressive barriers, targeting tumor cells for killing,\nand generating long-lasting anti-cancer immunological memory. The focus of our U54 entitled\n“Engineering the next generation of T cells” is on developing next-generation gene-editing or\nmodification of immune cells to improve persistence in vivo, control and manipulate the immune system\nto reduce oﬀ-target toxicities and enhance anti-tumor eﬀectiveness of adoptive cell therapy. Our central\nhypothesis is that next generation engineering can improve the safety and efficacy of CAR T cells\nwhile decreasing the cost of goods. There are three scientific projects in our U54 Center. The shared\ngoal of these projects is to enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with\nblood cancer and solid cancers. In Project 1, we are using CRISPR/Cas9 to edit the epigenome of T\ncells and to make cells resistant to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), while employing engineering\ntechnologies to automate CAR T cell culture. The goal of Project 2 is to generate universal CAR T cells\n(UCART) using advanced genetic editing technologies and then to compare UCAR to autologous CAR\nT in a unique model of canine cancer. In Project 3 we will use advanced protein engineering, cell\nengineering and oncolytic vectors to test synthetic cytokine and cytokine receptor systems in mouse\nand human T cells, with the long-term goal of eliminating or reducing the need for lymphodepleting\nconditioning chemotherapy prior to adoptive cell transfer. Our approach is multidisciplinary and multi-\ninstitutional. We have brought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines\nwho have collaborated and published together for many years. State of the art genetic editing with\nCRISPR/Cas9 and cell culture technologies at the University of Pennsylvania are synergistically\ncoupled with world-class protein engineering and structural biology at Stanford University. Each project\nis led by recognized authorities in the field.\nThe Administrative Core for this U54 is designed to manage and coordinate all i3 Center Research\nProject activities and serve as the liaison between the i3 Center and the IOTN Data Management and\nResource-sharing Center (U24) and other Cancer Moonshot consortia, including the Pediatric\nImmunotherapy Discovery and Development Network (PI-DDN). In addition, the Administrative Core\nwill coordinate collaborative research activities between the i3 Center Research Project PD(s)/PI(s) and\nIOTN (or other) investigators. The potential for paradigm-shifting impact this U54 is to transform the\nlessons of first-generation CAR T for leukemia and lymphoma into meaningful efficacy against all\nmalignancies.

project	1U54CA244719-01	U54CA244719	9870537	2019	Nano-Immuno-Oncology Approaches to Overcome Tumor Immune Evasion	Grant	Abstract\n While immunotherapies have achieved remarkable success in cancer care in recent years, a large\npercentage of patients remain unresponsive to currently available treatments. Growing evidence\nindicates dysfunctional innate and adaptive immune responses in the tumor microenvironment are\nresponsible for tumor evasion that limits the efficacy of the current immunotherapies. Efficacious cancer\nimmunotherapy requires a holistic, system approach to identify and engage key molecular and cellular\npathways as well as tumor microenvironment signals to benefit a broad spectrum of cancer patients.\nThe overarching goal of this U54 i3 Center application is to harness research synergy in immunobiology,\nprotein engineering and cancer nanotechnology to develop and validate new nano-immuno-oncology\ntherapeutics for cancer therapy. Four investigators, Zhijian `James' Chen, Yang-Xin Fu, Baran Sumer,\nand Jinming Gao, supported by the Administrative Core, will advance the frontier of knowledge of\nmolecular and cellular engineering of the tumor immune milieu for robust antitumor immunity. Each\nproject will bring a unique toolset and therapeutic strategy to tackle the immune refractory challenges in\nsolid tumors. Dr. Chen will lead Project 1 to investigate the role of cGAS-STING pathway in intrinsic\ntumor immunity and evaluate antitumor efficacy of cGAMP nanoparticles in endogenous tumor models.\nDr. Fu will lead Project 2 to engineer tumor-targeted delivery of CD47 and T cell activators (IL-2/IL-15) to\nstimulate innate and adaptive antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Dr. Gao and Dr. Sumer\nwill lead Project 3 to establish CD47-encoded ultra-pH sensitive nanoparticles as a broad nanoplatform\nfor tumor-targeted delivery of innate and adaptive immune modulators. If successful, our studies will\ndevelop innovative and synergistic combinations of small molecular agonists, engineered antibodies and\ncytokines, and pH sensitive nanoparticle technology. The U54 i3 Center will create a new paradigm for\ncancer immunotherapy by targeting key molecular, cellular and tumor microenvironment signals to\ngenerate and sustain tumor-specific innate and adaptive immunity. Ultimately, this paradigm could\nsignificantly advance clinical care for patients with intractable cancers.

project	1U54CA244726-01	U54CA244726	9870084	2019	Biomaterials to Create T Cell Immunity	Grant	Summary – Overall:\nT lymphocyte (T cell) responses against tumor antigens are key to cancer immunotherapy, and this proposal is\nfocused on enhancing T cell mediated anti-cancer immunity using biomaterials. Defects in T cell number,\ndifferentiation, activation and anti-cancer activity can compromise anti-cancer immunity. We envision\nbiomaterials that act at various stages of T cell differentiation and activation to enhance anti-cancer immunity in\na number of settings. This i3 Center will advance efficacious biomaterial-based immunotherapies through\nmarrying the expertise in bioengineering from accomplished investigators at the Wyss Institute for Biologically\nInspired Engineering with the expertise in cancer immunology, stem cell biology, and clinical oncology from\naccomplished basic and translational scientists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General\nHospital. Our groups have made major contributions to the development of checkpoint blockade therapy,\nneoantigen vaccines, cellular therapies, and therapeutic biomaterials in the past, and here will take a material-\nbased approach to address a number of related, fundamental questions in immunoengineering. The Specific\nAims of the i3 Center are: (1) To develop artificial antigen presenting cells that closely mimic normal T cell\nactivation to selectively expand large numbers of highly functional polyclonal antigen-specific CD8 T cells, and\nexplore if adoptive transfer of polyclonal T cells will provide tumor control. (2) Determine if co-delivery of\nneoantigens and adjuvants with precise nanoscale distribution and stoichiometric loading, using DNA origami,\ncan provide a powerful platform to boost the development of cytotoxic T lymphocyte anti-cancer responses, and\n(3) Create biomaterials which recreate key features of the normal hematopoietic stem cell niche, and utilize to\nenable rapid reconstitution of T cells in settings where there are deficiencies in T cell number and repertoire, in\norder to enhance generation of T cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity. The leadership and organizational\nstructure of the i3 Center, which includes a Biostatistics Core, reflect the close collaboration among the\nparticipating disciplines and institutions, and will promote the effective execution of the proposed work and its\nfuture translation to clinical testing. The synergistic set of activities in the i3 not only address specific stages\nwhere immune control can fail, but the lessons learned and technologies developed in each project strongly\nimpact the others. The Center is expected to yield major scientific and translational advances in cancer\nimmunotherapy.

project	1UG3CA233229-01	UG3CA233229	9627196	2018	ACCISIS-Chicago	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nScreening for colorectal cancer (CRC) not only detects disease early but also prevents cancer by finding and\nremoving precancerous polyps. The overall goal of our project, Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening\nand Follow-up through Implementation Science in Chicago (ACCSIS-Chicago), is to test a multilevel,\nmulticomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among\nracial/ethnic minority and low income populations in Chicago, Illinois. In this project, we will include two\ndifferent types of implementation strategies: 1) evidence-based multilevel, multicomponent intervention to\nincrease rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care; and 2) implementation support strategies to\nsupport the implementation process that contribute to the adoption, implementation and sustainment of our\nproposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention. We will partner with 4 federally qualified health centers\n(FQHCs), which have 35 clinics in the Chicago area and provided primary care service to nearly 188,000\nracial/ethnic minority and low income populations in 2016. During the UG3 Planning-Exploratory Phase, we will\nwork with one of the 4 FQHC partners to pilot test, measure, and refine our proposed multilevel,\nmulticomponent intervention in preparation for the experimental trial in the UH3 Implementation Phase, as well\nas assess the effectiveness of our implementation support strategies. In the UH3 Implementation Phase, we\nwill use a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and impact of our\nmultilevel, multicomponent intervention on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care\nacross our 4 partner FQHCs. The selection of our intervention components will be based on intensive literature\nreview, and findings and lessons learned from our previous studies and projects. Our multilevel intervention\ncomponents will include EMR provider reminders, provider assessment and feedback, patient navigation,\nprovider education and community outreach. We will also test one local innovation, IL ColonCARES, during the\nUGH Phase to increase the rate of follow-up after a positive stool test among uninsured patients by linking\nuninsured patients with specialty services. We expect the finding from this study to have broad impact on\nunderstanding the implementation process to increase colorectal cancer screening, follow up, and referral to\ncare across diverse health systems.

project	1UG3CA233251-01	UG3CA233251	9627357	2018	Scaling Colorectal Cancer Screening Through Outreach, Referral, and Engagement (SCORE): A State-Level Program to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Burden in Vulnerable Populations	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nDespite strong evidence that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces mortality, rates of CRC screening,\nfollow-up, and referral-to-care (herein referred to as “CRC screening”) remain suboptimal in the US. In North\nCarolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions.\nCommunity health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable\npopulations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%.\nSubstantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and\nsystem-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening\ntargets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based\nscreening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase\nscreening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to\nsystematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for\nuninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from\nstakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We\nhypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective\napproaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through\nimproved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research,\nimplementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central\nhypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based\ninterventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable.\nThe specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention\nto increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot\nstudies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a\nprocess for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2\n(Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening\napproaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess\nimplementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the\nmultilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This\nproject is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation\nmodeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact\non CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities.

Specifically, the\nAppalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern\nKentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the\narea are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents\nscreened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence\non CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of\nKentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with\nAppalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention\nand control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted\nfrom evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the\ncommunity (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in\n12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base\nfor a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically\nunderserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden\nof CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test,\nmeasure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH\nand Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI\napproval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI\nin a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC\nscreening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2)\nAssess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with\ncommunity and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to\nearly or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined\nby US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county-\nlevel behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk\nFactor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating\nCenter, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community\npartners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia.

Grant	ABSTRACT\nColorectal cancer (CRC) screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality. The US\nPreventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends CRC screening through a variety of invasive and non-\ninvasive tests for individuals aged 50 to 75 years.

The hub will be\nHealth Quality Partners of Southern California (HQP), a non-profit organization comprised of 16 CHC systems\n(spokes), serving 135 rural and urban clinic sites. We propose a 2-phase study to pilot and optimize (Phase I)\nand rigorously test (Phase II) the Hub and Spoke approach and its impact on CRC screening, follow-up, and\nusual care. UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary\noutcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed\nmethods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients\nserved by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and\ncoordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3\nImplementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a\nregionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care\namong CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability\nModel (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,\nMaintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness\nof the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post\nimplementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3)\nproportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and\nsustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods\napproach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM\nconstructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e.\npatients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and\nSustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of\nImplementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate\nprogress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are\nscalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.

Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up\ncolonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing\nprogram with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage\npartnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest\nCenter for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation\nsupport to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate\nworking with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics\n(reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients).\nIn Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a\nlarge-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor\nsupported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never\nbeen screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to\nsupport follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and\nrecruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the\ntraining and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings.\nIn Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi-\nexperimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice\nfacilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan-\nvendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never\nbeen screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred\nfor colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will\nevaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and\nqualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program\nthrough partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care\nclinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO\n(Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model.

Among patients with NF1, loss of\nthe non-mutant allele of NF1 in a rare Schwann cell or precursor, along with other ill-defined factors, leads to\nbenign dermal or plexiform neurofibromas. The main cause of death among NF1 patients is the malignant\nperipheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most likely develops\nfrom plexiform neurofibroma, in particular the so-called “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma. Approximately half of\nMPNSTs are NF1-associated, and NF1 patients have 10-15% lifetime risk of developing this terrible cancer.\nMPNSTs metastasize early and are often resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main treatment for\nMPNSTs is surgical resection but, despite radical excision with wide surgical margins, followed by\nchemoradiation, 5-year survival rates are poor due to metastases as well as local recurrence. NF1 patients\ncould greatly benefit from prophylactic vaccination that would prevent the malignant transformation of benign\nplexiform neurofibromas into “atypical” plexiform neurofibromas and to MPNSTs. We aim to determine if the\nmutations that govern the development of “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma (NF1 loss followed by CDKN2A\nloss) and MPSNT (NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12 loss) lead to the expression of recurrent alternately processed\ntranscripts, such as transcriptionally-induced chimeras, that could express neoantigens and be used as targets\nfor prophylactic vaccines. Such transcripts can be translated to produce novel peptides downstream of\nframeshift mutations caused by coding exon read-through into introns, mis-splicing from a coding exon to a\nnon-canonical splice acceptors or splice acceptors in other genes. In most cases, a premature termination\ncodon (PTC) will be rapidly encountered by the ribosome translating such transcripts. Therefore, we\nfurthermore hypothesize that these alternately processed transcripts can express what we call “cryptic”\nneoantigens when treated with drugs that suppress utilization of premature codons such as Ataluren or\ngentamycin. In such a way, we could administer a prophylactic vaccine and induce conditionally active immune\nresponse that would eliminate nascent tumors only when drug treatment is used.

project	1UG3CA244697-01	UG3CA244697	9870498	2019	Intercepting progression from pre-invasive to invasive lung adenocarcinoma	Grant	Abstract\nDespite advances in therapeutic strategies, non-small cell lung cancer remains a deadly disease. An\nimproved understanding of the biology of lung cancer is needed to intercept the disease at an early point in\nits progression. Our project, which is inspired by that challenge, focuses on events transpiring in the earliest\nradiographically-detected manifestation of lung cancer: the computerized tomography (CT)-detected non-\nsolid nodule, of which as many as 40% harbor frankly invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, despite conventional\nwisdom that CT-detected non-solid nodules represent pre or minimally invasive malignancy, clearly transition\nto more invasive histologies occurs in a significant proportion of these nodules.\nUnderstanding the cellular and molecular changes within non-solid nodules that drive progression will provide\nunique and novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that\nalterations in cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a role in initiating and supporting this\nprogression. In agreement with that proposal, our preliminary multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) studies\nsuggest that progression to a more invasive phenotype is associated with the development of a strong\nimmunosuppressive TME. In this project we test our hypothesis using multidimensional methods to profile the\nTME and to determine the crosstalk between cancer cells and the TME in pre-invasive to invasive human\nlung non-solid adenocarcinomas. Comparative analysis of the cellular and molecular events associated with\nthe distinct histological stages will lead to identification of the critical events triggering progression and\nthereby identify targets to intercept disease progression. We will use appropriate mouse models in pre-clinical\nstudies to develop these targets as strategies to intercept progression of pre-invasive to invasive cancer.\nIn the first phase of these studies (UG3 phase), we will define TME alterations associated with progression of\nlung nodules using RNAseq profiling and image-based methods (multiplex IF and imaging CyTOF) in studies\nof our archival tumor samples. These studies will generate a comprehensive catalogue of the cellular and\nmolecular events that trigger progression of indolent lesions to frankly invasive cancers, with a strong focus\non immune mechanisms. These analyses will provide novel and detailed insights into how the composition\nand activity of the TME changes with progression. In the second phase (UH3 phase), we will leverage mouse\nmodels to explore interception strategies to target immune mechanisms and prevent progression.\nThe proposed cohort satisfies the RFA’s focus on High-Risk Cohorts for Cancer-Immunoprevention Studies,\nsince lung nodules are premalignancies highly prevalent in smokers.

project	1UH2CA263954-01	UH2CA263954	10300193	2021	Imaging the native 3D architecture of pancreatic and breast tumor patient tissue at single-cell resolution	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nCancer remains the second-leading cause of adult death in the United States, yet the mechanisms by which\ncancerous growths are initiated and how crucial transitions such as metastasis and therapeutic resistance occur\nare not well understood. Significant progress has been made in the multiplexed analysis of solid tumors through\nthe use of single-cell sequencing and spatio-molecular mapping techniques. However, despite the unique\ninsights into tumor heterogeneity these methods have afforded, they are limited to two-dimensional (2D) thin\nanalyses which provide little information on the native three-dimensional architecture of the tumor. Serial\nreconstruction can provide some three-dimensional context, but such approaches are both inefficient in terms of\nsample throughput and are inherently destructive to the tissue architecture. We propose a cross-disciplinary,\napproach to quantitatively characterize the native three-dimensional architecture of human solid tumor tissue\nfrom triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients using a\ncombination of the state-of-the art, yet mature technologies of tissue clearing, immunofluorescence and in situ\nhybridization labeling, and high-resolution lightsheet fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of these tissue volumes\nwill enable the elucidation of the spatial interactome of different tumor, immune and stromal cells that give rise\nto tumor heterogeneity as well as their interactions with components of the tumor microenvironment. Our Specific\nAims are (1) to image the three-dimensional spatial distribution of tumor, immune and stromal cells in relation to\nvasculature, lymphatics and the extracellular matrix in native solid tumor tissue from human pancreatic and\nbreast malignancies using a combination of tissue clearing, immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization and 3D\nlightsheet microscopy, and (2) to develop a computational pipeline to build three-dimensional spatial maps of\nprotein expression and RNA transcript localization in intact solid tumor tissue from human pancreatic and breast\nmalignancies.\nThe innovation of the proposed work lies in our cross-disciplinary strategy of combining the cutting-\nedge tissue clearing, multiplexed labelling and high-resolution lightsheet microscopy to better understand the\nnative three-dimensional architecture of solid tumors. Specifically, by classifying and quantitating previously\nunknown three-dimensional features of solid tumor tissue we will be able to relate the spatial organization of the\ntumor to genomic and proteomic data taken from the same specimen. The significance of this proposal is that\nsuccessful three-dimensional characterization of human tumor tissues will enable key insights to be derived on\nboth intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity thus facilitating the identification of cell-cell and cell-microenvironment\ninteractions that could serve as potential therapeutic targets thus providing new routes to treatments to decrease\npatient mortality and improve quality of life.	3-Dimensional;Address;Adult;Architecture;Atlases;Breast;Breast Cancer Patient;CD8B1 gene;CXCL14 gene;Cancerous;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Cessation of life;Collagen;Complex;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;DNA;Data;Data Set;Detection;Diagnosis;Extracellular Matrix;FBXW7 gene;Fluorescence Microscopy;Genomics;Growth;Human;Image;Imaging Techniques;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;In Situ Hybridization;Inter-tumoral heterogeneity;Label;Lymphatic;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Maps;Methods;Microscopy;Molecular;Neoplasm Metastasis;Optics;PECAM1 gene;Pancreas;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Population;Proteomics;Quality of life;RNA;Reporter;Research;Resolution;Route;Sampling;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Spatial Distribution;Specimen;Speed;Stains;Stromal Cells;Techniques;Technology;Thinness;Three-Dimensional Imaging;Tissue Sample;Tissues;Transcript;Tumor Tissue;United States;Universities;Vimentin;Visualization;Washington;Woman;Work;analysis pipeline;breast malignancies;cell type;cellular imaging;computational pipelines;computational suite;computerized tools;dimensional analysis;experimental study;human tissue;imaging approach;improved;innovation;insight;lymphatic vasculature;men;molecular imaging;mortality;neoplastic cell;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell;pancreatic neoplasm;protein biomarkers;protein expression;reconstruction;single cell sequencing;spatial relationship;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;two-dimensional	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	SAINT LOUIS	MO	UNITED STATES	James Alexander Fitzpatrick,Tao  Ju,Stephen Tracy Oh	DCB	Shannon K Hughes	360281	$250k to $499k	360281	3-Aug-2021	3-Aug-2021	31-Jul-2023	RFA-CA-20-042	Moonshot
project	1UM1CA233033-01	UM1CA233033	9625964	2018	Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) Pragmatic Clinical Trial	Grant	Cancer and its treatment engender disabling symptoms that are frequently undertreated, and associated with\nneedlessly increased healthcare utilization, non-adherence to oncologic treatments, and reduced survival. The\nkey to addressing this damaging situation lies in reliably detecting symptoms and providing evidence-based\ncare. Of note, the National Academy of Medicine has identified systematic screening with patient reported\noutcomes (PROs) as critical, not only to symptom control, but also to enhancing the patient centricity and\neffectiveness of cancer care in general. Unfortunately, experience has shown that simply presenting PRO data\nto over-loaded, treatment-focused clinicians has minimal or no impact on the outcomes of patients with many\ndiseases, including cancer. On the other hand, providing these data to mid-level providers and entrusting them\nto initiate, monitor and adapt individually tailored symptom management plans has proven robustly effective in\nthe control of cancer-related and other symptoms. However, the high resource requirements of this approach\nhave heretofore limited its dissemination and scalability. Encouragingly, such resource intense care is not\nalways required for meaningfully benefit, as attested by the effectiveness of interventions that provide patients\nexperiencing mild or moderate with self-management education. This application recognizes the need for both\nlow- and high-touch approaches to cancer symptom control and proposes the Enhanced, EHR-facilitated\nCancer Symptom Control (E2C2) pragmatic clinical trial to test a bundled intervention that leverages EHR\ninterface and clinical decision support functionalities to operationalize the population-level implementation of an\napproach that automatically triages symptomatic patients to low-touch automated self-management (Level 1),\nor high-touch nurse care management (Level 2), both validated, depending on PRO scores, as well as patient\nand clinical factors. The E2C2 intervention will target Sleep disturbance, Pain, Anxiety, Depression, and\nEnergy deficit/fatigue, the SPADE pentad which represents the most prevalent and potentially treatable group\nof overlapping cancer symptoms. To rigorously assess the effectiveness of discrete E2C2 intervention\ncomponents, we will initially test a Stage 1 Symptom Control Bundle for 12 months, after which we will add\na Stage 2 Implementation Bundle. The trial's stepped wedge design will randomize the order of E2C2\nimplementation among 21 clusters. Clusters will be defined at the level of the cancer care team, and will be\nrandomized to one of five different tranches to receive the intervention at staggered 6 month intervals.\nOutcomes will include SPADE symptom scores (primary), physical function, social participation, quality of life,\ndistress, healthcare utilization, adherence to cancer treatment, and vital status which will be collected for 9-12\nmonths during each trial phase; pre-E2C2, Stage 1 and Stage 2. A multi-stakeholder, mixed methods\napproach will be used to comprehensively assess the impact of the Stage 2 Implementation Bundle, as well as\nboth Stages' impact on rurally-based and elderly patients, groups prone to disparities in symptom control.

Despite the\ndevelopment of improved symptom management interventions, and several evidence- and consensus-based\nguidelines, their timely delivery remains uneven in the health care system. Our research center, Northwestern\nUniversity IMPACT (NU IMPACT), builds upon an integrated cancer symptom monitoring and management\nsystem (NMPRO), currently deployed by our health care delivery system. We will test the effectiveness of a\nsystem-wide symptom management intervention when implemented across the Northwestern Memorial\nHealthCare Corporation (NMHC) outpatient oncology clinics. Using a clinic-level randomized roll-out\nimplementation trial design, we will further test, using an embedded patient-level randomized controlled clinical\ntrial, the effectiveness of an enhanced care (EC) approach aimed to engage participants actively, and to\nincrease self-efficacy, in the monitoring and managing of their symptoms. The existing NMPRO will constitute\nusual care (UC), and added patient engagement and activation features will comprise the EC condition. This\ninnovative hybrid trial design allows for a within- and between-site evaluation of implementation along with a\nsufficiently powered group-based comparison to demonstrate effectiveness on individual patient outcomes.\n We propose three specific aims that target both patient- and system-level outcomes. Aim 1: Implement a\nfully-integrated oncology symptom assessment and management program across six clinical units that are part\nof the NMHC healthcare delivery system; Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the program by conducting a hybrid\nType I effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the enhanced care program (EC: symptom monitoring &\nself-management intervention), relative to usual care (UC) on patient- and system-level outcomes; Aim 3:\nIdentify facilitators and barriers to implementation and disseminate to other health systems. We will enroll an\nestimated 12,671 participants. To address possible contamination effects within each clinical unit, and allow for\nunit-level data collection for pre- and post-implementation comparison within and across clinical units, 50% will\nbe enrolled and followed prior to program implementation. The other half will be enrolled post-implementation\nand will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (stratified by sex and cancer phase; curative intent, non-curative\nintent & survivorship) to UC versus EC. Fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression will be assessed using\nPROMIS® computerized adaptive tests (CATs). In addition, we will assess patient clinical outcomes, including\nhealthcare utilization, and cancer treatment delivery outcomes. The NU IMPACT study design allows joint\nevaluation of system-level implementation and patient-level effectiveness metrics. An extensive array of\nlongitudinal EHR data will be integrated using custom informatics tools and deployed for statistical analysis\nusing plans that blend psychometric and biostatistical outcome evaluation models. Successful elements of this\nintervention approach will then be extended to widespread adoption.

project	1UM1CA233080-01	UM1CA233080	9626037	2018	SIMPRO Research Center: Integration and Implementation of PROs for Symptom Management in Oncology Practice	Grant	Project Summary\nIn 2018, more than 1.7 million Americans will receive a new cancer diagnosis and nearly 600,000 will die from\ntheir disease. Cancer treatments, including major surgical resection and palliative chemotherapy, are\nassociated with frequent adverse symptoms. The primary burden for managing symptoms falls on patients and\ntheir caregivers, and there is ample evidence that untreated symptoms impair quality of life, lead to inefficient\nuse of emergency care, avoidable hospitalizations, and even shorten survival. Electronic tracking of patient-\nreported outcomes (ePROs) between face-to-face clinic visits has been shown to both reduce symptom burden\nand decrease the need for acute care. Although there is abundant evidence that symptom monitoring can\nimprove cancer care, current experience has been largely limited to single centers or as part of clinical trials.\nUsing ePROs to facilitate symptom control is an attractive strategy but, evidence for effectiveness in different\ntreatment contexts and across varied populations is needed. Further, ePRO tracking systems have not been\nfully integrated into health systems' electronic health records (EHR) and this deficit prevents them from\ndelivering the maximal benefits of proactive symptom management.\nTo fill gaps in the evidence base about the optimal strategy for deploying ePROs, a multidisciplinary team from\n6 health systems have formed the Symptom Management IMplementation of Patient Reported Outcomes in\nOncology (SIMPRO) Research Center. SIMPRO's overarching goal is to develop, implement, and evaluate a\nmulti-component ePRO reporting and management system to improve symptom control for patients recovering\nfrom cancer surgery or patients receiving palliative chemotherapy in small, rural, and community cancer\ncenters. The Specific Aims of the project are to: (1) Adapt existing ePRO symptom management systems and\nintegrate them into the EHR and routine clinical workflow at six health systems; (2) Determine the effectiveness\nof an EHR-integrated ePRO symptom management system on health outcomes; and (3) Evaluate the\nfacilitators and barriers to implementation of an EHR-integrated ePRO symptom management system from the\npatient, clinical and organizational perspectives. Following the adaptation of operational ePRO prototypes and\nfull integration into an EHR, the SIMPRO investigators will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial with\nstepped wedge rollout to investigate the effectiveness of a symptom monitoring system from a patient, clinician\nand health system perspective. Across all study phases, the implementation process itself, including ePRO\nadoption, appropriateness, acceptability, penetration/scalability, and adaptation, will be critically evaluated.\nThis approach will create knowledge that can be used to guide dissemination of ePROs and other interventions\nto improve cancer care delivery.

project	2P01CA154303-06	P01CA154303	9279632	2017	Protein Kinase Therapeutic Targets for Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma	Grant	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and world-wide, with over 85% of\ncases due to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The goal of our Program is to advance the pre-clinical\nscience of NSCLC therapeutics. During the current funding period, our Program has advanced inhibitors of\nEGFR, promoting the pre-clinical development of osimertinib and related molecules, of TBK1, and of DDR2. In\nits next 5 years, our Program aims to develop compounds that will lead to more effective treatments for\nNSCLC and prevent or overcome resistance to existing and future targeted therapies.\n To accomplish these goals, the Program seeks to achieve the following overall aims via 3 inter-related and\ncollaborative Projects and 4 intellectually driven Shared Resource Cores.\n--Overall Aim 1. Develop inhibitors and/or degraders focused on mutant EGFR, KRAS signaling effectors, and\nmechanisms of transcriptional adaptation in non-small cell lung cancer.\n--Overall Aim 2. Characterize these compounds and their targets pharmacologically using genetically defined\ncellular and animal models of lung cancer.\n--Overall Aim 3. Develop and assess combinations of these potent and selective novel agents with existing\ntherapies to prevent and overcome therapeutic resistance.\n These aims leverage innovations in chemistry and structural biology—the development of allosteric kinase\ninhibitors and selective degraders—coupled with expertise in lung cancer biology, lung cancer cellular and\nanimal modeling, and functional genomic approaches to understanding pathways, through the Projects and\nCores. The broad aims will be implemented with three focused projects aimed at developing inhibitors of key\npathways in NSCLC as well as over-arching mechanisms of resistance:\n--Project 1: Development of pharmacologic strategies to degrade mutant EGFR.\n--Project 2: Identification of combination therapy for KRAS-driven lung cancers.\n--Project 3: Targeting transcriptional mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.\n Each Project and the overall Program is based on the innovative, technology-driven Cores, each led by\nfaculty with expertise in the specific areas.\nCore A: Medicinal Chemistry.\nCore B: Structure and Biochemistry.\nCore C: Animal Modeling and Preclinical Therapeutics.\nCore D: Program Administration.\n The integration of the three Projects and the four Cores will enable an effective co-ordination to meet\nProgram aims by cross-fertilization of lung cancer focus and technological expertise.

project	2P01CA155258-06	P01CA155258	9209424	2017	Integrative Oncogenomics of Multiple Myeloma	Grant	Project Summary (Overall)\nThis renewal application stems from our successful first four years of a new program project grant funded in\n2011, which brings together a talented group of investigators with expertise in basic biology (DFCI and\nWhitehead Institute at MIT), clinical science (IFM), as well as genomic and cell signaling (Sanger Institute UK\nand DFCI). During the prior 4 years of funding period, we have 1. defined the role of transplant in the era of\nnovel agents; 2 Established the role of molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) in myeloma. 3. Established\nthe role of both MRI and PET/CT in diagnosis and follow up of MM patients. 4. Identified and Validated number\nof novel targets. and 5. Defined patterns of clonal evolution and mutational signatures being utilized in MM.\nOur program has also developed novel targeted sequencing platform, developed a pipeline to identify\nmutations using RNA-seq, and developed a publicly available data analysis portal (Canevolve.org). Building on\nthese advances, The overall specific objectives of the program are 1) To determine whether maintenance can\nbe tailored based upon MRD status and whether achieving MRD negative status provides superior outcome In\na 1260 patient randomized clinical study and to develop novel risk model (Project 1). Clinically annotated\npatient samples from this clinical trial will be utilized to study genomic and epigenomic correlates; 2) To identify\nthe spectrum of epigenomic lesions and enhancer dependencies that underlie pathogenesis, progression, and\nclinical outcome in MM. (Project 2). New clinically-relevant epigenomic-centered targets identified will be\nvalidated further; 3) To identify and validate the molecular circuits/loops responsible for continued MM cell\ngrowth and develop strategies to interrupt these loops as a novel therapeutic approach. (Project 3). New\ntargeted therapeutic agents will be translated to clinical trials to improve patient outcome; and 4) To define the\nimpact of therapy on clonal evolution and identify mediators of genomic instability underlying disease prognosis\nand progression in MM (Project 4). New clinically relevant processes identified will be used to understand\nprocess of progression. These 4 projects will be supported by Administrative and Communication Core (1),\nClinical and Tissue Core (2); Genomics Core (3); Genomic Sequencing Core (4) and Biostatistical and\nBioinformatics Cores (5). This unique collaborative effort will improve our understanding of myeloma biology\nand define a new treatment paradigm for this presently incurable disease.

project	2P50CA186786-06	P50CA186786	9791695	2019	Michigan Prostate SPORE	Grant	Since inception in 1995, the University of Michigan (U-M) Prostate SPORE has endeavored to tap the vast\nintellectual and physical resources of the U-M community to decrease the morbidity and mortality of prostate\ncancer (PCa). In this renewal application, U-M joins forces with Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) to propose a\n“Michigan Prostate SPORE” leveraging our institutions' respective areas of strength. KCI has a non-overlapping\npatient population as U-M, which includes an underserved population. The Michigan Prostate SPORE supports\nan interactive group of basic and clinical investigators in a translational research program that has led to major\ndiscoveries in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of PCa. Successful translation of discoveries in the\nmost recent grant period include: 1) The ETS gene fusions (which were discovered by this SPORE program)\nhave been established as a urine test for the early detection of PCa (JAMA Oncology 2017 3:1085) and have\nbeen therapeutically targeted with peptidomimetic inhibitors (Cancer Cell 2017 31:844). 2) Our SPORE program\nplayed a significant role in defining the clinically actionable landscape of metastatic castration-resistant prostate\ncancer (mCRPC) (Cell 2015, 162:454) which led to the discovery that upwards of 20-25% of mCRPC harbor\ndefects in DNA repair genes. As part of the TO-PARP study, we showed that mCRPC patients with DNA repair\ndefects preferentially respond to PARP inhibitors (NEJM 2015, 373:1697). 3) Established that BET bromodomain\ninhibitors may be useful in the treatment of advanced PCa by blocking oncogenic transcription factor activity\n(Nature 2014, 510:278). 4) Several PCa-associated long non-coding RNAs, including PCAT1, Schlap1 (Nature\nGenetics 2013 45:1392), and ARlnc1 (Nature Genetics 2018, 50:814) were discovered and characterized. These\nbench-to-bedside applications were aided by horizontal collaborations with the University of Washington,\nDana Farber, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and Weill-Cornell Prostate SPOREs as well as the EDRN and vertical\ncollaborations with SWOG and biotech companies. This application consists of four projects: Project 1:\nTargeting mCRPC Patients with Biallelic Loss of CDK12; Project 2: Integrating a Novel MiPS-Based Next-\nGeneration Sequencing Urine Assay for the Early Detection of Unfavorable Risk PCa; Project 3: Exploring\nAblation of the Androgen Receptor as a Therapeutic Approach for mCRPC; Project 4: Targeting Autophagy in\nthe Treatment of mCRPC. These projects are complemented by strong, ongoing institutional commitments of\nmoney and space, successful Career Development and Developmental Research Programs, and three\ncores: Administration, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics, and Biospecimen/Pathology. The Michigan Prostate\nSPORE continues to place premiums on rigorous scientific review of its translational research programs, pairing\nof basic and clinical investigators, drawing on expertise of scientists from within and from outside the PCa field,\nand utilizing flexibility to fund promising new research approaches. The interaction of our multidisciplinary group\nof investigators clearly makes the Michigan Prostate SPORE greater than the sum of its individual parts.

project	2R01AR050026-12A1	R01AR050026	9323617	2017	Inflammation and Cardiovascular Disease in Rheumatoid Arthritis	Grant	ABSTRACT\nIndividuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at 50% greater risk for developing heart failure (HF) and HF-\nassociated morbidity and mortality than non-RA controls. This risk persists even after adjustment for coronary\nartery disease, implying that immunologic and inflammatory factors intrinsic to RA contribute to the increased\nrisk of HF. Our overall hypothesis is that myocardial inflammation and microvascular ischemia are prevalent in\nRA patients, are mediated by antibodies to myocardial citrullinated proteins, promote impairment of left\nventricular (LV) structure/function, and are attenuated with RA therapies. Indeed, in 128 RA patients without\nclinical CVD who underwent [18fluoro-deoxyglucose] positron emission-computed tomography (FDG PET-CT)\n(the RHYTHM study), we observed FDG uptake (inflammation) in 35% and impaired myocardial blood flow\nreserve (MFR) in 29%. Both myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR were strongly associated with clinical\nand laboratory measures of RA disease activity; impaired MFR was also associated with higher LV mass, a\nknown precursor of HF. These data suggest that myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR mediate, in part,\nearly changes in LV structure/function that predate clinical HF; but it is critical to confirm these relationships in\nlongitudinal studies. Proximal events that mediate myocardial pathology in RA are unknown. We hypothesize\nthat antibodies against citrullinated myocardial proteins (APCAs) mediate, in part, this abnormal myocardial\nphenotype (inflammation and impaired MFR), leading to myocardial remodeling and ultimately to functional\ndecline. Our preliminary data demonstrating seroreactivity in 30% of RHYTHM sera in a novel myocardial\nprotein array support this hypothesis. A related question is whether tumor necrosis inhibitors (TNFi’s) affect\nmyocardial inflammation. This is a far from insignificant question as TNFi’s were associated with increased HF\nhospitalizations and death in non-RA HF patients and their risk for HF in RA is still unclear despite widespread\nuse. In the next funding period, we seek to extend the study period for the RHYTHM cohort for aims 1 and 3,\nand to utilize an independently funded study (TARGET) for aim 2, in order to investigate the following aims:\n1) To determine if imaging indicators of myocardial pathology at baseline (inflammation, impaired\nMFR) are predictive of longitudinal (adverse) change in measures of LV structure and function over 4-6\nyears in RA patients without clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline.\n2) To determine, in a currently enrolling NIH-NIAMS funded randomized clinical trial (the TARGET\nstudy), if RA therapies reduce myocardial inflammation.\n3) To determine if seroreactivity to citrullinated myocardial antigens in RHYTHM participants is\nassociated with baseline myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR and/or with change over time in\nparameters of LV structure/function. These investigations will advance understanding of mechanisms that\ncontribute to and mitigate increased risk of myocardial dysfunction in RA.

project	2R01CA121118-11A1	R01CA121118	10120567	2021	A High-Throughput Model for Human Melanoma	Grant	Significant advances in melanoma research have resulted in new therapies that have remarkably improved the\nmanagement and overall survival of melanoma. However, many patients still succumb to the disease and more\nthan half of all melanoma deaths are due to brain metastases. As a means to overcome this challenge, we\ndeveloped a novel mouse model that allows postnatal delivery of genes of interest to melanocytes. Using\ngenomic and proteomic data from human melanoma samples, we tested several gene combinations for their\nability to induce metastatic melanoma in vivo. Hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the context of mutant\nBRAF and CDKN2A loss resulted in the development of spontaneous melanoma with full penetrance and a\nmean survival of only 6 weeks. The majority of these mice also developed multiple metastases to the lungs and\nbrain. This model mimics the human disease genetically, histologically, and by sites of metastasis. Importantly,\nthis model system provides a powerful platform to further study the mechanisms of melanoma metastasis.\nElucidation of this network will allow the identification of key pathway nodes that represent potential therapeutic\ntargets to disrupt this process. We used next generation sequencing and proteomics analysis of non-metastatic\nand metastatic tumor samples to identify downstream targets of AKT1 implicated in melanoma brain metastasis.\nOur data showed that tumors expressing activated AKT1 displayed elevated levels of focal adhesion (FA) factors\nand phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (P-FAK). In addition, mutant AKT1 expression increased invasion and\nthis was reduced by pharmacological inhibition of either AKT or FAK. Moreover, loss of PTEN, which also results\nin increased FAK activity, cooperated with activated AKT1 to further enhance brain metastasis in vivo. Despite\nthese promising preliminary findings, a critical gap still remains in understanding whether and how FAK promotes\nmelanoma brain metastasis, and whether the AKT1-FAK-PTEN axis can be exploited as a therapeutic target in\nthis disease. Our long-term goal is to use this knowledge to develop novel melanoma therapies and improve\npatient outcomes. Pursuant to this goal, we have generated a diverse collection of state-of-the-art research tools\nand assembled a talented team of scientists and clinicians with a track record of productive collaboration to carry\nout and critically evaluate the results of the proposed aims. Using these unique resources, we propose to test\nthe following hypotheses: 1) AKT1→ FAK signaling is essential for the development of melanoma brain\nmetastases; 2) Combined inhibition of BRAFV600E, MEK, and FAK is superior to standard of care targeted therapy\nand; 3) Loss of PTEN expression results in sustained FAK phosphorylation, which enhances the development\nof melanoma brain metastases. Successful completion of the aims in this proposal will significantly impact the\nfield by laying the groundwork for translation into clinical trials, leading to new and better treatments for patients\nwith brain metastases and those who are at high risk of developing brain metastases.

project	2R01CA124633-11A1	R01CA124633	9596560	2018	Pathogenesis and Treatment of NUT-Midline Carcinoma	Grant	Project Summary Abstract. NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), with a median survival of 6.7 months, is one of\nthe most aggressive solid tumors known. It is a subtype of squamous cell carcinoma characterized by\ntranslocation of the NUT (aka NUTM1) gene, most commonly forming a fusion to the double-bromodomain\nencoding protein (BET), BRD4. There is an urgent need for the identification of more specific therapeutic\ntargets in NMC. The over-reaching goal of this proposed project is to greater understand the mechanism of\nBRD4-NUT oncogenesis and identify effective therapeutic targets for treating this disease.\n BRD4-NUT functions to block differentiation and maintain proliferation of NMC cells, largely through\nactivation of MYC expression. This function is disrupted upon treatment with BET inhibitors, which as acetyl-\nlysine mimetics prevent binding of BRD4 bromodomains to acetylated chromatin. BRD4-NUT drives the\nexpression of pro-growth target genes, including MYC, through the formation of megabase-sized massive\nhyperacetylated 'megadomains'. BRD4-NUT megadomains arise from pre-existing active enhancers and\nspread to fill cell-type-specific topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are higher order genomic\nstructures whose function is to orchestrate cell-fate determining transcriptional programs through DNA-DNA\ncontacts. Unique proteins recruited by BRD4-NUT recently identified by our group include the histone acetyl-\ntransferase (HAT), p300, and several ZNF proteins collectively termed Z4. These findings indicate that BRD4-\nNUT ‘hijacks’ cell-type specific TADs to drive transcription of pro-growth, anti-differentiative genes as\npostulated in the following model: First, BRD4-NUT complex proteins seed regions corresponding to cell-type-\nspecific active TADs through the chromatin-binding of BRD4. Second, megadomains form from contiguous\nexpansion of BRD4-NUT complexes across chromatin in a feed-forward manner dependent upon p300 HAT\nactivity. Third, megadomain size is limited by TAD boundaries and HDAC activity recruited by the Z4 complex.\nFourth, hyperacetylated chromatin, recruitment of chromatin remodelers, and upregulation of cis lncRNAs\nchanges the chromatin configuration to enhance DNA-DNA interactions to drive transcription of key pro-\ngrowth, anti-differentiative genes. The goals of this proposal are to test this hypothetical model, as listed in the\nspecific aims below.\nAim 1. To determine how BRD4-NUT megadomains form.\nAim 2. To determine how BRD4-NUT megadomains function.\nImpact. Successful completion of the aims is expected to identify key BRD4-NUT-associated proteins in\npathologic megadomain formation, and will identify novel and possibly more effective therapeutic targets in\nNMC and other cancers. In addition, we predict that BRD4-NUT megadomains will provide a model with far-\nreaching impact on the structure-function relationship of chromatin conformation in cancer and development.

We aim to understand mechanisms underlying\noncogenic signaling and drug resistance in melanoma in order to improve the current treatment\noptions. The serine/threonine kinase, BRAF, is somatically mutated in ~50% of melanomas and\ndrives hyper-activation of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling, aberrant growth and invasion. While BRAF and\nMEK inhibitors are now first-line therapy for advanced-stage mutant V600E BRAF melanomas,\nthey only delay mortality. Thus, we must understand how to build on BRAF+MEK inhibitor\ntreatments and determine how to combine them with immune checkpoint agents, which remove the\nblocks on T cell action. In the previous cycle of this grant, we showed that up-regulation of FOXD3-\nErbB3 signaling is an adaptive response to BRAF inhibitors that promotes a state of drug tolerance\nin mutant BRAF melanoma. Furthermore, we showed that inhibition of ErbB3 enhanced the effects\nof BRAF inhibitors in mutant BRAF melanomas in vivo. In this current proposal, we aim to identify\nmechanisms regulating FOXD3 in mutant BRAF melanomas, test the possibility that epigenetic\nBET/BRD inhibitors will block adaptive responses to BRAF+MEK inhibitors and alter the tumor\nmicroenvironment, and determine how FOXD3 expression alters the infiltration/activation status of\ntumor-associated immune cell populations and the expression of putative immune checkpoint\nproteins. At the completion of our experiments, we expect to have identified tumor and stromal\nmarkers for adaptive responses to targeted therapy and informed future combinatorial targeted\ninhibitor, epigenetic inhibitor and immune-based therapeutic strategies in mutant BRAF melanoma.

A much larger number of tumors have\namplifications or deletions of these genes. These complexes are polymorphic assemblies of 15 subunits\nencoded by 28 genes giving rise to remarkable combinatorial specificity. This biologic specificity is reflected in\nthe highly selective pattern of oncogenic mutations in specific subunits in specific cancers. Cancer mutations\ngenerally have the characteristics of tumor suppressors and are generally heterozygous, implying that they\nplay a genetically dominant role in suppressing tumor formation. Work in our lab and others has led to the\nconclusion that the ability of these complexes to oppose polycomb-mediated repression contributes to their\nroles in both development and oncogenesis. Hence, we will focus our work on the mechanisms underlying the\nopposition between BAF and polycomb and its therapeutic consequences. First we will use a novel, newly\ndesigned in vivo chromatin remodeling assay to fully characterize the nature of the opposition on a minute-by-\nminute basis. Secondly, we will define the energetic requirements for BAF-polycomb opposition and the\nessential role of ATP in regulating binding and release of PRC1 from BAF. Third, we will fully characterize the\ndirect interaction between BAF and polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in terms of subunits and domains\nthat are essential for this interaction. Fourth, we will explore the consequences of disruption of BAF-polycomb\nopposition for repair, recombination and transcription over the genome. Finally, we will define the therapeutic\npotential of a group of small molecule BAF inhibitors that we identified in earlier screens. At the conclusion of\nthese studies we should have a mechanistic understanding of BAF-polycomb opposition and have explored at\nleast two potential paths for the production of cancer-specific drugs. 	ATPase Domain;Amino Acids;Binding;Biological Assay;Characteristics;Chromatin;Complex;Dependence;Development;Gene Deletion;Genes;Genetic Recombination;Genetic Transcription;Genetic study;Genome;Grant;Human;Human Genetics;Investigation;Kinetics;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Missense Mutation;Molecular;Mutation;Nature;Normal Cell;Oncogenic;PRC1 Protein;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Polycomb;Production;Proteins;Recurrence;Repression;Role;Specificity;Surface;System;Techniques;Therapeutic;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Work;base;cancer cell;chromatin remodeling;combinatorial;design;exome sequencing;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;novel;repaired;small molecule;tool;tumor;tumorigenesis	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	STANFORD	CA	UNITED STATES	Gerald R.

While the initial steps of\nthe metastatic cascade are rather well defined, identification of targets to block this process remains a major\nclinical challenge. Previous studies have elegantly investigated the mechanistic contribution of tumor cell intrinsic\nproperties that promote metastasis in bladder urothelial carcinomas. However, the functional significance of the\ntumor microenvironment and its contribution to this complicated process is not well characterized, and therefore,\nwarrants investigation. The long-term goal of this renewal application is to continue explore how collagens—a\nmajor extracellular matrix component of the microenvironment—act as a ligand to mediate crosstalk with their\nreceptor on tumor cells to facilitate the metastatic cascade. We will investigate the downstream regulatory\nmechanisms of collagen receptor signaling in both the primary tumor and metastatic sites, and to exploit these\nregulatory processes as a revolutionizing approach to target metastases. Such innovative approaches to perturb\ncollagen-cancer crosstalk—not only at the primary tumor but also at the metastatic niche—will move the field\nforward by providing a new conception in metastatic disease management, and likely extend beyond bladder\ncarcinomas to other cancer types.

Current treatment options are of limited effectiveness;\nthus, there is a pressing need for new therapies for this disease. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the\nhistone methyltransferase DOT1L is required for the development and maintenance of MLL-rearranged (MLL-r)\nleukemia in model systems. Likewise, work from the previous funding cycle clearly defined a role for DOT1L\ninhibition in MLL-r leukemia through characterization of a potent, specific DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ-5676\n(pinometostat), that has remarkably selective anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on MLL-rearranged\ncells. As pinometostat has progressed through Phase I clinical trials, responses and subsequent relapses imply\nthe development of acquired resistance to the inhibitor. In this proposal, we seek to understand the biological\nunderpinnings of DOT1L inhibitor resistance and develop a novel class of small molecule DOT1L degraders to\novercome resistance. In Specific Aim 1, we seek to understand the mechanisms of resistance through detailed\nstudies of chromatin structure and gene expression following the development of acquired resistance to DOT1L\ninhibitor therapy. We will also investigate the non-enzymatic role of DOT1L in MLL-r leukemia and define\ndependencies acquired in the resistant state. In Specific Aim 2, we will lead a chemistry and chemical biology\ncampaign and develop an assay platform for the identification and optimization of the first small molecule\ndegraders of endogenous DOT1L protein. In Specific Aim 3, we will utilize our cell culture and patient-derived\nxenograft models of MLL-r leukemia to explore the impact of DOT1L degradation on gene expression and tumor\nprogression while driving hit-to-lead optimization of DOT1L degraders that can prompt clinical investigation. We\nwill also test pharmacological hypotheses regarding combinatorial drug action with DOT1L degraders in\npredictive human models of MLL-r leukemia. We expect these aims to bring new more efficacious, less toxic\ntherapies to children and adults diagnosed with this devastating disease.

We have\nnow found that leukemogenic gene expression in AML requires distinct molecular interactions between the\npioneer transcription factor MYB and its coactivator CBP. Remarkably, peptidomimetic inhibitors of MYB\ntranscriptional coactivation exhibit potent anti-leukemia activity in most molecular subtypes of AML while sparing\nhealthy cells. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that defining and blocking the molecular mechanisms of\naberrant transcriptional coactivation in AML will lead directly to improved therapies for patients. Aim 1 will define\nthe molecular mechanisms of aberrant activation of leukemic MYB transcription factor complexes that control\noncogenic gene expression. Aim 2 will pursue the preliminary evidence that peptidomimetic and targeted small\nmolecule inhibitors can be used to dismantle leukemic transcriptional complexes in vivo and develop effective\ntherapeutic strategies using accurate genetic and patient-derived preclinical mouse models. Successful\ncompletion of this project is expected to yield essential molecular mechanisms and effective therapies of aberrant\ntranscription factors and gene control in AML, thus providing essential insights into a fundamental problem that\nremains poorly understood. This should have broad and lasting significance for understanding and treating\nrefractory leukemias in particular and human cancer generally.

Uveal melanoma metastasizes in 40% of patients and upon metastasis targets\nthe liver in 90% of these cases. The most common primary malignant liver cancer worldwide is hepatocellular\ncarcinoma (HCC). The use of blind liver biopsy as a diagnostic tool for liver cancer has many limitations including\nrisks associated with the procedure and sampling bias and it cannot be performed repeatedly for longitudinal\nstudies. Improving noninvasive imaging methodology would be a significant advance in early detection of small\nprimary cancers and liver metastases for precision medicine. There is a critical need to develop MRI contrast\nagents capable of detecting primary and metastatic liver cancers earlier in their development than currently\npossible, and to provide insight into the biology of metastases through biomarkers for precision treatment. We\nhave successfully met all of the proposed aims and milestones for Phase I. The main commercial goal of Inlighta\nBiosciences is to develop novel imaging reagents for preclinical and clinical applications. Our concerted efforts\nin this Phase II application are directed towards non-invasive earlier detection of uveal melanoma liver\nmetastasis using novel protein contrast agents ProCA32 and its variant with capability to molecular imaging\nbiomarker chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), an important biomarker for cell migration and tumor metastasis. We\nwill obtain essential data required for filing IND applications for both reagents leading to clinical translation. Aim\n1 is to optimize and validate in vivo imaging capabilities of ProCA32s in tumor detection assessing in mice and\nmonkey. We will also validate CXCR4 targeting and monitor CXCR4 expression levels in liver metastasis\nmouse models. Aim 2 is to perform the safety and toxicity profiles protein contrast agents required for IND by\ndetermining serum, cell and in vivo stability, PK/PD, toxicity, and immunogenicity. Success in our\nproposed studies will have immediate clinical implications in the diagnosis of liver metastasis from various\ncancers, primary liver cancer, and other liver diseases.

project	2R44CA199826-02A1	R44CA199826	9345822	2017	Commercialization of an MRI contrast agent for differential diagnosis of prostate cancer.	Grant	Abstract\n Prostate cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and the second most cause of cancer death of\nmen in the US. Current methods to assess prostate cancer risk combine prostate specific antigen (PSA)\nscreening and random prostate biopsy. Unfortunately, this strategy fails to reveal the lesion’s location and\ndoes not accurately differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers. As a result,\nmost patients will receive unnecessary active treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in order to avoid\nunder treatment. Active treatment involves surgery or radiation, often causing long-term side effects such\nas urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel urgency. Thus, development of non-invasive and\naccurate diagnostic imaging technology to localize and differentiate high-risk prostate cancer offer a new\ntool to assist physicians in risk-stratification and decision making and to spare millions patients with low-\nrisk cancer from unnecessary aggressive treatment.\n The mission of Molecular Theranostics (fka Prostate Theranostics) is to commercialize a novel\nmolecular imaging approach that targets an oncoprotein associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal\ntransition (EMT), cancer cell stemness, angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. The oncoprotein has\na high expression in the tumor extracellular matrix of high-risk prostate cancer, low in low-grade tumor,\nnone in normal tissues. The goal of this project is to commercialize a safe and effective targeted contrast\nagent for accurate early detection, localization, and differential diagnosis of high-risk prostate cancer with\nMRI. In phase I, we have optimized and identified a lead targeted MRI contrast agent for clinical\ntranslation. All of the milestones in Phase I of the project have been achieved. The agent possesses the\nsuperior ability of robust specific contrast enhancement in high-risk prostate cancer, not in slow growing\nlow-risk tumors in animal models, and has the potential to visualize and differentiate high-risk prostate\ncancers with MRI.\n The objectives of this SBIR Phase II are to develop a lead formulation of the contrast agent, to\nperform FDA required eIND enabling studies, and to commercialize the agent for clinical imaging prostate\ncancer. The specific aims are 1) to scale up the synthesis of the targeted contrast agent and develop a\nlead product formulation for pre-clinical study and clinical trials; 2) to validate the effectiveness of the\nformulation for prostate cancer imaging on a clinical MRI scanner and to determine its minimally effective\ndose; 3) to perform eIND-enabling pharmacokinetics and safety studies in rodents. Non-invasive accurate\ndetection of prostate cancer is an unmet clinical need for prostate cancer management. Clinical trials will\nbe initiated as soon as the eIND is approved by the FDA. Successful development of our imaging\ntechnology has the potential to accurately detect, localize, and diagnose prostate cancer, replace\ninvasive prostate biopsy, and improve decision-making in clinical management of prostate cancer. It also\nhas the potential for non-invasive active surveillance of prostate cancer and timely monitoring of disease\nprogression, as well as image-guided therapy.

project	2R44CA216539-02	R44CA216539	9315636	2017	A Novel PET Probe for Use in Cancer Diagnostics	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nPositron Emission Tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that utilizes radiolabeled molecules\n(“probes”) to target and measure biological processes. Researchers can use the same probes to examine\nmicroorganisms, cells, and mice as they do in patients to visualize and characterize the biology of disease,\nmonitor its progression, and evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Over 4000+ PET probes have been developed to\nhelp answer a variety of biological questions, but only the glucose analog [18F]FDG is routinely used for\nmolecular imaging diagnostics in patient care. There is still an unmet need to develop additional probes which\ncan annotate other key aspects of cancer biochemistry, including those in which the diagnostics share\ncommon targets with drugs, to truly establish it as a key technology for realizing improved treatment and\nmonitoring in personalized medicine. The clinical translation of next generation PET probes is hampered by a\nlack of multi-site infrastructure to robustly, reliably, and cost-effectively support their supply to fulfill the initial\ndata generation required to determine safety and efficacy in humans. This is often a key issue in bridging the\n“gap” between proof-of-concept research and FDA approval; Pharma and Biotech, who face increasing\npressure to use diagnostics to develop drugs more efficiently, require significant validation studies and a\nreliable supply to realize the value of a novel PET probe to their clinical program and invest in future studies.\nThus, early clinical studies in this gap are currently relegated to single-site production, or must undergo a cost-\nand-time-prohibitive assimilation into a commercial radiopharmacy before they've been clinically vetted.\nTo facilitate a paradigm shift in the enablement of novel PET probes for the clinical trial community, a\nfundamental change in production ideology and infrastructure re-imagining is required. Creating a network of\nacademic radiochemistry cores that standardize and share synthesis, purification, formulation, and quality\ncontrol protocols through automation and cloud-based applications for clinical production serves to reduce\nbarriers to translating PET probes from the preclinical research environment to first-in-human studies, as well\nenable rapid dissemination of PET probes across multiple sites to spur and de-risk academic and industry\ncollaboration. The overall goal of this proposal is to establish and deploy a novel, low cost, scalable\napproach to the clinical translation of a next generation PET probes for cancer, starting with candidate\nprobe [18F]CFA, with potential commercialization as a predictive response biomarker for cancer\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors (i.e. CTLA-4/PD1 blockade), a pharmacodynamic biomarker for dCK\ninhibitors, and a predictive response biomarker for chemotherapy nucleoside prodrugs.

The study was designed to take advantage of the ethnic and cultural diversity of the two geographic\nareas, as well as the expertise of the investigators in nutrition, ethnic/racial studies, and genetics. It is the most\nethnically diverse cancer cohort in existence. It achieves high cost-efficiency by supplementing active follow-up\ninformation with computerized linkages to SEER, vital statistics, hospital-discharge diagnoses, medical claim\ndata, electronic medical records and geospatial information. At baseline, the cohort included information on\n215,000 men and women, comprised almost entirely of five ethnic/racial populations: Caucasians, Japanese\nAmericans, Native Hawaiians, African Americans, and Latinos. The resource was later expanded to include a\nprospective biorepository of blood and urine specimens from ~70,000 of the participants. Leadership of the\nMEC entails a highly interactive, team approach; and the investigators have amply demonstrated their\nwillingness to share data/samples, and to participate actively in consortia. This application describes our aims\nover the next 5 years for maintaining and enhancing the infrastructure of the MEC, as well as plans for\nmethodological research. Research accomplishments include significant contributions to understanding both\ngenetic and environmental risk factors for cancer. Over 280 papers describing our findings have been\npublished during the current grant cycle. In addition, over the last 20 years, 98 research grants have been built\naround the MEC, and more than 75 students and postdoctoral fellows have been trained on the study.

project	2U24CA180803-06	U24CA180803	9627002	2019	Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) Group	Grant	The primary objective of the Imaging and Radiation Oncology (IROC) Group is to\nprovide scientific and technical expertise for incorporation of appropriate, integrated\nquality Assurance (QA) and image data management for both imaging and radiotherapy\n(RT) in applicable trials conducted by the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN)\nProgram and other NCI funded clinical trial groups (NCORP and ETCTN). The physical\nIROC QA Centers are distributed in 4 main locations and are administratively organized\nthrough the American College of Radiology (ACR). The QA Centers include IROC\nHouston, IROC Ohio, IROC Rhode Island, and IROC Philadelphia. The Advanced\nTechnology QA Center (ATC) located at Washington University, St. Louis will provide\ntheir expertise and consultation services to IROC as needed. IROC capitalizes on\nexisting infrastructure and expertise at QA centers currently providing services to the\nNCI’s clinical trial programs. Work flows, processes and information systems have been\nenhanced taking into account the best practices and standards in an integrated vision\nacross NCI’s clinical trials. The interdependencies between imaging and RT are\nsynergized eliminating duplication of services and optimizing efficient and effective\nworkflows. A major strength of IROC is the development of consistent standard\noperating procedures for all imaging and RT aspects of the NCTN, NCORP and ETCTN\n(NCI Groups) and to facilitate a seamless flow of imaging and RT patient case datasets\nacross the networks. IROC’s organizational structure allows the delivery of a broad array\nof imaging and RT QA services including Site Qualification; Trial Design Support;\nCredentialing; Data Management (Pre- and Post-treatment Case Review); and Case\nReview. An information technology infrastructure is used that harmonizes IROC\nservices, data collection, assessment and management for the NCI Groups’ clinical\ntrials. IROC implements programs that assure consistent high quality imaging and RT\nplanning/delivery across the NCTN participating sites. IROC members collaborate with\nthe NCI, NCI Groups, and disease/modality committees within each Network Group to\nprovide an optimum and effective imaging and RT core service. The IROC Group will\nanalyze QA data obtained prospectively/retrospectively and the correlation it might have\nwith clinical trial outcomes to better determine and prioritize appropriate QA activities\nthat maximize their benefit to clinical trials.

project	2U24CA180996-07	U24CA180996	9722332	2019	Cancer Genomics: Integrative and Salable Solutions in R/Bioconductor	Grant	Abstract\nBioconductor is an ecosystem of more than 1,500 open-source software and data packages for the statistical\nanalysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is widely used by the cancer genomics\nresearch community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core\ndata classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and\nefficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell\nassays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of\nDNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a\nsingle specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the\ndata. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to\nmeet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of\nsingle-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant\nprioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of\nexperimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create\nprovenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in\nprioritization. Third, we develop scalable infrastructure for the curation, distribution, maintenance,\ndiscoverability, and usability of cancer data resources within and externally to Bioconductor. Finally, we\ndevelop a program of user training and new outreach approaches to support adoption of advanced\nBioconductor infrastructure by developers of new cancer-related packages and existing packages critical to the\ncancer research community.

Since\n2007, a sea change has occurred in the field of cancer immunotherapy, resulting from the success of anti-PD1\nand anti-PD-L1. However, most of the priority agents identified in the NCI Workshop are still not broadly\navailable for academic IITs.\nSince the original award in 2011, the CITN focused on testing these high-priority agents, including 5 of the top\n8 ranked agents that hit targets critical for optimal immune responses. CITN trials are among the few academic\nIITs of these agents, and each trial has defined biologic and therapeutic principles. Two trials have led to\nchanges in clinical practice. The abbreviated Specific Aims for the CITN are as follows:\nAim 1: (a) to continue to conduct innovative early phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for adult cancers\nusing high-priority immunomodulatory agents; (b) to form a Pediatric CITN (PedCITN) to conduct innovative\nearly phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for pediatric cancers using high-priority immunomodulatory\nagents; (c) to provide leadership, infrastructure, and statistical support for the conduct of these clinical trials;\n(d) to continue to access high-priority agents central to immune responses and not broadly available for IITs\nAim 2: to coordinate studies with Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) and other labs for\nspecimen analysis (immune monitoring, biomarker credentialing) of adult and pediatric patients on CITN trials\nScientific Goals of the CITN\n1. Continue trials with T cell and natural killer cell activator and growth factor IL-15, homeostatic T cell growth\n factor IL-7, dendritic cell activator anti-CD40, dendritic cell growth factor Flt3L, and IDO inhibitor ± anti-PD1\n2. Continue trials with anti-PD1 for orphan and ultra-orphan indications, including pediatric cancers\n3. Conduct biopsy-intense trials to identify actionable causes of anti-PD1 failure and linked to therapeutic\n administration of potential rescue agents\n4. Conduct trials to assess therapies that eliminate or activate the myeloid, monocytes/macrophage, and/or\n myeloid-derived suppressor cells that reside within most cancers\n5. Conduct multicenter Phase I and early Phase II immunotherapy trials for pediatric patients with cancer\nThe results will inform future trial designs and improve the understanding of these high-priority agents. CITN\ntrials are designed to identify paths to regulatory approval and will likely change standard practice or spur\nconfirmatory pivotal trials by NCI cooperative groups and industry for adult and pediatric cancers.

project	4R42CA228875-02	R42CA228875	9991023	2019	Targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells with custom-designed viral vectors	Grant	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of adult brain cancers with a median survival of <15 months\ndespite aggressive standard chemoradiation. GBM are formed by GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) - a major\ncontributor to tumor recurrence and a natural focus for therapeutic development. There are two main reasons\nresponsible for treatment failure: 1) high intra- and inter-tumor cellular and molecular heterogeneity with\nmultiple subclones possessing distinct genetic determinants; 2) GSCs exhibit multiple redundant signaling\npathways requiring simultaneous targeting of overlapping pathways. We have invented and biologically\nvalidated a novel tandem computational platform, GeneRep-nSCORE that integrates large-scale gene\nexpression profiles with genomic changes to identify common founding alterations or master regulators of\nGSCs that span a large number, if not all, GSC subclones within and across GBM tumors. We discovered such\na core set of four common master regulators in GCSs that are outstanding targets for clinical development.\nExpression of these four factors was sufficient to reprogram normal astrocytes to GSCs, whereas their\ndepletion profoundly abrogated GSCs, and thus tumor development in vivo, in all eight lines of patient-derived\nGSCs of varied genetic and molecular backgrounds examined to date.\nThe goal of this application is to develop a customized set of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based genetic\ntools to target the whole spectrum of GSCs (Phase I) for the purpose of delivering targeting constructs to\ndeplete the four common master regulators responsible for malignant transformation and proliferation in GSCs\n(Phase II). The specific objectives of this proposal are: (i) using directed evolution and available combinatorial\nAAV capsid library, and for the first time, introducing a dynamic mode of administration of a library reagent\nover the time course of tumor progression, to greatly increase the probability of identifying novel AAV variants\nspecifically targeting slow-, and fast-cycling GSCs in patient-derived xenograft models (PDX) (Phase I); (ii) To\ndesign and validate a panel of AAV vectors that express shRNAs targeting core master regulators of GSCs to\nidentify leads for preclinical testing; (iii) To optimize modes of viral delivery, pharmacokinetics and\npharmacodynamics parameters, and safety and toxicity in normal and PDX treated with lead targeting AAV\ncassettes; and (iv) Based on these results, tools and basic DMPK data created, to conduct preclinical efficacy\nstudies in PDX treated with lead targeting AAV cassettes either alone or in combination with standard\nchemoradiotherapy (Phase II) to prepare for an investigative new drug application for clinical testing in patients\nwith GBM, and for commercial development of this novel technology.

project	4R44CA217528-02	R44CA217528	9777221	2018	Novel Fluorescent Diagnostic Agents for Detection, Staging, andIntraoperative Imaging of Tumors	Grant	Abstract\nThe goal of this project is to develop IV injectable fluorescent agents for use in intraoperative\nimaging of peritoneal metastatic tumors. Significance: Peritoneal metastatic cancers have an\nincidence of 250,000/per year in the US and are primarily treated with surgery. Complete surgical\ntumor resection is a gold-standard treatment goal that can increase the 5-year patient survival to\n50%, whereas incomplete tumor resection (<2mm) could drastically reduce the survival to a mere\nfew months. Current clinical imaging technologies such as PET, MRI and CT have limitations for\nguiding cancer surgery including inability to be used intraoperatively due to safety associated with\nionizing radiation, as well as limitations on sensitivity and tumor specificity especially for lesions\nsmaller than 10mm. Conventional fluorescent molecular probes in development typically target\ntumor proteins and are limited in imaging the heterogeneous onco-geno-phenotypes of peritoneal\nmetastasis that have multiple tissues of origin and vary in protein expression levels. In order to\nreduce incomplete tumor resection and improve survival, there is an urgent need for clear visual\ncontrast imaging agents that enable more precise and specific detection of peritoneal metastasis\ntumors intraoperatively and in real-time. Hypothesis: OncoNano’s approach of targeting tumor\nacidosis which is ubiquitously expressed as a cancer biomarker across tumors, coupled with\nOncoNano’s ultra-sensitive pH fluorescent digital sensors, provides a broad based approach to\nimage the heterogeneous peritoneal metastasis with high specificity and sensitivity. Preliminary\nData: We have demonstrated that OncoNano’s fluorescent agents image tumors across a variety\nof solid tumor types (14 tested to date), including peritoneal metastasis to submillimeter precision\nin SCID mouse models. OncoNano’s agents provided a digital (ON-OFF) response which offered\nclear tumor delineation, and lower detection limits (>10x) compared with state of the art PET-FDG\nimaging. Surgical tumor resection using OncoNano imaging agent showed significant (40-50%)\nsurvival benefit in SCID mouse models compared with conventional white light based surgery.\nSpecific Aims: The scientific aims of this project will enable OncoNano to clinically translate, the\nultrasensitive pH probes and develop it from the lab bench through to establishing reproducible\nmanufacturing of a stable formulation, to establishing safety and pharmacology, for an FDA IND\nfiling. The specific aims in the SBIR Phase I, addresses the nanoprobe stability requirement, and\naddresses the nanoprobe sensitivity and specificity requirement in in-vivo models. The specific\naims in Phase 2 of the project addresses the critical milestones on the path to clinical translation\nincluding- the scale-up requirement to meet the GLP and human testing needs, a demonstration\nof product safety in GLP in-vivo studies, culminating in an IND filing with the FDA.

project	4U01CA224145-02	U01CA224145	10242453	2020	Interrupting Cellular Crosstalk in the Immunosuppressive Microenvironment of Pancreas Cancer	Grant	Abstract\nImmune therapy has shown great promise in the treatment of a number of malignancies, but\nhas not proven fruitful in fighting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) using current\nmodalities. One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in\nestablishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication\nbetween cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and\ntumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize\nmacrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific\nmetabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making\nArginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer\ncells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of\nmatched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of\ncancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie “microtumors”) and a unique dual recombinase\ngenetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with\ninhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition,\novercoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer\nmicroenvironment.

project	4U01CA224146-02	U01CA224146	10242454	2020	Systematic interrogation of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment in patient-derived specimens	Grant	Abstract\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 8%. Despite\nsuccess in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC\ndemonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly\nunderstood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an\nimproved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will\nenable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future\nimmunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in\nPDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that\ntarget tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this\nproject, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic\nPDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will\nutilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at\nunprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy,\nradiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these\nstudies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional\nevaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3\nwe will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to\ninvestigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and\nimprove immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in\nPDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME\nand identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating\ndisease.

project	4U01CA224151-02	U01CA224151	10247895	2020	Canine Immuno Neurotherapeutics	Grant	ABSTRACT:\nThe dog is an ideal large animal model for diagnostic and therapeutic studies and can be used to translate\nsuccesses to human patients while providing compassionate care to animals and advancing the field of\nveterinary medicine. Pet dogs share their environment, and oftentimes their diet, with their owners. Dogs and\nhumans develop sporadic benign and malignant brain tumors at about the same rate and with similar\nhistopathology. Dogs are often euthanized due to the cost of care. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine\nbrain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people as well as pets through comparative\noncology and genomics and the “One Medicine” approach to research and direct clinical application. We propose\na multi-institutional consortium to test an innovative combinatorial immunotherapeutic approach in dogs that\nspontaneously and sporadically develop malignant glial brain tumors that resemble in most important aspects,\nhigh-grade malignant gliomas in humans. Our approach will inject a clinical grade oncolytic herpes simplex virus\n(HSV) M032 that expresses human interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the resected tumor bed. Dog lymphocytes fully\nrespond to human IL-12 [1] and oncolytic HSV infect and kill canine (as well as mouse, non-human primate,\nhuman) tumor cells, creating a potent local inflammatory response and an antigen-rich tumor cell debris field.\nTherefore, we would anticipate that this virally-based immunotherapeutic approach would likely be as effective\nin dogs with brain tumors as in humans with brain tumors. We will conduct longitudinal safety, survival and\ncorrelative biology evaluations as a means of assessing the dog as an appropriate and informative model for\ndesign and implementation of clinical studies in humans with high-grade malignant brain tumors. To extend these\nfindings, we propose, in subsequent studies, to combine the HSV immunotherapy approach with molecules that\nblock the action of innate checkpoint inhibitor(s). These studies are designed to address key issues of safety\nand efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy in the dog that can be translated to humans with malignant gliomas.\nMalignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in humans, accounting for 30% of all primary\ncentral nervous system (CNS) tumors in adults. [2] With few major advances in decades, there has been no\nsignificant reduction in mortality and only a modest improvement in median survival. Recently, objective\nresponses and long-term survivals have been observed in human glioma patients who have received oncolytic\nvirotherapy and a Phase I trial is currently underway at UAB in patients using M032 alone. New approaches to\nutilize checkpoint inhibitors promises improved efficacy, but the ability to develop more effective combinatorial\napproaches has been slow, in large part due to lack of a faithful model of spontaneous glioblastoma multiforme\n(GBM) in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal\nopportunity to improve the lives of people and pets through comparative oncology and genomics using the “One\nMedicine“ approach to research and direct clinical application.

Despite this progress, up to 40% of patients will ultimately succumb to their\ndisease. Furthermore, even when treatment is successful, cytotoxic chemotherapy carries a high risk of long-\nterm morbidities that impact quality of life. The recent success of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint\ninhibitors in the setting of lymphoma demonstrates the potential for additional progress in long-term disease\ncontrol of DLBCL, with less toxicity. The molecular and genetic phenotype of canine DLBCL has been studied\nand it often resembles the activated B cell (ABC) category typically associated with aggressive DLBCL in people.\nMoreover, there is now substantial data that specific genetic changes and pathway aberrations are conserved\nacross dogs and people with DLBCL supporting the notion that the canine disease can be used as a relevant\nspontaneous large animal model of the human counterpart. Toward this end, the purpose of this proposal is to\nuse dogs with spontaneous naïve DLBCL to rapidly evaluate rational small molecule/immunotherapy\ncombination approaches, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most effective combination to move forward in\nhuman patients with DLBCL. Specifically, we hypothesize that optimal combinations of anti-CD20, anti-\nPD1, XPO1 inhibition, NAMPT/PAK4 and PI3Kdelta inhibition will have better outcomes than doxorubicin\nbased chemotherapy, resulting in a “chemo-free” blueprint for future human trials. Using an adaptive\nmini-pilot trial approach, those combinations deemed antagonistic and/or associated with unacceptable adverse\nevents can be rapidly removed from consideration, while those with clear therapeutic promise can be most\neffectively studied in the front-line setting and enhanced. We will accomplish this by first determining the optimal\nchemo-free regimen with small molecule/ anti-CD20 combinations, then identifying the optimal chemo-free\nregimen with small molecule/anti-PD1 combinations and finally, by evaluating a frontline chemo-free novel\ncombination regimen in canine DLBCL to demonstrate superiority to standard R-CHOP-based chemotherapy.\nAdditionally, we will interrogate correlative biomarkers based on RNA sequencing of tumor samples obtained\nfrom dogs enrolled into the prospective trials and develop signatures that can be used to predict not only\nresponse to therapy, but more importantly long-term progression-free survival. Together, the data generated\nfrom this proposal will create a framework for effectively leveraging information gained from integrated\nimmunotherapeutic trials in canine patients with DLBCL to develop chemo-free strategies that ultimately improve\nhuman outcomes.

In the field of immunotherapy, dogs offer an innovative model for translational research, as they\npresent many of the challenges faced in “scaling up” therapeutic systems dependent on complex interactions\nbetween multiple cell types yet under more controlled settings. They also allow for long-term assessment of\nefficacy and toxicities. Canine clinical trials offer unique access to a rich source of spontaneously occurring,\ngenetically and immunologically diverse cancers with the benefits of reduced time, expense, and regulatory\nhurdles of a human trial. The similarities between canine and human cancers are increasingly being realized.\nThe publicly available canine genome has propelled comparative genomics studies that have shown significant\nhomology between dogs and humans for recognized cancer-associated genes including MET, IGF1R, mTOR,\nand KIT. Not surprisingly, cytogenetic abnormalities that define human cancers, i.e. BCR-Abl translocations in\nchronic myelogenous leukemia and RB1 deletions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been found in\ncomparable canine cancers. Intracranial neoplasia occurs frequently in dogs with a reported prevalence from\n0.15 to 4.5% compared to 18.2 cases per 100,000 human. Astrocytoma or glioma account for 20-36% of\nprimary brain tumors in dogs and 25% in humans. Brachycephalic breeds such as Boxers, French and English\nbulldogs, and Boston terriers have a significantly increased risk of developing gliomas. Primary canine brain\ntumors have similar histologic classification as those reported by the World Health Organization for human\nbrain tumors. Similar to that in humans, the prognosis for dogs with brain tumors in general is poor regardless\nof therapeutic intervention. However, much less is known about canine glioma treatment outcomes because\nonly a small number of studies with few dogs have been reported. There is little information about median\nsurvival time for dogs with glioma that received any type of treatment, but estimates of days to 2 or 3 months\nare often given to owners. The clinical similarities between dogs and humans suggest that dogs may represent\nan outstanding model for testing targeted therapies; both dogs and humans might benefit from these studies.\nHerein, we are proposing a multi-pronged immunotherapeutic approach to improve efficacy and survival times.\nWe hypothesize that combination immunotherapy in a canine glioma model will enhance efficacy and\naccelerate successful translation into phase I human trials for GBM. The objective is to use pet dogs with\nspontaneous GBM to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of combination immunotherapy. We propose two\nSpecific Aims: 1. Determine the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in spontaneous\ncanine GBM in combination with standard of care, and 2. Assess the efficacy of immune-mediated gene\ntherapy in combination with CD200 blockade to enhance anti-glioma immunotherapy.

This work is targeted to dogs with typically lethal, naturally occurring osteosarcoma (OSA)\nand melanoma, and the findings are expected to have important relevance for the design and translation of\ninnovative immunotherapy approaches in humans. Inhaled (IH) IL-15 offers the advantages of local delivery of\nthis immune-stimulatory cytokine, while limiting systemic exposure and thus potential toxicity. Super-agonist IL-\n15 offers increased half-life and greater anti-tumor effects. Therefore, each of these cytokines is anticipated to\nalter the risk/benefit ratio in favor of their use. To accomplish these objectives, we propose the following three\nspecific aims: 1) Targeting gross pulmonary metastases (OSA and melanoma) with first-in-dog delivery of\ninhaled (IH) human IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15; 2) Phase II trial of IH IL-15 and autologous NK cells to treat\ngross OSA and melanoma pulmonary metastases, and; 3) Targeting micro-metastatic disease using super-\nagonist IL-15 in primary OSA. The canine model represents a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy research\nas an important link between murine models and human clinical studies. Dogs represent an attractive outbred\ncombination of companion animals that experience spontaneous cancer development in the setting of an intact\nimmune system. Importantly, these studies are designed to evaluate novel treatment combinations for\nadvanced pulmonary metastases in the setting of gross disease, but also will determine the impact of this\napproach as first-line therapy when combined with standard-of-care treatments. Moreover, this work seeks to\nelucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate an anti-tumor response (or non-response) in\ndogs with naturally occurring cancers. We will have the unique opportunity to perform whole exome\nsequencing and RNASeq on tumor tissue pre- and post-immunotherapy, and we will investigate whether a\nsignature of mutational landscape and gene expression profiles can be developed to prospectively predict\noutcome and response to immune therapies. We will correlate these data to immunohistochemical, flow\ncytometry, and serum cytokine readouts for evidence of transition from “cold” to “hot” tumors predictive of\nfavorable long term outcome. Hence, these canine trials and bio-marker studies represent an ideal strategy to\ninform and facilitate the rapid translation of novel, potentially high impact immune therapies to human patients\nwith aggressive cancers.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic\nresponse, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to\npresumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking.\n3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme\noutcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular\nimmunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term\nsurvivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and\nthat long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this\nproposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment-\nspecific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can\nneoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue\nand blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy.\nThe proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies – a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to\nidentify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific\nmodulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic\nPDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating\nexosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation\nsequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen\ndiscovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of\nneoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of\nhighly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill\nCornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute\nfor Advanced Study. This initiative is directly relevant to the primary objective to develop novel biomarkers and\nT cell antigenic targets for the successful application of immunotherapy in PDAC.

Indeed, canine OS has historically been used to help develop\nnovel limb spare techniques, evaluate a variety of non-specific immunotherapeutics such as L-MTP-PE, and\nassess the efficacy of targeted therapeutics to prevent the outgrowth of metastatic disease. Despite best efforts,\nprogress in the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease has essentially stalled for the past 3 decades;\n30% of people and 90% of dogs still die of tumor spread, primarily to the lungs. Numerous clinical trials have\nbeen undertaken in people with macroscopic metastases and in dogs with both microscopic and macroscopic\ndisease, yet all have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes. This is particularly evident with respect to\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors that do not induce the dramatic disease regressions typically observed in other\ncancers such as melanoma and lung cancer. One particularly daunting challenge for immunotherapy-based\ntherapeutics in OS relates to the permissiveness of the tumor microenvironment (TME) for inducing anti-tumor\nimmune responses. Our data suggests that a relatively low mutational load combined with a dampened overall\nimmune response in OS may contribute to the observed lack of response to current treatment approaches. We\npropose that targeting the immune suppressive TME in OS is essential to generating potent and durable anti-\ntumor immunity. To accomplish this, it may be necessary to simultaneously modulate several elements in the\nTME, including Tregs, MDSCs, M2 macrophages and overexpressed inhibitory checkpoint molecules. In support\nof this, we have generated a body of data demonstrating immunological activity of multiple therapeutics, including\nrepurposed drugs with good safety records (losartan, oclacitinib), small molecule inhibitors with established\nPK/PD in dogs (toceranib, RV1001, reparixin, JHU-292) and antibodies specific for checkpoint molecules (anti-\nPD1). However, the exact combinations that are most effective against metastatic OS have not yet been\nidentified, and this is a major goal of this proposal. As such, we hypothesize that an adaptive pilot trial design\ncan be used to rapidly screen TME-targeting immunotherapy drug combinations in dogs with\nmacroscopic chemotherapy-resistant metastatic OS and that this information can be refined to assess\nactivity of the most active approach against microscopic metastases in a subsequent adjuvant trial. This\nwill be accomplished by testing four TME modifying immunotherapy combinations for anti-tumor and immune\nmodulatory activity in dogs with macroscopic OS metastases, interrogating relevant biomarkers associated with\nresponses to therapy, then using this information to conduct an adjuvant immunotherapy trial with the most active\ncombination in dogs with microscopic metastatic OS. The data generated from this proposal will create a\nblueprint for future immunotherapy studies in people with OS by eliminating approaches deemed inactive\nand generating a set of clinical biomarkers to guide treatment.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this\ncomplex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the\nprohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water,\ndense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and\npro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this\nproject has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several\nhighly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and\ninteractions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote\nthe survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that\nsignificantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also\nthe three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In\nthe following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and\nmyeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will\npursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and\nmitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic\nallografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).

project	4U01CA224348-02	U01CA224348	10242459	2020	Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy	Grant	We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n(PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan,\ncan enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS\n2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include “normalization” of cancer-associated\nfibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and\ndecreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at\nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy – FOLFIRINOX and\nthen chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this\ntrial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to\nresectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably,\ntranscriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only\nnormalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity\ninvolving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the\nPDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in\ncombination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive\nPDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs\nand cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had\nlimited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover\nhow losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood\nvessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug-\ninduced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically\nengineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment\nreprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on\nour preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our\nbench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will\npositively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have\na 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the\nknowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment\nin PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium. Through this work, we will develop innovative\napproaches to enhance anti-tumor immunity in this intractable disease.

project	4U24CA224020-02	U24CA224020	10242451	2020	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC)	Grant	ABSTRACT\nIn contrast to the decline in mortality in other cancers, the incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n(PDAC) is increasing, and therapeutic approaches, for the most part, have not been successful at improving\nsurvival in patients. Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers,\ncomparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an\nimmune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune\nbarriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease.\nThe U01 “Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME” was created through the National Cancer\nMoonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC,\nespecially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24\nRFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal\nAdenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio\nWistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center\n(UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with\nrespect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental\ntherapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics),\nAndy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton\n(co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple\nareas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01\nawardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage\ncapabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing\ntranslationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support\nadministrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and\naccess to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will\nserve as the central “hub” for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we\nwill utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be\nreadily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics\nservices for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and\ndevelop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well\nas provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be\nan indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.

project	4U24CA224067-02	U24CA224067	9985279	2019	Data Coordination Center for PDX Net	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nPatient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are a powerful model system for assessing drug efficacy of anti-cancer\nagents and understanding molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. However, results from individual\nresearch groups have been difficult to validate due to the lack of standardized PDX procedures, lack of scale\nfor adequately powered PDX studies and the inability to efficiently share PDX specimens. A key contributor to\nthis challenge is the lack of well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of\nintegrated, standardized datasets from PDX models. The JAX-Seven Bridges PDX Data Commons and\nCoordination Center (PDCCC) seeks to address this challenge and unite the efforts of the component data-\ngenerating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI’s Patient-Derived\nModel Repository/PDMR) parts of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research Network (PDXNet) into\na cohesive, trans-Network whole. Using innovative cloud computing and bioinformatic approaches, our\nPDCCC will provide administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX method\nstandardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. We will build a data storage,\nsharing, and analysis platform that harmonizes PDXNet data with other large datasets and analysis workflows\navailable in the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud. Simultaneously, we will administer planning meetings, training\nactivities, and research pilots to build synergies within the PDXNet, enhancing the ability of the PDXNet to\ndevelop clinical trials from PDX studies. Our Specific Aims are to 1) establish a leadership and\nadministration unit to manage and coordinate activities within PDXNet, including annual meetings,\nregular conference calls, training activities, trans-Network pilot projects, and outreach; 2) develop a cloud-\nintegrated PDXnet Data Commons that integrates PDXNet data with the existing cloud-based data analysis\nplatform - the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC); and 3) build analysis workflows and data\nsharing practices to optimize PDXNet research and enable PDXNet data to facilitate clinical trial design. To\naccomplish these Aims we have assembled a team with unique expertise in PDXs, cancer treatment, genomic\nanalysis, data coordination, and project management from The Jackson Laboratory and Seven Bridges. Our\ncombined institutional strengths include a history of leadership in (and commitment) to PDX, data resource,\nanalytic and consensus standards development and application; practical expertise in PDX model sharing and\ncollaborative community efforts; a broad array of statistical, bioinformatic, and software-related PDX resources;\nleadership expertise in large-scale, cloud-based biomedical data projects, notably the SB-CGC; and deep\nexperience in high-performance database engineering and development. Our goal is to build an innovative,\nsystematically organized PDCCC that will advance the efforts of PDXNet to improve the validity—and expand\nuse—of the PDX system as a preclinical platform for precision oncology.

project	4U24CA224122-02	U24CA224122	10247892	2020	Coordinating Center for Canine Immunotherapy Trials and Correlative Studies	Grant	The primary mission of goal of the Pre-medical Cancer Immunotherapy Network for Canine Trials (PRECINCT) is to facilitate the performance of immunotherapy clinical trials in dogs with cancer and to expedite the identification of\nimmunological correlates of successful therapeutic responses. The PRECINCT will achieve these goal by supporting a highly coordinated clinical trials network of participating U01 sites. As a coordinating center, the PRECINCT will work in consultation with U01 investigators, the Steering Committee, representatives from the Comparative Oncology Program (COP) at NCI and an External Advisory Committee to provide expert services in project management and research technology, data management, biostatistical support and immunological monitoring.\nSpecifically, we will establish a PRECINCT Data Coordinating Center to provide comprehensive project oversight,\nsupervise all project management and regulatory compliance activities, and coordinate site management for all\naspects of single and large multi-site projects. Through the PRECINCT, U01 investigators will have ready access to research services and standardized protocols that will facilitate the performance of clinical research across the\nPRECINCT. We will establish a PRECINCT Data Management System to collect, store and share all clinical and\ncorrelative data amongst the U01 sites and with the COP directors and Steering Committee. We will develop the\ninfrastructure necessary to achieve an efficient, highly functioning coordinated network and develop standard\noperating procedures (SOPs) that can be applied across all PRECINCT-associated U01 projects to ensure high\nquality, repeatable data sets. We will provide biostatistical support for study design and data analysis to ensure\nthat immunotherapy clinical trials performed within the network are strategically designed and appropriately\npowered to achieve meaningful clinical and laboratory data results in the most expedite way. The renowned\nexpertise of the University of Pennsylvania in both human and canine clinical trials will foster rapid translation of\nstate-of-the art methods for human clinical study design and analysis to canine clinical trials and results from\ncanine trials can rapidly inform human clinical trials, thus optimizing results for both species. Finally, the University\nof Pennsylvania is a leader in cancer immunotherapy and is also home to world renowned experts in immune\nreagent development and immunological monitoring. We will leverage this expertise to both accelerate the\nmission of the U24 and extend it by providing support for immunologic reagent development for use in correlative\nstudies and biomarker identification. In concert with U01 investigators, the COP and the Steering Committee, we\nwill design, generate and validate several multiparametric, multicolor flow panels and SOPs for their use across the\nU01 sites. Successful immunologic monitoring will allow canine cancer patients to be streamlined to single or\ncombination therapies most likely to be effective and will provide essential insight for future translational\napplication to human cancer patients.

project	4U54CA224018-02	U54CA224018	9985240	2019	Overcoming Drug Resistance in Multiple Myeloma	Grant	OVERALL ABSTRACT\nMM is a plasma cell neoplasm within the bone marrow with significant complexity and\nheterogeneity at the molecular level. Despite improvements in the clinical outcomes\nachieved with newer therapies, wide inter-individual variation in response to treatment is\na major limitation in achieving consistent therapeutic effects, or cures. Not all patients\nrespond to initial therapies (innate resistance), and those that do frequently relapse with\nrefractory disease (acquired resistance). The central hypothesis we are addressing is\nthat rational therapeutic development in MM should be based on an understanding of the\nunderlying genetics and biology of the tumor that identify sensitivity and resistance to\ncurrent and future drugs. In this Myeloma-DRSC we are proposing 3 Projects that will:\n1) develop a high throughput drug screening platform for myeloma cell lines representing\nthe wide diversity of MM biology; and use this platform to screen primary patient tumor\ncells for most effective responses, including combination therapies; 2) develop a\ncomprehensive mutational and germline variation panel that will be correlated to drug\nresponses in vitro and in vivo, as well as toxicities; 3) identify the mechanism of\nresponse and resistance for two of the most common therapeutics used in MM\ntreatment: IMiDS and proteasome inhibitors; 4) develop genetic and immunophenotypic\nsignatures that effectively predict tumor response, resistance, and patient toxicities; 5)\nidentify tumor sub-populations that may contribute to emerging resistance; and 6)\nidentify strategies to predict drug resistance and approaches to overcome resistance.

project	4U54CA224019-02	U54CA224019	9985229	2019	Tumor Intrinsic and Microenvironmental Mechanisms Driving Drug Combination Efficacy and Resistance in AML	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common hematologic malignancies, representing a diverse\ncollection of complex diseases. Treatment strategies for AML have not changed in 30-40 years. Single-agent\ntargeted therapies based on AML genetics or microenvironmental disease features have been disappointing, at\nbest. The investigators on this DRSC Program, Drug Combinations to Circumvent Resistance (D2CR), have\ncollaborated for over a decade and have developed functional genomic pipelines for evaluation of primary AML\npatient samples that have collectively led to numerous discoveries with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.\nFor this Program, our long-term goals are to translate effective drug combinations that target tumor-\nintrinsic and microenvironmental pathways into the clinic for patients with AML. Our immediate goals\nare to prioritize the most relevant tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways for each AML\ndisease subset and establish sufficient preclinical data to facilitate immediate clinical investigation of\ndrug combinations. Based on the central hypothesis that drug combinations targeting tumor intrinsic\nand extrinsic features of AML biology will be essential to the development of more effective and\ndurable therapeutic strategies, we predict that the drug combinations established by this D2CR-DRSC\nProgram will substantially improve outcomes for patients with AML. To accomplish these goals, 3\nProjects are proposed: 1) What are the tumor-intrinsic genes and pathways that contribute to drug sensitivity\nand resistance? Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screens on parental and drug-resistant AML cells will be\nintegrated with computational analysis of the largest functional genomic AML cohort in the world. The result will\nnominate genes/pathways for validation on patient samples in gene-edited models and for drug combination\nstudies in Project 3. 2) What are the tumor-extrinsic pathways promoting tumor cell growth, drug resistance,\nand immune suppression? Inflammatory cytokine profiling of our large bank of AML patient samples will be\nconducted. Our bank of AML patient bone marrow stromal cells will also be accessed for studies of the reactive\nsignature of these stromal cells when exposed to specific drugs. Finally, high-parameter immunophenotyping\nand T-cell functional assays will be used to define the immune landscape with candidate drugs tested in an\nimmune-competent, spontaneous mouse model of AML. Candidate targets will be nominated for combination\nstudies with tumor-intrinsic targets. 3) What are the drug combinations that most effectively bridge tumor-\nintrinsic and microenvironmental biology to eliminate AML cells and circumvent resistance? Drug combinations\nfrom targets nominated in Project 1 and 2 will be tested ex vivo on primary AML patient samples and in vivo\nusing AML patient-derived xenografts. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a major\nimpact on our understanding of AML biology, with successful clinical translation of new, more effective drug\ncombination strategies.

project	4U54CA224065-02	U54CA224065	9985264	2019	University of Texas PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	SUMMARY\nOur overarching goal for the University Texas PDX Development and Trial Center (UTPDTC) is to optimize\npersonalized biomarker-based cancer therapy and identify effective targeted drugs based on the molecular\ncharacteristics of each tumor. Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly-\nannotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The\nprimary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single\nagents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs\nor combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets\nof tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused\non non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative\nbreast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other\nhistologies. Over the past 9 years, both University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDACC) and The University of\nUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) have established institution-wide efforts to generate\nnovel PDX models and perform preclinical testing. Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX\nmodels of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC,\nn=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases\nwhere there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We have characterized many tumor subtypes in our existing\nPDXs and plan to characterize many more with the ultimate goal of developing drug combinations in defined\ntumor subsets in a context that can lead to clinical trials which will validate the experimental results. We plan to\nfocus on NCI-IND agents that are primarily used by the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network. The\navailability of hundreds of PDXs of diverse histologic types and molecular profiles provides a unique opportunity\nfor synergistic interactions among the UTPDTC investigators, PDXNet, and ETCTN. Each Project will identify\nmolecular subtypes and then test with drugs targeted to putative pathways. Similar molecular subtype profiles\nwill be identified across projects and histologic classifications. This provides an opportunity to test the activity of\ndrugs targeting specific molecular pathways that may be active in several histologically distinct subtypes. Such\npan-histologic activity could greatly accelerate drug development. Our proposed studies focus on targeted\ntherapeutic agents for treatment of diseases and/or molecular subtypes that have unmet medical needs. The\nproposed studies are highly relevant to public health, as their success will lead to effective precision therapy for\ncancers, for which current therapies are ineffective.

project	4U54CA224068-02	U54CA224068	9985249	2019	An integrated translational approach to overcome drug resistance	Grant	Drug resistance represents one of the most critical obstacles to clinical benefit for cancer patients. Due to the\nsize and complexity of this challenge, we believe a collaborative team approach is critical and have assembled\na team of drug resistance experts from three leading institutions (MGH, the Broad Institute, and MIT/Koch\nInstitute) with an exceptional track record of impactful discoveries in this field. We propose an integrated full-spectrum\ntranslational platform—including liquid biopsy, patient-derived tumor models, exome and\ntranscriptome sequencing of tumor tissue, rapid autopsy, functional genomic screens, innovative preclinical\nmouse models, and a high-throughput combination drug-screening platform covering the CTEP portfolio—to\naddress critical principles of drug resistance across several major cancer types—lung, melanoma and GI\ncancers, which impact a large percentage of cancer patients. Overall, these three projects will focus on the\ncommon theme of bypass resistance mechanisms, a critical ad frequent mechanism of therapeutic resistance\nthat can involve both genetic and adaptive resistance mechanisms that “bypass” the effects of therapy, and\nwhich can drive both intrinsic and acquired resistance. To maximize the potential impact on cancer patients we\nwill focus projects on three major tumor types—lung, melanoma and GI cancers—with each project integrating\nat least two tumor types. We will focus our projects on defining and overcoming key bypass resistance\nmechanisms to three of the most critical classes of cancer therapeutics: MAPK inhibitors, RTK inhibitors, and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors. While each project will focus on a specific therapy and at least two specific\ncancer types, we believe the overall program design can be readily applied to additional agents and\nmolecularly-defined cancers, such that the ultimate impact of this work will go beyond the specific studies\nproposed and will serve as a “blueprint” for critical discoveries related to drug resistance. We anticipate that\nthese efforts will define a new standard in our mechanistic understanding of bypass resistance mechanisms\nand will lead to novel opportunities to overcome them in the clinic.

project	4U54CA224070-02	U54CA224070	9985257	2019	Rational approaches to melanoma therapy	Grant	Project Summary – Overall\nThe outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma have improved dramatically over the last decade due to an\nimproved understanding of the molecular drivers of this disease. In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens\nhave been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas.\nThese treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof-\nof-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will\nprogress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been\nshown to be effective in patients with a wild-type BRAF. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments\nthat prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are\neffective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies,\nover the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical,\nhistological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of >450 PDX models represents one of the\nlargest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately\nrecapituluates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also\nincludes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been\nmaintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a\nrobust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we\npropose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued\nexpansion of our robutst melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical\ngaps in this disease. Project 1 will characterize kinase inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the\nPI3K-AKT pathway in combination with approved targeted therapies in PDX models in treatment-naïve and drug-\nresistant BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanomas. Project 2 will characterize targeting the apoptotic machinery of cancer\ncells as a combinatorial approach with MAPK pathway inhibitors in PDX with and without BRAFV600E/K mutations,\nincluding in subsets with aberrancies in anti-apoptotic genes. Both Projects will utilize baseline characteristics of the\nPDX models to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to guide personalized patient selection for\nfuture clinical testing. In addition, tumors will be analyzed for treatment-induced effects that correlate with sensitivity\nto identified resistance mechanisms and potential new combinatorial strategies. Finally, markers identified in the\npreclinical models will be compared to parallel biomarker studies of metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in\nclinical trials utilizing the same agents. These studies will be supported by the PDX, Bioinformatics, and\nAdministrative Cores to ensure their success, along with a Pilot Project program to open new areas of investigation.\nTogether these studies will have high potential to translate into new personalized clinical trials for patients.

project	4U54CA224076-02	U54CA224076	9985272	2019	PDX Trial Center for Breast Cancer Therapy	Grant	Project Summary\nThe scientific premise of this Center is that breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models\nrepresent the diversity of human breast tumors, and can be feasibly utilized to test new drugs and drug\ncombinations to find therapeutic approaches that match with molecular features of various tumor types.\nThe goal of our PDX Development and Trials Center (PDTC) is to obtain preclinical data that will\nfacilitate prioritization of drugs to be tested in breast cancer clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute\n(NCI). Toward this goal, our PDTC focuses on testing drugs that are already available through the NCI\nas NCI-IND agents with the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). Scientifically,\nthis PDTC will focus on preclinical evaluation of approved and investigational drugs and drug\ncombinations in a large collection of breast PDX models representing primary and metastatic breast\ncancer. One project will screen 35 NCI-IND drugs as single agents and in combination with standard-\nof-care therapies, in >100 breast PDX models using a novel organoid system, and validate these\nresponses in PDX-bearing mice. Another project will test therapies that are predicted to target tumor-\ninitiating cell populations, with the goal of reducing chemotherapy resistance and recurrence – the major\ncause of death from breast cancer. These two synergistic research projects will be supported several\nkey Cores: a PDX Core to propagate the PDX models and run the drug studies; a Biostatistics and\nBioinformatics Core to identify molecular features of tumors that do (or do not) respond to various\ntreatments; a Pilot Projects and Trans-network Activities Core to foster exploration of new ideas within\nthe PDTC and in collaboration with the PDXNetwork (PDXNet); and an Administrative Core to facilitate\neffective communication within the PDTC and with the PDXNet. Taken together, these elements will\nconverge to reveal high-priority treatment strategies for future clinical trials in breast cancer patients.

project	4U54CA224079-02	U54CA224079	9985232	2019	The MSKCC-UW/Fred Hutch Prostate Cancer Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center	Grant	OVERALL ABSTRACT\nThe lethal stage of metastatic prostate cancer, called castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), kills\n~26,000 men per year in the US. Despite remarkable improvements in survival with next generation AR\npathway inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, CRPC patients ultimately progress and die from\ntheir disease. Our understanding of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to AR therapy has increased\ndramatically in recent years, largely based on genomic landscape analyses of tumors from CRPC patients and\npreclinical studies of acquired resistance in patient-derived models (organoids, PDX). Much of this progress is\ndirectly linked to the members of this Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center (DRSC) team. A major\nmechanistic insight from these studies is the recognition of two categories of AR therapy resistance: one in\nwhich AR pathway signaling is restored and the other in which it remains inhibited. Underlying both categories\nare a heterogeneous set of resistance mechanisms, many of which were discovered by our DRSC team\nmembers. Importantly, we have shown that several of these resistance mechanisms can be targeted with\ncurrent clinical grade drugs. The overarching goal of this DRSC proposal is to evaluate these translational\nopportunities across a unique set of preclinical organoid and PDX models (again, discovered and developed by\nour DRSC team members) and to catalyze the initiation of clinical studies in patients most likely to benefit\nbased on appropriate biomarker profiles. We address this goal in three Projects. Project 1 focuses on\nresistance caused by restored AR pathway function, which occurs in over ~50% of CRPC patients, by targeting\nthe glucocorticoid receptor, which is upregulated and substitutes for AR, or by further inhibition of AR signaling\nusing drugs targeting specific components of the chromatin machinery. Project 2 will take a similar approach\nbut will focus on the opposite category of acquired resistance (absence of restored AR pathway activity),\nleveraging insights from our recent data showing that cancer can revert from an AR-negative to AR-positive\nstate by targeting specific chromatin modifiers. Project 3 integrates with Projects 1 and 2 by focusing on\nkinase inhibitors as an adjunct to AR pathway therapy in two distinct contexts – PI3K/AKT activation in tumors\nwith PTEN loss and FGFR activation in tumors with autocrine FGF8/FGF9 production. Excitingly, a recent\nclinical trial of combined AKT and AR inhibition, which was initiated based on our earlier work, demonstrated a\nsignificant improvement in survival for patients with PTEN loss prostate cancer. The Administrative Core will\noversee the integration of the Projects with each other, with NCI scientific staff and with other DRSCs.\nCollectively our studies will validate various combination therapy regimens, in conjunction with molecular\nbiomarkers for patient selection, as a critical step toward clinical translation. In addition, the drugs and targets\nstudied here are broadly relevant for multiple cancer types.

project	4U54CA224081-02	U54CA224081	9985245	2019	Bay Area Team Against Resistance	Grant	PROJECT ABSTRACT\nThe proposed Bay Area Team Against Resistance U54 Project (BATAR-UP) is an interdisciplinary effort of\ninvestigators to apply their knowledge and expertise to dissect the molecular and cellular basis of incomplete\nresponse and resistance to current treatments and to identify new treatment strategies to better neutralize or\neliminate residual disease and prevent resistance. This translational approach will be part of the NCI's Drug\nResistance and Sensitivity Centers Network to develop innovative strategies to understand and combat\nmechanisms of tumor resistance and exploit tumor sensitivity to anti-cancer therapies.\n To accomplish this, BATAR-UP will support two projects and one core driven by a multidisciplinary\nteam of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University. Project 1 will define and interrogate the molecular and\ncellular basis of residual disease in lung cancers treated with targeted inhibitors in clinical use. We will prioritize\nfor initial study both EGFR-mutant and ALK gene rearrangement positive lung cancers, given their importance\nas key molecular disease subtypes and our prior published work and expertise. We will harness genetic and\ntranscriptomic analysis of clinical samples (liquid and tumor biopsies) to provide a molecular view of the\nevolution of response, residual disease, and acquired resistance. We will generate organoid and PDX models\nand apply cutting-edge functional screens (genetic, pharmacologic, and targeted proteomic assays) to identify\nkey vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited, including with CTEP agents. This systematic\napproach will allow us to reveal the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that drives EGFR\nand ALK inhibitor resistance and pinpoint therapeutic strategies to intercept the evolution of residual disease\nand eventual acquired resistance. Project 2 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of\nresistance and residual disease in lung cancers treated with current immunotherapies, including PD-1 and PD-\nL1 antibodies. Leveraging shared platforms in synergy with Project 1, we will perform systematic analyses of\nliquid and tumor biopsy specimens (and ex vivo models) obtained from patients longitudinally before and\nduring treatment and upon acquired resistance. We will focus our studies on EGFR and ALK wild type patients,\nincluding squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma patients where immunotherapy has shown efficacy\nbut is typically non-curative. We will leverage (1) a novel lung cancer organoid model wherein tumor biopsies\nare cultured as both tumor epithelium and their endogenous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) en bloc as a\ncohesive unit, and (2) deep droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Our systematic approach will help\ndefine the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that contributes to immunotherapy resistance\nand identify potential new therapeutic strategies to help convert these incomplete responses into curative\noutcomes. Our Administrative Core will provide leadership, coordination and oversight for BATAR-UP with\nthe overarching goal of synergizing the research conducted in the 2 Projects and the entire DRSC network.

project	4U54CA224083-02	U54CA224083	9985250	2019	Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	With the discovery of a number of new molecular targets and exponential increase in the number of anti-cancer\nagents, it has become imperative to optimize preclinical models in order to design rational clinical trials.\nRecognizing the unique advantage of the patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) models in drug testing and\npersonalized medicine, physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and\nthe Siteman Cancer Center have been actively generating and utilizing PDX models for cancer research and\nthe evaluation of molecularly targeted agents. Building on our strength and existing infrastructure, we propose\nto establish the Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center (WU-PDTC), as part of PDXNet\nprogram, to promote preclinical testing in a collaborative nation-wide effort.\nThe PDX core within WU-PDTC will develop and characterize at least 1000 new pathogen-free PDX models\nacross major tumor types. The PDX models will be genomically and phenotypically characterized using the\nlatest ‘omics technologies and expertly analyzed using the most current data analysis pipelines that have been\ndeployed for other large scale NCI programs. The Bioinformatics Core will integrate these analyzes with clinical\nannotation from the originating patient to include patient treatment history and tumor response (Aim 1). Our two\nresearch projects will conduct PDX clinical trials using single agent and combinational agents using drugs\nunder NCI-IND (Aim 2). Project 1 will test pan- or beta isoform specific class I PI3K inhibitors in over 100\nbreast PDX models while Project 2 will study combinatorial approaches that overcome tumor intrinsic and\nextrinsic mechanisms to ERK inhibition in over 100 already available pancreatic PDX models. Proteogenomic\nand clinical response data will be collected in these models, as part of a broader effort of characterizing PDX\nmodels and conducting clinical correlation and treatment response analyses by the Bioinformatics Core (Aim\n3). All relevant information, including proteogenomic features of PDX models and treatment/response history,\nwill be tracked in a dedicated relational database that will be accessible to PDXNet and PDMR-FNLCR. The\ngoal is to identify candidates for human clinical trials for the ET-CTN. In Aim 4, the WU-PDTC will leverage\nexisting expertise and programs from the NCI-designated Comprehensive Siteman Cancer Center, Institute of\nClinical and Translational Research (ITCS), McDonnell Genome Institute, Mallinkrodt Imaging Research\nCenter, and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN) to support the goals of developing and utilizing\nPDX models to test and improve cancer treatment, in collaboration with other components of the PDXNet.\nFinally, WU-PDTC, through coordination by the Administration Core, will support pilot research projects\nutilizing the PDX resources and fostering collaboration across PDTCs, PNMR-FNLCR, and other NCI\nprograms. The goal is to increase the spectrum of agents tested in PDX clinical trials and to improve the\nreliability, validation, utility, and standardization of PDX models through innovative Cross-PDXNet research.\nOur demonstrated capability in generating and utilizing PDX models, extensive existing infrastructure, and\nstrong institutional commitment set a solid foundation for a successful PDTC that will help achieve goals set by\nNCI in advancing the use of PDX models in preclinical testing.

project	4UH3CA202663-03	UH3CA202663	9756833	2018	Cytology-Free POC Cervical Cancer Diagnostics for Global Health	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):HPV-associated cervical cancer is among the leading causes of death in women worldwide, with more 500,000 cases and 275,000 deaths annually. While repeated screening through frequent use of the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear has drastically reduced the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in developed nations, the vast majority of cervical cancer-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries with minimal healthcare infrastructure. Cytology-based prevention programs have proven to be extremely difficult to implement and sustain in low-resource settings, and as a result over 85% of new cervical cancer cases originate in developing countries. The lack of adequate infrastructure for traditional cytology-based screening combined with the presentation of cervical cancer, where symptoms are not present until the cancer is in an advanced stage, emphasize the clinical need for a screening test appropriate for low resource settings. Development of a reliable Point-of-Care (POC) test with high sensitivity and specificity has the ability to reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer worldwide. We propose to develop a novel nanotechnology- based diagnostic assay platform to detect cervical cancer progression in low-resource settings. This multiplex assay platform, which is currently being developed for non-oncology applications by Becton Dickinson (BD), is designed to be low-cost, easy to use, and inexpensive. We propose to adapt this platform to develop a highly specific diagnostic test that will screen women who do not need treatment and identify women with cervical lesions who need to be referred for colposcopy. The diagnostic test is based on Surfaced Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) technology, that enables detection of multiple targets in a complex sample without the need for washing or purification. The test and analysis is completed in less than 30 minutes, provides a "sample-in- answer-out" workflow, making the platform ideal for a "screen and treat" test in low-resource settings. Diagnostic development and validation will be done in close collaboration with a multidisciplinary team with expertise in HPV and cervical cancer screening as well as clinical oncology. By combining BD's experience in assay development, global healthcare delivery, and regulatory approval with the clinical expertise of other team members, the team has the expertise required to develop and validate a POC cervical cancer test for low resource settings. In addition to BD assay development, engineering, global healthcare delivery, and regulatory personnel, the team includes Dr. Jennifer S. Smith (UNC-Chapel Hill), Dr. Douglas Clark (UNM), Dr. Mark Stoler (UVA Health System), Dr. Scott McClelland (UW), and clinical validation site leaders including Dr. You-Lin Qiao (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences), Dr. Nelly Mugo (Kenya Medical Research Institute), Dr. Jose Fregnani (Barretos Cancer Hospital), and Dr. Adhemar Longatto-Filho (Barretos Cancer Hospital, Brazil).

project	4UH3CA233229-02	UH3CA233229	9997410	2019	ACCISIS-Chicago	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nScreening for colorectal cancer (CRC) not only detects disease early but also prevents cancer by finding and\nremoving precancerous polyps. The overall goal of our project, Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening\nand Follow-up through Implementation Science in Chicago (ACCSIS-Chicago), is to test a multilevel,\nmulticomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among\nracial/ethnic minority and low income populations in Chicago, Illinois. In this project, we will include two\ndifferent types of implementation strategies: 1) evidence-based multilevel, multicomponent intervention to\nincrease rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care; and 2) implementation support strategies to\nsupport the implementation process that contribute to the adoption, implementation and sustainment of our\nproposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention. We will partner with 4 federally qualified health centers\n(FQHCs), which have 35 clinics in the Chicago area and provided primary care service to nearly 188,000\nracial/ethnic minority and low income populations in 2016. During the UG3 Planning-Exploratory Phase, we will\nwork with one of the 4 FQHC partners to pilot test, measure, and refine our proposed multilevel,\nmulticomponent intervention in preparation for the experimental trial in the UH3 Implementation Phase, as well\nas assess the effectiveness of our implementation support strategies. In the UH3 Implementation Phase, we\nwill use a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and impact of our\nmultilevel, multicomponent intervention on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care\nacross our 4 partner FQHCs. The selection of our intervention components will be based on intensive literature\nreview, and findings and lessons learned from our previous studies and projects. Our multilevel intervention\ncomponents will include EMR provider reminders, provider assessment and feedback, patient navigation,\nprovider education and community outreach. We will also test one local innovation, IL ColonCARES, during the\nUGH Phase to increase the rate of follow-up after a positive stool test among uninsured patients by linking\nuninsured patients with specialty services.

In North\nCarolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions.\nCommunity health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable\npopulations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%.\nSubstantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and\nsystem-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening\ntargets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based\nscreening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase\nscreening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to\nsystematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for\nuninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from\nstakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We\nhypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective\napproaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through\nimproved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research,\nimplementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central\nhypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based\ninterventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable.\nThe specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention\nto increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot\nstudies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a\nprocess for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2\n(Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening\napproaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess\nimplementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the\nmultilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This\nproject is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation\nmodeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact\non CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities.

Specifically, the\nAppalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern\nKentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the\narea are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents\nscreened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence\non CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of\nKentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with\nAppalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention\nand control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted\nfrom evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the\ncommunity (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in\n12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base\nfor a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically\nunderserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden\nof CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test,\nmeasure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH\nand Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI\napproval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI\nin a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC\nscreening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2)\nAssess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with\ncommunity and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to\nearly or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined\nby US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county-\nlevel behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk\nFactor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating\nCenter, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community\npartners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia.

Grant	ABSTRACT\nColorectal cancer (CRC) screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality. The US\nPreventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends CRC screening through a variety of invasive and non-\ninvasive tests for individuals aged 50 to 75 years. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and other strategies\nexist to promote CRC screening, but adoption and implementation of these are limited, especially in CHCs.\nOur hypothesis is that a Hub and Spoke multilevel intervention will be superior to usual care. The hub will be\nHealth Quality Partners of Southern California (HQP), a non-profit organization comprised of 16 CHC systems\n(spokes), serving 135 rural and urban clinic sites. We propose a 2-phase study to pilot and optimize (Phase I)\nand rigorously test (Phase II) the Hub and Spoke approach and its impact on CRC screening, follow-up, and\nusual care. UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary\noutcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed\nmethods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients\nserved by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and\ncoordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3\nImplementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a\nregionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care\namong CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability\nModel (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,\nMaintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness\nof the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post\nimplementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3)\nproportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and\nsustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods\napproach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM\nconstructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e.\npatients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and\nSustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of\nImplementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate\nprogress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are\nscalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.

Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up\ncolonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing\nprogram with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage\npartnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest\nCenter for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation\nsupport to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate\nworking with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics\n(reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients).\nIn Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a\nlarge-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor\nsupported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never\nbeen screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to\nsupport follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and\nrecruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the\ntraining and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings.\nIn Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi-\nexperimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice\nfacilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan-\nvendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never\nbeen screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred\nfor colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will\nevaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and\nqualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program\nthrough partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care\nclinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO\n(Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model.

Among patients with NF1, loss of\nthe non-mutant allele of NF1 in a rare Schwann cell or precursor, along with other ill-defined factors, leads to\nbenign dermal or plexiform neurofibromas. The main cause of death among NF1 patients is the malignant\nperipheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most likely develops\nfrom plexiform neurofibroma, in particular the so-called “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma. Approximately half of\nMPNSTs are NF1-associated, and NF1 patients have 10-15% lifetime risk of developing this terrible cancer.\nMPNSTs metastasize early and are often resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main treatment for\nMPNSTs is surgical resection but, despite radical excision with wide surgical margins, followed by\nchemoradiation, 5-year survival rates are poor due to metastases as well as local recurrence. NF1 patients\ncould greatly benefit from prophylactic vaccination that would prevent the malignant transformation of benign\nplexiform neurofibromas into “atypical” plexiform neurofibromas and to MPNSTs. We aim to determine if the\nmutations that govern the development of “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma (NF1 loss followed by CDKN2A\nloss) and MPSNT (NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12 loss) lead to the expression of recurrent alternately processed\ntranscripts, such as transcriptionally-induced chimeras, that could express neoantigens and be used as targets\nfor prophylactic vaccines. Such transcripts can be translated to produce novel peptides downstream of\nframeshift mutations caused by coding exon read-through into introns, mis-splicing from a coding exon to a\nnon-canonical splice acceptors or splice acceptors in other genes. In most cases, a premature termination\ncodon (PTC) will be rapidly encountered by the ribosome translating such transcripts. Therefore, we\nfurthermore hypothesize that these alternately processed transcripts can express what we call “cryptic”\nneoantigens when treated with drugs that suppress utilization of premature codons such as Ataluren or\ngentamycin. In such a way, we could administer a prophylactic vaccine and induce conditionally active immune\nresponse that would eliminate nascent tumors only when drug treatment is used.

project	4UH3CA244697-03	UH3CA244697	10465296	2021	Intercepting progression from pre-invasive to invasive lung adenocarcinoma	Grant	Abstract\nDespite advances in therapeutic strategies, non-small cell lung cancer remains a deadly disease. An\nimproved understanding of the biology of lung cancer is needed to intercept the disease at an early point in\nits progression. Our project, which is inspired by that challenge, focuses on events transpiring in the earliest\nradiographically-detected manifestation of lung cancer: the computerized tomography (CT)-detected non-\nsolid nodule, of which as many as 40% harbor frankly invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, despite conventional\nwisdom that CT-detected non-solid nodules represent pre or minimally invasive malignancy, clearly transition\nto more invasive histologies occurs in a significant proportion of these nodules.\nUnderstanding the cellular and molecular changes within non-solid nodules that drive progression will provide\nunique and novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that\nalterations in cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a role in initiating and supporting this\nprogression. In agreement with that proposal, our preliminary multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) studies\nsuggest that progression to a more invasive phenotype is associated with the development of a strong\nimmunosuppressive TME. In this project we test our hypothesis using multidimensional methods to profile the\nTME and to determine the crosstalk between cancer cells and the TME in pre-invasive to invasive human\nlung non-solid adenocarcinomas. Comparative analysis of the cellular and molecular events associated with\nthe distinct histological stages will lead to identification of the critical events triggering progression and\nthereby identify targets to intercept disease progression. We will use appropriate mouse models in pre-clinical\nstudies to develop these targets as strategies to intercept progression of pre-invasive to invasive cancer.\nIn the first phase of these studies (UG3 phase), we will define TME alterations associated with progression of\nlung nodules using RNAseq profiling and image-based methods (multiplex IF and imaging CyTOF) in studies\nof our archival tumor samples. These studies will generate a comprehensive catalogue of the cellular and\nmolecular events that trigger progression of indolent lesions to frankly invasive cancers, with a strong focus\non immune mechanisms. These analyses will provide novel and detailed insights into how the composition\nand activity of the TME changes with progression. In the second phase (UH3 phase), we will leverage mouse\nmodels to explore interception strategies to target immune mechanisms and prevent progression.\nThe proposed cohort satisfies the RFA’s focus on High-Risk Cohorts for Cancer-Immunoprevention Studies,\nsince lung nodules are premalignancies highly prevalent in smokers.

project	5P01AI118688-05	P01AI118688	9942357	2020	Disruption of T cell tolerance in type 1 diabetes	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nAutoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes arise through a breakdown in immune tolerance. We have now\ncome to understand that immune tolerance consists of a multi-layered network that keeps such untoward\nresponses in check. In this program project grant, three complementary teams will be working together to\nfurther unravel how these checkpoints operate to improve our understanding of autoimmunity and ultimately\nimprove its treatment. This program project will have three highly collaborative and interactive projects headed\nby Drs. Mark Anderson (Project 1), Jeff Bluestone (Project 2) and John Kappler (Project 3) along with two\nscientific cores (Animal core and Molecular core). The major themes of the grant are:\n1. The impact of central thymic tolerance on the T effector and Treg repertoire in T1D..\n2. Insulin as a critical self-antigen specificity for both T effectors and T regulatory cells in T1D.\n3. Peptide specificity of Tregulatory cells in T1D\n4. Using peptide binding characteristics of islet antigens to improve bioassays and tolerance methods.\nThe long term objectives of this work is to improve our understanding of how T cell tolerance is controlled and\nthe further refining the specificity of the autoreactive T cell response in type 1 diabetes. The investigators will\nbe using state of the art tools in both animal models and in human subjects with type 1 diabetes. Results of\nthese studies will help further refine our understanding of autoimmunity and help improve methods for its\ntreatment and diagnosis.

The goal of our Program is to advance the pre-clinical\nscience of NSCLC therapeutics. During the current funding period, our Program has advanced inhibitors of\nEGFR, promoting the pre-clinical development of osimertinib and related molecules, of TBK1, and of DDR2. In\nits next 5 years, our Program aims to develop compounds that will lead to more effective treatments for\nNSCLC and prevent or overcome resistance to existing and future targeted therapies.\n To accomplish these goals, the Program seeks to achieve the following overall aims via 3 inter-related and\ncollaborative Projects and 4 intellectually driven Shared Resource Cores.\n--Overall Aim 1. Develop inhibitors and/or degraders focused on mutant EGFR, KRAS signaling effectors, and\nmechanisms of transcriptional adaptation in non-small cell lung cancer.\n--Overall Aim 2. Characterize these compounds and their targets pharmacologically using genetically defined\ncellular and animal models of lung cancer.\n--Overall Aim 3. Develop and assess combinations of these potent and selective novel agents with existing\ntherapies to prevent and overcome therapeutic resistance.\n These aims leverage innovations in chemistry and structural biology—the development of allosteric kinase\ninhibitors and selective degraders—coupled with expertise in lung cancer biology, lung cancer cellular and\nanimal modeling, and functional genomic approaches to understanding pathways, through the Projects and\nCores. The broad aims will be implemented with three focused projects aimed at developing inhibitors of key\npathways in NSCLC as well as over-arching mechanisms of resistance:\n--Project 1: Development of pharmacologic strategies to degrade mutant EGFR.\n--Project 2: Identification of combination therapy for KRAS-driven lung cancers.\n--Project 3: Targeting transcriptional mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.\n Each Project and the overall Program is based on the innovative, technology-driven Cores, each led by\nfaculty with expertise in the specific areas.\nCore A: Medicinal Chemistry.\nCore B: Structure and Biochemistry.\nCore C: Animal Modeling and Preclinical Therapeutics.\nCore D: Program Administration.\n The integration of the three Projects and the four Cores will enable an effective co-ordination to meet\nProgram aims by cross-fertilization of lung cancer focus and technological expertise.

project	5P01CA155258-10	P01CA155258	10226185	2021	Integrative Oncogenomics of Multiple Myeloma	Grant	Project Summary (Overall)\nThis renewal application stems from our successful first four years of a new program project grant funded in\n2011, which brings together a talented group of investigators with expertise in basic biology (DFCI and\nWhitehead Institute at MIT), clinical science (IFM), as well as genomic and cell signaling (Sanger Institute UK\nand DFCI). During the prior 4 years of funding period, we have 1. defined the role of transplant in the era of\nnovel agents; 2 Established the role of molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) in myeloma. 3. Established\nthe role of both MRI and PET/CT in diagnosis and follow up of MM patients. 4. Identified and Validated number\nof novel targets. and 5. Defined patterns of clonal evolution and mutational signatures being utilized in MM.\nOur program has also developed novel targeted sequencing platform, developed a pipeline to identify\nmutations using RNA-seq, and developed a publicly available data analysis portal (Canevolve.org). Building on\nthese advances, The overall specific objectives of the program are 1) To determine whether maintenance can\nbe tailored based upon MRD status and whether achieving MRD negative status provides superior outcome In\na 1260 patient randomized clinical study and to develop novel risk model (Project 1). Clinically annotated\npatient samples from this clinical trial will be utilized to study genomic and epigenomic correlates; 2) To identify\nthe spectrum of epigenomic lesions and enhancer dependencies that underlie pathogenesis, progression, and\nclinical outcome in MM. (Project 2). New clinically-relevant epigenomic-centered targets identified will be\nvalidated further; 3) To identify and validate the molecular circuits/loops responsible for continued MM cell\ngrowth and develop strategies to interrupt these loops as a novel therapeutic approach. (Project 3). New\ntargeted therapeutic agents will be translated to clinical trials to improve patient outcome; and 4) To define the\nimpact of therapy on clonal evolution and identify mediators of genomic instability underlying disease prognosis\nand progression in MM (Project 4). New clinically relevant processes identified will be used to understand\nprocess of progression. These 4 projects will be supported by Administrative and Communication Core (1),\nClinical and Tissue Core (2); Genomics Core (3); Genomic Sequencing Core (4) and Biostatistical and\nBioinformatics Cores (5). This unique collaborative effort will improve our understanding of myeloma biology\nand define a new treatment paradigm for this presently incurable disease.

project	5P01CA210944-02	P01CA210944	9531295	2018	Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy	Grant	The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology\nand to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation\ntherapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4\nimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory\neffects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across\nmultiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and\nanimal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of\nprojects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on\ntwo clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT\n(HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and\ndurvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast\ncarcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the\nmechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining\ndendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of\nresistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in\nProjects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this\nP01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a\nstate-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to\ndrive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact\nis to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune\ntherapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.

The CAR developed at our center is now in international trials for refractory/relapsed pre-B cell acute\nlymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic\nlymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remain as the major unmet medical need in blood cancers. Our central hypothesis\nis that therapies with combination of CAR T cells and universal CAR T cells created with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic\nediting will enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer. We have\nbrought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and\npublished together for many years. Each disease-focused project will be led by a recognized authority in the\nfield. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which will coordinately closely with essential\nshared resource cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients\non two clinical trials: (i) CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD22 will be used to address the remaining unmet\nmedical need in ALL, which is the emergence of CD19 escape variants; and (ii) universal CAR T cells targeting\nCD19 will be tested in patients with CLL to determine the role of T cell intrinsic resistance to therapy. In AML,\nthe central problem in CAR T cell therapy is the lack of a known surface antigen that is present on AML but\nlacking from normal hematopoiesis. The goal of Project 2 is to open a wide therapeutic window by genetically\nmodifying normal marrow to make it resistant to killing by anti-AML CAR T cells, and delivering potent anti-\nleukemic CAR T cells specific for CD33. In Project 3, the overall hypothesis is that anti-myeloma efficacy will be\nmaximized by (i) combining CART-BCMA and CTL019 to eliminate both the dominant neoplastic PC population\nand rare myeloma-propagating B cells, and (ii) modifying CAR T cells to circumvent specific myeloma-induced\nT-cell-inhibitory mechanisms (i.e., immune checkpoints).\nThe Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of project management for collaboration\nand biostatistics, clinical safety and monitoring, and fiscal support (Core A), a GMP facility for manufacture of\ncells and RNA (Core B), and a state-of-the-art platform for GLP analysis to provide high dimensional data of the\nsamples generated in all Projects (Core C).

In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients\non two clinical trials: (i) CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD22 will be used to address the remaining unmet\nmedical need in ALL, which is the emergence of CD19 escape variants; and (ii) universal CAR T cells targeting\nCD19 will be tested in patients with CLL to determine the role of T cell intrinsic resistance to therapy. In AML,\nthe central problem in CAR T cell therapy is the lack of a known surface antigen that is present on AML but\nlacking from normal hematopoiesis. The goal of Project 2 is to open a wide therapeutic window by genetically\nmodifying normal marrow to make it resistant to killing by anti-AML CAR T cells, and delivering potent anti-\nleukemic CAR T cells specific for CD33. In Project 3, the overall hypothesis is that anti-myeloma efficacy will be\nmaximized by (i) combining CART-BCMA and CTL019 to eliminate both the dominant neoplastic PC population\nand rare myeloma-propagating B cells, and (ii) modifying CAR T cells to circumvent specific myeloma-induced\nT-cell-inhibitory mechanisms (i.e., immune checkpoints).\nThe Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of project management for collaboration\nand biostatistics, clinical safety and monitoring, and fiscal support (Core A), a GMP facility for manufacture of\ncells and RNA (Core B), and a state-of-the-art platform for GLP analysis to provide high dimensional data of the\nsamples generated in all Projects (Core C).

project	5P01CA214278-05	P01CA214278	10245062	2021	Enhancing Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapies for Hematologic Malignancies: Beyond CART 19	Grant	OVERALL SUMMARY\nThe long-term goal of this P01 is to develop next generation immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR) T cells and to translate this research into new therapies with curative potential for patients with blood\ncancer. The CAR developed at our center is now in international trials for refractory/relapsed pre-B cell acute\nlymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic\nlymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remain as the major unmet medical need in blood cancers. Our central hypothesis\nis that therapies with combination of CAR T cells and universal CAR T cells created with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic\nediting will enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer. We have\nbrought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and\npublished together for many years. Each disease-focused project will be led by a recognized authority in the\nfield. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which will coordinately closely with essential\nshared resource cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients\non two clinical trials: (i) CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD22 will be used to address the remaining unmet\nmedical need in ALL, which is the emergence of CD19 escape variants; and (ii) universal CAR T cells targeting\nCD19 will be tested in patients with CLL to determine the role of T cell intrinsic resistance to therapy.

Encompassed\nwithin this broad overall goal are the following more specific goals: 1) develop novel therapeutic strategies for\nadvanced/recurrent endometrial cancer and aggressive subtypes; 2) promote novel strategies for unmet\nclinical needs in prevention and conservative therapy of high-risk precancerous lesions and low grade\nendometrial cancer; 3) incorporate molecular diagnostics into clinical decision-making; and 4) recruit and\nsupport new investigators in endometrial cancer research through the Career Enhancement and\nDevelopmental Research Programs. Over the last 5 years, our SPORE has led the field with a highly\nproductive translational research team that has helped to define the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of\nendometrial cancer. This proposal includes 4 translational research projects addressing scientific problems\nthat span the breadth of endometrial cancer heterogeneity in an effort to impact as many patients as possible.\nProject 1, “Novel Targeted Strategies for Prevention and Conservative Management of Complex Atypical\nHyperplasia and Grade 1 Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer,” includes a phase II trial using the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus to improve standard conservative therapy (progestin-eluting intrauterine device) and is paired with\ninnovative molecular profiling and pharmacologic approaches to further advance conservative treatment\noptions. Project 2, “CTNNB1 Mutation and Wnt Pathway Activation Define Clinically Aggressive Endometrioid\nEndometrial Carcinoma,” focuses on targeted therapeutics and molecular mechanisms underlying a clinically\naggressive subtype of endometrioid endometrial cancer that is driven through beta-catenin mutation and\ndownstream Wnt pathway activation. Project 3, “EphA2 Targeting in Uterine Carcinoma,” focuses on the\ntherapeutic target, EphA2. EphA2 is overexpressed especially in higher grade endometrioid carcinomas and in\nserous carcinoma and is associated with poor overall survival. A phase I clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy\nand toxicity of a novel therapeutic (EPHARNA) that targets EphA2 by delivering short interfering RNA into\ntumor cells via a neutral liposome nanovehicle. This therapeutic was developed by Project 3 investigators.\nProject 4, “A Framework for Identification of Novel Targeted Therapy Combinations in Endometrial Cancer,”\nwill evaluate tumor molecular changes from samples procured during a combinatorial trial of PARP and PI3K\npathway targeted therapy to identify biomarkers of benefit for patients with endometrial cancer. This is paired\nwith implementing a platform to evaluate mechanisms responsible for adaptive resistance to targeted therapies\nin order to enable a rational design of improved combination therapies. Four Cores will support these projects-\nAdministrative Core, Pathology Core, Biomarkers Core, and Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) targeted in this proposal are rare tumors that face all of these challenges. NETs arise from the diffuse neuroendocrine system, occur in both adults and children, and are increasing in both incidence and prevalence in the United States. The University of Iowa is one of only a handful of academic or private institutions in the US where patients with NETs are diagnosed, treated, and regularly followed in a comprehensive manner. A multi-disciplinary NET clinic, an IRB approved registry and database, and a growing translational research program are housed at the University of Iowa. We have collaborated with pharmaceutical and biotech companies, patient support groups, and other research institutions whose expertise complements our clinical and translational expertise, to build a neuroendocrine tumor Center of Excellence. Iowa is poised to house the first SPORE in neuroendocrine tumors where academic, industry, and philanthropic organizations will partner with NCI to increase the length and quality of life for these unique patients. Our Overall Specific Aims are: 1. Support innovative translational research in Neuroendocrine Tumors. 2. Provide support to translational investigators through interactive cores. 3. Enlist and encourage new translational researchers in neuroendocrine tumors through developmental projects and career development. 4.

project	5P50CA174521-05	P50CA174521	9756316	2019	Neuroendocrine Tumor Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Human Cancer	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare tumors present several challenges, including lack of evidence based treatment recommendations, unwillingness of insurance companies to support unproven therapies, and keen competition for translational research support that may benefit only a small proportion of all cancer patients. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) targeted in this proposal are rare tumors that face all of these challenges. NETs arise from the diffuse neuroendocrine system, occur in both adults and children, and are increasing in both incidence and prevalence in the United States. The University of Iowa is one of only a handful of academic or private institutions in the US where patients with NETs are diagnosed, treated, and regularly followed in a comprehensive manner. A multi-disciplinary NET clinic, an IRB approved registry and database, and a growing translational research program are housed at the University of Iowa. We have collaborated with pharmaceutical and biotech companies, patient support groups, and other research institutions whose expertise complements our clinical and translational expertise, to build a neuroendocrine tumor Center of Excellence. Iowa is poised to house the first SPORE in neuroendocrine tumors where academic, industry, and philanthropic organizations will partner with NCI to increase the length and quality of life for these unique patients. Our Overall Specific Aims are: 1. Support innovative translational research in Neuroendocrine Tumors. 2. Provide support to translational investigators through interactive cores. 3. Enlist and encourage new translational researchers in neuroendocrine tumors through developmental projects and career development. 4. Promote early and accurate diagnosis through outreach to physicians and advocacy groups.	90Y;Adult;Advocacy;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;Biometry;Biotechnology;Bone Marrow;Cancer Patient;Child;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collaborations;Communication;Complement;Data Analyses;Data Quality;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Imaging;Diagnostic Procedure;Diffuse;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Effectiveness;Evidence based treatment;Expression Profiling;Face;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genomic approach;Human;Image;Incidence;Industry;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Institutional Review Boards;Insurance;Investments;Iowa;Islet Cell Tumor;Kidney;Length;Malignant Neoplasms;Molecular;Mutate;Neuroendocrine Therapy;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Neurosecretory Systems;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Physicians;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prevalence;Privatization;Prognostic Marker;Quality Control;Quality of life;Radiation Dose Unit;Radioisotopes;Radiopharmaceuticals;Recommendation;Registries;Research;Research Support;Resistance;Small Intestines;Source;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Structure;Support Groups;Toxic effect;Tracer;Translating;Translational Research;Tumor Bank;Tumor Tissue;United States;Universities;accurate diagnosis;career development;chemotherapeutic agent;exome;imaging agent;improved;innovation;metaiodobenzylguanidine;molecular marker;multidisciplinary;new therapeutic target;novel diagnostics;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;outreach;patient population;public health relevance;rare cancer;theranostics;therapeutic target;translational research program;translational scientist;tumor	UNIVERSITY OF IOWA	IOWA CITY	IA	UNITED STATES	DAWN E QUELLE	DCTD	Steven F Nothwehr	2139000	>=$1M	2139000	26-Aug-2019	1-Sep-2015	31-Aug-2022	PAR-14-031	Moonshot

The UIVI Prostate SPORE supports an interactive group of basic and clinical investigators in a translational research program that has led to major discoveries in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. Successful translation of discoveries in the most recent grant period include: 1) development of a urine test for prostate cancer which is now offered in CLIA reference laboratories (Sci TransI Med. 2011); 2) ETS gene fusion driven PCa that are susceptible to PARP inhibitor therapy (Cancer Cell 2011) which initiated a randomized Phase II trial (NCTOI576172); 3) germline mutations in HOXB 13 gene that conferred increased risk for PCa (N Engl J Med. 2012). This is being developed as a test for assessing PCa risk; 4) the first study describing the mutational landscape of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (Nature 2012,) and; 5) Cabozantinib was shown to have efficacy and decrease bone pain in prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis (J Clin Oncol. 2013). These bench-to-bedside applications were aided by horizontal collaborations with the Dana Farber, Baylor, Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins Prostate SPOREs as well as the EDRN and vertical collaborations with SWOG and biotech companies. This application consists of four multidisciplinary projects: Project 1: A Precision Medicine Approach to Elucidate Mechanisms of Progression and Resistance to Therapy in Advanced PCa; Project 2: Mechanisms of Sensitivity and Resistance to Cabozantinib in CRPC; Project 3: Development of Novel BET Bromodomain Inhibitors for the Treatment of Advanced PCa; Project 4: Development of IncRNAs as PCa Biomarkers in Urine. These projects are complemented by ongoing, successful Career Development and Developmental Research Programs. The projects and programs are supported by a strong ongoing institutional commitment of money and space as well as three cores: Administration, Biostatistics, and Tissue/Informatics. The UM Prostate SPORE program continues to place premiums on rigorous scientific review of its translational research programs, pairing of basic and clinical investigators, drawing on expertise of scientists from within and fro outside the prostate cancer field, and utilizing flexibility to fund promising new research approaches. The interaction of our multidisciplinary group of investigators clearly makes the Prostate SPORE program at the UMCCC is greater than the sum of its individual parts.

This work is urgently needed\nbecause cancer screening and prevention disparities exist with regard to delivery of evidence-based\ninterventions (EBIs). Effective strategies to improve implementation of EBIs in primary care community health\ncenters (CHCs) that can eliminate these disparities are not known or poorly understood. Implementation\nscience can contribute new knowledge that will transform CHCs' ability to serve the nation's most vulnerable\npopulations. The BRIDGE-C2 Center will: 1) create a sustainable infrastructure for developing, conducting, and\ncontinuously evaluating implementation strategies that enhance primary care's ability to equitably deliver\nevidence-based cancer screening and prevention interventions to all people, emphasizing closing care gaps\nfor vulnerable populations; 2) build capacity and training opportunities, and engage a multi-disciplinary team of\nimplementation science and methods experts, to facilitate the development of innovative approaches relevant\nto our grand challenge; and 3) identify strategies to improve implementation of cancer screening and\nprevention EBIs in primary care, and conduct research / develop pragmatic methods to tailor, enhance, and\nsupport the adoption and sustainability of these strategies. We will build on the strong established partnerships\nbetween researchers at Oregon Health & Science (OHSU) primary care, the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute,\nand the OCHIN Implementation Laboratory (a well-established national network of >500 CHCs that share an\nelectronic health record through the OCHIN Practice-Based Research Network). The BRIDGE-C2 Center will\nconduct pilot studies that develop and test strategies to improve implementation of EBIs, rapidly scale up\nsuccessful pilots to conduct large scale pragmatic trials, and widely disseminate effective innovations to\nprimary care practices caring for underserved populations. Woven throughout these activities will be the\nCenter's focus on mentoring and training early career implementation scientists and leveraging collaborations\nto increase implementation science capacity. The Center's Administrative Core will serve as the nucleus that\nbridges the Research Program and Implementation Laboratory, providing support for research activities,\nleadership, governance, investigator development, dissemination, evaluation, and a connection to the national\nISCCC network. Our first two research pilots aim to improve cervical cancer screening and follow-up care and\ntobacco cessation. Our first two methods pilots will create novel capabilities to predict needed implementation\nsupport based on provider and practice characteristics. We will spread our discoveries and create mechanisms\nfor widely disseminating our findings and innovations to scientific, professional, and community networks to\nincrease implementation of cancer screening and prevention EBIs and decrease health disparities.

As an Advanced Center, the vision of the Washington University Implementation\nScience Center for Cancer Control (WU-ISCCC) is to conduct implementation research to help eliminate\ncancer disparities in rural and other disadvantaged communities.\nGoal. The overall goal of the WU-ISCCC is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for rapid-cycle\nimplementation research to increase the reach, external validity, and sustainability of effective cancer control\ninterventions. Our goal and Center activities capture three distinct features: (1) a focus on elimination of cancer\ndisparities; (2) the need for rapid-cycle studies; and (3) the use of systems science approaches to enhance\nmethods and outcomes in implementation science.\nSetting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration,\ncatalyzes new ideas, and ensures support for research that finds solutions for complex implementation\nchallenges in real-world settings with high cancer disparities (rural and urban counties in Missouri and Illinois).\nSubstantial matching contributions from Washington University will allow us to strategically invest in new ideas.\nAims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) advance the field of implementation science in cancer control\nby conducting innovative and impactful research; (2) expand an exceptional, diverse team of implementation\nscience investigators and stakeholders; (3) organize and integrate Center components to facilitate\ntransdisciplinary team science; (4) develop an Implementation Laboratory (known as the “Innovation\nIncubator”) to serve as a conduit for innovative, rapid-cycle, and impactful research; and (5) address cancer\ndisparities by making it as easy as possible for disadvantaged populations to encounter, use, and benefit from\nevidence-based interventions.\nInnovations and impact. The WU-ISCCC will be innovative and provide a significant return on the scientific\ninvestment. First, our Center has distinctive features that include a combined focus on cancer disparities, the\napplication of strategies to conduct rapid-cycle studies, and the use of systems science approaches. Second,\nwe have assembled a diverse, world class team with strong linkages to multiple practice settings that will be\ncritical parts of our Innovation Incubator. Third, we will engage investigators from different disciplines and\ninvest in the development of early career scholars as cancer implementation scientists. Fourth, we will\nstrategically and creatively disseminate products in ways that will benefit researchers, practitioners, and\ncommunity members. Fifth, we have developed a focused strategy for collective integration of our projects,\ncores, and units to ensure that the WU-ISCCC impact is greater than the sum of its individual parts. In\nsummary, the WU-ISCCC will be a national resource for furthering implementation science for eliminating\ncancer disparities.

Optimized\nimplementation occurs when: (1) the strategies employed to implement EBIs address the key barriers to\nimplementation that are active in the specific settings in which implementation occurs, and (2) those strategies\nreflect the best possible methods for addressing the barriers. Despite two decades of progress in implementation\nscience (IS), practical tools and guidance to support optimized EBI implementation are lacking; as a result,\nstrategies are often mismatched to barriers and are often not optimized for effectiveness, efficiency, or fit with local\nresources. The result is suboptimal implementation in the form of lost time, effort, and resources and, ultimately,\npoorer cancer outcomes. The OPTICC Center will advance IS and, in turn, improve EBI implementation in cancer\ncontrol by developing, testing, and refining innovative methods for optimizing EBI implementation. The OPTICC\nCenter is a strategic collaboration of the University of Washington (UW), Kaiser Permanente Washington Health\nResearch Institute (KPWHRI), and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three cores will\nsupport its work. The Administrative Core will promote multidisciplinary collaboration, research excellence, and\nmethodological innovation. It will also lead Center outreach and dissemination efforts, evaluate Center impact, and\ncoordinate Center activities. The Research Program Core will conduct innovative implementation studies, method\nand measurement studies, and small pilot studies that advance the Center’s “grand challenge” IS theme of\noptimizing EBI implementation. A three-stage approach to optimizing EBI implementation will be taken—identify\nand prioritize barriers, match strategies, and test strategies—with measurement development spanning all three\nstages. The Implementation Laboratory Core will establish and coordinate a network of diverse clinical and\ncommunity sites to conduct “in vivo” IS studies, implement cancer control EBIs, and shape the Center’s research\nagenda. The Center’s initial studies will focus on optimizing implementation of screening EBIs for cervical,\ncolorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer. However, the methods for optimizing EBI implementation that the Center\nwill develop, test, and refine can be applied broadly across the cancer care continuum, for a wide range of cancers,\nto answer a wide range of IS questions.

The impact of these strategies on cancer outcomes is\nsignificant for both the general population and low income and under-represented groups that bear a\ndisproportionate share of preventable cancer burden, but evidence-based interventions have not been\nuniformly used across population groups. Gaps in implementation of the evidence base can be seen for nearly\nall known cancer prevention and early detection strategies. As a result, we incur substantial avoidable cancer\nmorbidity and mortality and tolerate preventable inequities.\nThe Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity (ISCCCE) will create an ecosystem for robust\nimplementation science (IS) related to cancer prevention and control in Massachusetts community health\ncenters (CHCs) and their local communities. Our theme, improving community health by integrating health\nequity and implementation science for evidence-based cancer control, reflects our critical mass of expertise in\ncancer disparities, IS, and community-based cancer prevention and control research. Our “grand challenge”\nis to address the inequitable implementation and limited scale of evidence-based interventions by developing\nand testing implementation strategies aimed at narrowing health inequities and by advancing methods that\ncarefully consider the low-resource, complex nature of CHCs where adaptation and cost-effective solutions are\nneeded most. The implementation studies we conduct will address inequities within CHC clinical practice as\nwell as prevention interventions that link to community resources and assets. Our I-Lab is comprised of 31\nCHCs who are members of the Mass League of Community Health Centers and use a common EHR vendor-\nneutral population management system that has extensive reporting capability within and across CHCs, which\nwill allow us to study implementation outcomes in different geographic settings across the state using common\nmeasures. Given that achieving equity in community health requires clinical, community, and policy-level\ninterventions, our pilots will also examine how to expand the impact and sustainability of CHCs’ cancer\nprevention efforts through effective partnerships in community and policy settings. Our Network Unit connects\nus directly with other Moonshot IS initiatives and national community health leadership, and expands\nopportunities for collaboration and synergy, building IS capacity in our own institutions and across the nation.

These models and methods will be used to guide selection and implementation of\nevidence-based programs for cancer prevention and control (CPC). We will initially focus on lung cancer\nscreening in rural primary care settings, first in Colorado and then nationally through collaboration with a well-\nestablished primary care network (i.e., National Research Network).\nOur overarching framework will be our enhanced RE-AIM/PRISM model, which is an extension of the broadly\nused Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework with the addition of\ncontextual factors (e.g., Intervention characteristics, implementation and sustainability infrastructure). It will\nserve as the basis to develop and test innovative assessments of costs, benefits, and value from the\nperspective of different stakeholders to understand and guide implementation. We will meaningfully engage\nwith and include the perspectives of patients, providers, and staff stakeholders in all our studies. Our pilot\nImplementation Study will adapt, implement, and evaluate strategies using stakeholder-engaged approaches\nto value to guide the implementation of shared decision-making and smoking cessation related to lung cancer\nscreening.\nOur Methods Unit will refine and evaluate our pragmatic cost assessment methods to determine\nimplementation/replication costs from the perspective(s) of patients, providers, and delivery staff and then\ndevelop and pilot test brief survey measures of preferences regarding the relative benefit of different RE-AIM\noutcomes. We will then assess relationships among RE-AIM outcomes preferences and selection of different\nCPC programs. Finally, our Outreach and Network Unit will engage in a) outreach activities targeted at junior\nand mid-career investigators and practitioners including online professional development (e.g., graduate\ncertificate program, micro-certification) and tailored mentoring and technical assistance approaches; b)\ndissemination activities to support the packaging and communication of research findings; and c)\ncollaboration activities to facilitate partnerships on CPC and implementation science using multiple channels\nand including development of shared pragmatic D&I measures and data.

project	5P50CA244690-02	P50CA244690	10225988	2021	Advancing the Quality of Cancer Care through Behavioral Economics and Implementation Science	Grant	The grand challenge addressed by the Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (Penn ISC3) is\nto apply insights from behavioral economics to accelerate the pace at which evidence-based practices for cancer\ncare are deployed to improve outcomes for individuals with cancer. Penn offers a unique environment in which\nto conduct this paradigm-shifting work, given our expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics,\nand innovative cancer care delivery. The complementary and multi-disciplinary expertise of the three MPIs (Bei-\ndas, Bekelman, Schnoll), coupled with existing Penn resources, including the Penn Center for Cancer Care\nInnovation [PC3I], the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics [CHIBE], and the Penn Imple-\nmentation Science Center at the Leonard Davis Institute [PISCE@LDI], represent a unique opportunity to ad-\nvance the quality of cancer care. The Administrative Core, led by Drs. Beidas, Bekelman, and Schnoll, will ensure\nthat the activities of Penn ISC3 are coordinated, synergistic, and congruent with timelines. The Implementation\nLaboratory, led by Drs. Bekelman and Shulman, represents a diverse ecosystem that includes five hospitals and\nlinked clinical sites, with over 200 oncologists that serve over 15,000 unique new patients annually. Our Research\nProgram, led by Drs. Beidas and Buttenheim, will oversee the development and testing of implementation strat-\negies that target patients and clinicians within our Implementation Lab and are centered on the idea of ‘nudging’\nfor optimal implementation and effectiveness outcomes. The Research Program includes investigators with ex-\npertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery research, healthcare innovation,\nmeasurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we propose three Signature Pilot Projects and two\nMethods Projects with a commitment to rapid learning that will allow Penn ISC3 to be optimally nimble. Signature\nPilot Project 1 (Jenssen/Leone) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase referral\nto tobacco cessation programs among cancer patients. Signature Pilot Project 2 (Bekelman/Patel) tests patient-\nand clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase higher-value bone modifying agents in patients with\nbreast, lung, and prostate cancer. Common methods and measures are linked to allow for pooling of data and\nto accomplish our objectives of testing multilevel implementation strategies and mechanisms across contexts.\nOur exploratory and high-reward Signature Pilot Project 3 (Bekelman/Rendle) will test a patient-directed imple-\nmentation strategy that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to promote oral chemotherapy ad-\nherence and symptom management. Two methods projects, in support of the Projects, will advance the science\nof implementation methods. Methods Project 1 will develop a toolkit for the application of rapid cycle approaches\n(Asch/Buttenheim); Methods Project 2 will use qualitative comparative analysis to characterize multilevel con-\ntextual variation (Barg/Rendle). The Penn ISC3 has the potential to identify novel, disseminable, and scalable\nways to advance the quality of cancer care and improve the health outcomes for individuals with cancer.\nPHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page	Address;African American;American;Artificial Intelligence;Behavior;Cancer Center;Cancer Control;Cancer Patient;Communication;Communities;Coupled;Data Pooling;Development;Economics;Ecosystem;Ensure;Environment;Event;Evidence based practice;Eye;Female;Foundations;Funding;Future;Goals;Grant;Health;Healthcare;Hospitals;Incentives;Individual;Institutes;International;Knowledge;Laboratories;Latinx;Learning;Link;Literature;Machine Learning;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Measurement;Measures;Medicaid;Medical;Medicine;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone;Methods;National Cancer Institute;Oncologist;Oral;Outcome;Patients;Pennsylvania;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilot Projects;Psychology;Qualitative Methods;Recommendation;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Science;Scientist;Site;System;Technology;Testing;TimeLine;Tobacco Use Cessation;Tobacco use;Training;Underserved Population;Uninsured;Universities;Variant;behavioral economics;bone;cancer care;care delivery;care outcomes;chemotherapy;clinical research site;comparative;compliance behavior;effectiveness outcome;evidence base;heuristics;high reward;implementation determinants;implementation outcomes;implementation science;implementation strategy;improved;improved outcome;infancy;innovation;insight;lens;malignant breast neoplasm;multidisciplinary;next generation;novel;programs;research to practice;shift work;skeletal;success;symptom management;synergism;tool;treatment as usual;uptake	UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	Rinad Sary Beidas,Justin  Bekelman,Robert A Schnoll	DCCPS	Cynthia  Vinson	985840	$750k to $999k	985840	2-Aug-2021	1-Aug-2020	31-Jul-2025	RFA-CA-19-006	Moonshot

Further advances in therapy will require a detailed understanding of the molecular underpinnings of T- ALL development and relapse. To this end, I have completed a highly innovative screen in zebrafish to identify genes associated with T-ALL progression and have found that the protein tyrosine phosphotase PRL-3 was commonly amplified in single T-ALL cells as they developed increased ability to form relapse over time. In transgenic animals, PRL-3 over-expression significantly enhanced primary T-ALL development and relapse formation. I have found that PRL-3 amplified in a subset of human T-ALL and is highly expressed by a majority of T-ALL patient samples. These cells are also sensitive to PRL-3 knock-down through the induction of apoptosis. These results imply that PRL-3 activity has an important role in T-ALL malignancy, and that PRL-3 and its substrates may represent novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of T-ALL. The objectives of this proposal are to 1) define the contribution of PRL-3 to T- ALL progression and relapse and 2) identify the mechanism by which PRL-3 drives T-ALL malignancy. This objective will be achieved through two specific aims. During the K99 phase of this award, I will complete Aim 1, where I will examine the effect of PRL-3 gain-of-function and loss-of-function in various stages of T-ALL development in zebrafish, including invasion from the thymus, intravasation, proliferation and relapse, and I will also test the effects of PRL-3 knock-down on human cells in a murine xenograft model. During this phase, I will learn techniques to directly image cancer progression in live animals and to develop orthotopic leukemia xenografts in mice. With this knowledge in hand, during the R00 phase I will complete Aim 2, where I will identify the target substrates of PRL-3 in T-ALL cells, and test the contribution of these genes and pathways to T-ALL malignancy using in vivo and in vitro epistasis experiments. In total, this work will lay the foundation for the development of small molecule PRL-3 and pathway inhibitors for potential therapeutic use in T-ALL. The mentored phase of this award will occur under the guidance of Dr. David Langenau, an expert in zebrafish models of cancer, and Dr. Thomas Look, an internationally recognized leader in the field of leukemia research. Their proven track record of mentorship, coupled with an intensive didactic component and the rigorous and nurturing academic environment offered by the research community of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School offer the best opportunity for my success as I transition to becoming an independent investigator.

ADAM10 was shown to be quite important in humoral immune function. Mice in which their B cells lack ADAM10 (ADAM10B-/-) had defective lymphoid architecture. We will examine whether multiple antigen injections can overcome the defects seen. Newly data indicates that B cell TNF production is responsible for the altered germinal center architecture seen in the ADAM10B-/- mice and that this is due to increased expression of the TNF sheddase ADAM17. The opposite effects for ADAM10 will also be examined, namely what happens when ADAM10 is overexpressed in B cells. Early overexpression in hematopoietic stem cells was shown to block B cell production in the current funding period. Incorporation of a floxxed stop site in fron of the ADAM10 will allow delay of the overexpression until B cells develop. In addition, the ADAM17B-/- mouse should also have elevated ADAM10 expression and enhanced Ig production. Of particular interest is IgE production and we hypothesize that elevated IgE production will correlate with elevated B cell ADAM10. With respect to ADAM10 targets important in B cell function, based on preliminary data, we will concentrate on two substrates, CD23 and fractalkine. Finally, we will examine whether B cell exosomes play a role in the immunostimulatory activity of IgE-antigen complexes. In the second aim, mice with elevated B cell ADAM10 will be examined for enhanced lung inflammation in mouse asthma models and the effect of ADAM10 inhibitors will be examined to determine if this mechanism is solely ADAM10 related. The effect of ADAM10 inhibitors on the lymphoid architecture of the bronchial associated lymphoid tissues will be determined. Using IgE reporter mice, we will specifically determine the effect of ADAM10 inhibitors and ADAM10B-/- mice for germinal center and IgE plasma cell levels. We anticipate that when ADAM10 levels are inhibited we can specifically inhibit the IgE response. Using a model we have developed for suppression of an ongoing asthma response, ADAM10 inhibitors will be examined for their capacity to block this response. Mice lacking ADAM10 in their epithelial cells will be studied to determine whether ADAM10 inhibitors are working primarily by their effect on immune cells. Preliminary evidence indicates that a subpopulation of active allergic patients have elevated B cell ADAM10 levels when compared to controls. We will examine if the B cells from these patients have enhanced IgE production, using in vitro B cell stimulation models. Overall, the project will continue studies ino new promising avenues for understanding and harnessing ADAM10 to control the immune response. In addition, these two aims test the hypothesis that the ratio of ADAM10 to ADAM17 is important especially with respect to the allergic phenotype.

project	5R01AI084880-07	R01AI084880	9221950	2017	In vivo behavior of monocytes in resting and inflammatory conditions	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Macrophages (MØ) are among the immune system's most important defenders of the body by protecting against infection and injury but they also accelerate numerous diseases. Recent studies indicate that many tissue MØ are generated during embryonic development and maintain themselves in adults in the steady-state. In diseased tissues, however, many MØ originate from circulating monocytes (Mo). For example, we found that circulating Mo often inﬁltrate the ischemic myocardium, atherosclerotic plaques and growing tumors, where they differentiate into MØ and can promote disease. These circulating Mo can be released in large quantities from different reservoir locations, including th bone marrow and spleen, and various diseases enhance Mo production in these reservoirs by amplifying hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) locally. At present, an accurate understanding of disease-induced MØ responses is lacking and requires a more comprehensive analysis of the origins and dynamics of these cells at the organismal level. The research proposed in this application will deﬁne both the quantity and quality of tissue MØ based on thei origins. We propose that, in disease, distinct anatomical sites produce different types of MØ precursors and we will thus test the hypothesis that disease-associated tissue MØ responses can be tailored by manipulating these cells' topo-ontogenic sources. First, by taking the entire HSPC➝Mo➝MØ lineage into account we will identify the most important kinetic processes that deﬁne the quantity of disease-associated MØ (aim 1). Second, by considering the different origins of these MØ we will uncover maturational pathways that inﬂuence their quality in vivo (aim 2). Our ﬁndings have therapeutic potential because in both aims we will deﬁne how Ang II pathway manipulations control MØ. Ang II is a newly identiﬁed driver of HSPC/Mo/MØ-mediated inﬂammation that is active in a variety of diseases (cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction) and can be targeted with FDA-approved drugs. Our goal is to develop new advances that can be used to restrain unwanted inﬂammatory reactions or instead promote delivery of protective immunity to tissue.

Recent studies indicate that many tissue MØ are generated during embryonic development and maintain themselves in adults in the steady-state. In diseased tissues, however, many MØ originate from circulating monocytes (Mo). For example, we found that circulating Mo often inﬁltrate the ischemic myocardium, atherosclerotic plaques and growing tumors, where they differentiate into MØ and can promote disease. These circulating Mo can be released in large quantities from different reservoir locations, including th bone marrow and spleen, and various diseases enhance Mo production in these reservoirs by amplifying hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) locally. At present, an accurate understanding of disease-induced MØ responses is lacking and requires a more comprehensive analysis of the origins and dynamics of these cells at the organismal level. The research proposed in this application will deﬁne both the quantity and quality of tissue MØ based on thei origins. We propose that, in disease, distinct anatomical sites produce different types of MØ precursors and we will thus test the hypothesis that disease-associated tissue MØ responses can be tailored by manipulating these cells' topo-ontogenic sources. First, by taking the entire HSPC➝Mo➝MØ lineage into account we will identify the most important kinetic processes that deﬁne the quantity of disease-associated MØ (aim 1). Second, by considering the different origins of these MØ we will uncover maturational pathways that inﬂuence their quality in vivo (aim 2). Our ﬁndings have therapeutic potential because in both aims we will deﬁne how Ang II pathway manipulations control MØ.

This DC population migrates to lymph nodes to induce adaptive immune responses and is notably proficient in cross-presentation of exogenous antigen to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Because of their tissue residence and function, CD103+ DCs are perfectly situated to regulate immune responses to tumors. However, little is understood about their role in cancer. CD103+ DCs are homologous to human tissue CD141+ DCs and DCs generated in GM-CSF for cancer therapy, and provide a genetically tractable system to understand these important DC populations. Recently, our lab and others found CD103+ DCs have a unique developmental pathway dependent on the cytokine GM-CSF, the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT5 and the transcriptional regulator Id2. This signaling pathway correlates with enhanced DC-mediated tumor immunity. By contrast, we found that the tumor-associated cytokine IL-6 represses Id2 expression in DCs via STAT3 signaling, rendering reduced DC-mediated tumor immunity. The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which STAT5 and STAT3 control CD103+ DC functional responses remain unclear. These gaps in knowledge are important to address to provide better use of DCs in immunotherapy. Based on our data, we hypothesize that GM-CSF-STAT5 and IL-6-STAT3 signaling have opposite roles in regulating DC anti-tumor activity via their control of Id2 expression in DCs. We will test this hypothesis wit 3 project aims. In Aim 1, we will delineate mechanisms by which tissue- resident DCs stimulate anti-tumor immunity by investigating the roles for STAT5 and its target gene Id2 in CD103+ DCs. We will study whether and how STAT5 and Id2 control CD103+ DC maturation, antigen presentation, T lymphocyte stimulation, pre-DC accrual in nonlymphoid tissue, and DC-mediated anti-tumor activity. In Aim 2, we will elucidate DC-intrinsic signaling mechanisms that regulate DC function in melanoma tumors. We will investigate roles for STAT3 in DCs in Id2 downregulation, immune responses to melanoma and melanoma combination immunotherapy. In Aim 3, we will examine mechanisms by which STAT5 and STAT3 regulate Id2 expression in DC development. We will evaluate whether and how STAT5 and STAT3 control chromatin modifications, co-factor recruitment and RNA polymerase II association at the Id2 promoter in vivo. We anticipate this project to reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CD103+ DC anti-tumor activity is regulated, paving the way for rational investigation into pathways controlling related human DC populations. This information could ultimately provide new opportunities to manipulate DCs in cellular therapy, cancer and/or immune disease.

While multiple genetic loci affect susceptibility, in most cases\neach in isolation has only a small effect, suggesting that disease develops only when multiple risk-conferring\nalleles that function in concert are inherited by a single individual. We hypothesize that such a situation exists\nin autoreactive B cells where multiple SLE risk alleles encode molecules that appear to function in signaling\npathways that function normally to limit/terminate antigen receptor signaling. In this application we propose to\ntest this hypothesis, analyzing the functional interplay of this set of genes/protein and their risk conferring\nalleles. Future development and implementation of “precision” medical approaches for treatment of\nautoimmunity will require an understanding of the mechanisms by which genetic variations conspire to\nincrease disease risk, and research proposed here represents a critical first step to enable these efforts.\nA number of autoimmunity risk alleles encode molecules previously proposed to function as intermediaries in\nsignaling pathways involved in regulation of B cell activation. As such they may be important in keeping\nautoreactive B cells from becoming activated and contributing to autoimmunity. In this application we request\nsupport to define the functions and functional interactions of proteins encoded by six genes, variants of which\nconfer increased risk of autoimmunity. Previous reports indicate that B cell-targeted deletion of genes encoding\nSHIP-1, PTEN, SHP-1 or LYN, expression of PTPN22 (PEP-R619W), or increased expression of CSK,\npromote the development of autoimmunity. However the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. We\nhypothesize that these proteins function as intermediaries in a bifurcating pathway in which final effectors are\nthe inositol lipid phosphatases SHIP-1 and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. Further, we suggest that both\nterminal effectors are required for maintenance of antigen unresponsiveness of anergic B cells. The studies will\nemploy reductionist genetic models in which risk allele mimetic changes in expression/function of the proteins\ncan be induced acutely in anergic B cells, and subsequent cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and\nautoantibody production monitored. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that PTPN22, CSK and LYN act in linear\npathways upstream of SHIP-1 and SHP-1, and that genetic variations that confer risk compromise anergy by\nundermining their regulatory function. Aim 2 will define the downstream consequences of acute introduction of\nrisk allele mimetic conditions in terms of development of autoimmune disease, and will test candidate\ntherapeutic kinase inhibitors. Aim 3 will translate findings, examining the role of SHIP-1 and SHP-1\nphosphatases in maintenance anergy of human B cells. Proposed studies will provide important new insight\nregarding the in vivo lifestyle of autoreactive B cells whose anergy is compromised by autoimmunity risk alleles.

project	5R01AR050026-13	R01AR050026	9487148	2018	Inflammation and Cardiovascular Disease in Rheumatoid Arthritis	Grant	ABSTRACT\nIndividuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at 50% greater risk for developing heart failure (HF) and HF-\nassociated morbidity and mortality than non-RA controls. This risk persists even after adjustment for coronary\nartery disease, implying that immunologic and inflammatory factors intrinsic to RA contribute to the increased\nrisk of HF. Our overall hypothesis is that myocardial inflammation and microvascular ischemia are prevalent in\nRA patients, are mediated by antibodies to myocardial citrullinated proteins, promote impairment of left\nventricular (LV) structure/function, and are attenuated with RA therapies. Indeed, in 128 RA patients without\nclinical CVD who underwent [18fluoro-deoxyglucose] positron emission-computed tomography (FDG PET-CT)\n(the RHYTHM study), we observed FDG uptake (inflammation) in 35% and impaired myocardial blood flow\nreserve (MFR) in 29%. Both myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR were strongly associated with clinical\nand laboratory measures of RA disease activity; impaired MFR was also associated with higher LV mass, a\nknown precursor of HF. These data suggest that myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR mediate, in part,\nearly changes in LV structure/function that predate clinical HF; but it is critical to confirm these relationships in\nlongitudinal studies. Proximal events that mediate myocardial pathology in RA are unknown. We hypothesize\nthat antibodies against citrullinated myocardial proteins (APCAs) mediate, in part, this abnormal myocardial\nphenotype (inflammation and impaired MFR), leading to myocardial remodeling and ultimately to functional\ndecline. Our preliminary data demonstrating seroreactivity in 30% of RHYTHM sera in a novel myocardial\nprotein array support this hypothesis. A related question is whether tumor necrosis inhibitors (TNFi’s) affect\nmyocardial inflammation. This is a far from insignificant question as TNFi’s were associated with increased HF\nhospitalizations and death in non-RA HF patients and their risk for HF in RA is still unclear despite widespread\nuse. In the next funding period, we seek to extend the study period for the RHYTHM cohort for aims 1 and 3,\nand to utilize an independently funded study (TARGET) for aim 2, in order to investigate the following aims:\n1) To determine if imaging indicators of myocardial pathology at baseline (inflammation, impaired\nMFR) are predictive of longitudinal (adverse) change in measures of LV structure and function over 4-6\nyears in RA patients without clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline.\n2) To determine, in a currently enrolling NIH-NIAMS funded randomized clinical trial (the TARGET\nstudy), if RA therapies reduce myocardial inflammation.\n3) To determine if seroreactivity to citrullinated myocardial antigens in RHYTHM participants is\nassociated with baseline myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR and/or with change over time in\nparameters of LV structure/function. These investigations will advance understanding of mechanisms that\ncontribute to and mitigate increased risk of myocardial dysfunction in RA.

The dendritic cell (DC) is a specialized immune sentinel that directs T cells to\ntolerance or immunity. DC comprise a rich network in skin consisting of several different\npopulations, but are understudied, leaving a major gap in therapeutic intervention. We have\nidentified distinct properties for DC in skin that relay information by migrating out to the draining\nlymph node (LN). We find during inflammation skin migratory DC may direct T cells to tolerance\nby unknown mechanisms, counter-regulating and controlling immunity. These cells are uniquely\ngenetically programed in humans and in mouse to dampen immunity with a high expression of\nshared tolerance genes, including some genes such as PD-L1 that have been successfully\ntargeted in the clinic for peripheral tissue cancers including melanoma skin cancer, colorectal\ncancer and lung cancer. We hypothesize homeostatic programming of skin DC leads to failed\nimmune priming leading to impaired early detection of skin cancers. We find these pathways are\nof great importance as therapeutic targets to promote self-tolerance (such as during\nautoimmune disease) or to block tolerance (to improve immunity during cancer). Because these\nmechanisms are distinct they can be combined with current modalities for patients in\nimmunotherapy of skin cancer, vaccine science, and inflammatory skin disease. In 2 discrete\naims, this application will address programmatic conditioning of skin DCs and the unique cellular\nmechanisms by which they promote immune tolerance in both mice and humans, examining\nconsequences during immune priming and early skin cancer growth.

project	5R01CA099326-23	R01CA099326	9263886	2017	Large heat shock proteins and their role in cancer therapy	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New strategies which improve the efficacy of radiation therapy and/or protect surrounding normal tissue from damage can have a major impact on treatment outcome. Recent studies have reinvigorated the hypothesis that the outcome of radiation therapy is dependent upon the anti-tumor immune response and strongly support the testing of new combinations of ionizing radiation with immunotherapy. Heat shock protein (HSP) biology has been central to our research for many years. This work led to a completely new vaccine paradigm based upon the chaperone potential of large HSPs (first discovered by our group) and their ability to stimulate powerful anti-tumor immunity. Large HSPs, including hsp110 and the glucose regulated protein 170 (grp170) are related molecular chaperones that are highly efficient in binding to large substrate proteins. Our team has demonstrated that clinically relevant tumor antigens (e.g., gp100, HER- 2/neu, etc.) can be complexed to these large stress-response proteins by heat shock generating a highly effective antigen-specific, immune response. In a significant demonstration of lab bench-to-bedside research, our preclinical results led to a successful RAID application from the NCI for the development of a novel hsp110-based vaccine now undergoing Phase I evaluation in advanced melanoma patients. In new preliminary and published data, we have discovered that grp170 and pathogen-associated molecules (PAMPs) can act synergistically to stimulate the innate immune response and this is dependent on the chaperoning activity of grp170. We believe that this discovery can result in a novel, multipronged approach to cancer therapy. Therefore, we have engineered a chimeric chaperone, termed Flagrp170, by fusing a truncated grp170 chaperone with bacterial flagellin-derived PAMP which has an NF-kB-activating domain. Since preliminary data show a strong potential for Flagrp170 to provide a radioprotective effect, we hypothesize that this novel agent could both enhance therapeutic responsiveness to ionizing radiation (through enhanced immune responses of the vaccine) and provide critical protection of normal tissue. We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we predict that this chaperoning competent chimeric macromolecule can preferentially deliver selected antigens to specialized antigen-presenting cells and concurrently stimulate the NF-kB signaling for their functional activation. In Aim 2, we will test whether vaccination with Flagrp170 complexed with tumor antigen will generate a more potent and durable immune response than unmodified grp170. In Aim 3, the potential of using Flagrp170 to improve efficacy of ionizing radiation and provide tissue protection against radio-toxicity will be investigated. Successful completion of proposed research will not only provide a better understanding of the multifunctional features of the chimeric chaperone, but will also establish a scientific rationale for design the new generation of HSP-based vaccines to be used alone or in conjunction with the standard-of-care therapies (e.g., radiotherapy) in future clinical trials.

Recent reports on the efficacy of therapeutic agents targeting the most common alteration in melanoma, mutant BRAF, have been very encouraging and have shifted the treatment paradigm for this disease. Despite these impressive clinical successes, a significant percentage of patients are intrinsically\nresistant to BRAF inhibitors and those who initially respond ultimately relapse as a result of acquired resistance. In addition, nearly half of all melanomas contain wild-type BRAF and are therefore not sensitive to mutant BRAF inhibitors. While targeted therapies have the potential to revolutionize cancer care by providing personalized treatment strategies that are less toxic and more effective, maximizing their effectiveness requires increased knowledge of the molecular alterations that drive tumor formation, progression, maintenance, and resistance. In vivo models fulfill this need. We have developed a novel mouse model of melanoma that not only aids in the identification and validation of alterations that drive tumor growth but also provides a means to assess tumor progression and efficacy of therapeutic strategies. Importantly, melanomas can be induced in our model using the same genetic alterations observed in the human disease and specific gene combinations result in both lung and brain metastases, which are responsible for nearly half of all melanoma patient deaths. We have observed that despite their high sequence and functional similarity, AKT2 and AKT3 significantly differ in their ability to promote brain metastases in the context of mutant BRAF in vivo. Interestingly, brain metastases are also not observed in mice with mutant BRAF-driven tumors that lack Pten, which is believed to contribute to melanoma development and progression through deregulated AKT activity. We are uniquely poised to investigate the mechanistic differences between these tumors in vivo using our novel mouse model. We hypothesize that the differential ability of the three AKT isoforms and Pten loss to induce brain metastases is due to differential downstream signaling and that genetic suppression of AKT3 in this context will significantly delay the development and growth of distant metastases. To test this hypothesis, we will define the functional domain(s) that dictate AKT isoform specific melanoma brain metastases in vivo, use functional proteomics to identify AKT3-dependent effectors involved in promoting brain metastases, and utilize an in vivo genetic approach to evaluate the effect of targeting AKT3 on melanoma growth and metastasis. We will further validate our findings in melanoma tissue from patients. The long-term goals of this project are to identify targets that promote brain metastases as well as biomarkers that identify the subset of melanoma patients that are most likely to develop brain metastases and would therefore benefit from more aggressive therapy.

project	5R01CA121118-12	R01CA121118	10307118	2022	A High-Throughput Model for Human Melanoma	Grant	Significant advances in melanoma research have resulted in new therapies that have remarkably improved the\nmanagement and overall survival of melanoma. However, many patients still succumb to the disease and more\nthan half of all melanoma deaths are due to brain metastases. As a means to overcome this challenge, we\ndeveloped a novel mouse model that allows postnatal delivery of genes of interest to melanocytes. Using\ngenomic and proteomic data from human melanoma samples, we tested several gene combinations for their\nability to induce metastatic melanoma in vivo. Hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the context of mutant\nBRAF and CDKN2A loss resulted in the development of spontaneous melanoma with full penetrance and a\nmean survival of only 6 weeks. The majority of these mice also developed multiple metastases to the lungs and\nbrain. This model mimics the human disease genetically, histologically, and by sites of metastasis. Importantly,\nthis model system provides a powerful platform to further study the mechanisms of melanoma metastasis.\nElucidation of this network will allow the identification of key pathway nodes that represent potential therapeutic\ntargets to disrupt this process. We used next generation sequencing and proteomics analysis of non-metastatic\nand metastatic tumor samples to identify downstream targets of AKT1 implicated in melanoma brain metastasis.\nOur data showed that tumors expressing activated AKT1 displayed elevated levels of focal adhesion (FA) factors\nand phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (P-FAK). In addition, mutant AKT1 expression increased invasion and\nthis was reduced by pharmacological inhibition of either AKT or FAK. Moreover, loss of PTEN, which also results\nin increased FAK activity, cooperated with activated AKT1 to further enhance brain metastasis in vivo. Despite\nthese promising preliminary findings, a critical gap still remains in understanding whether and how FAK promotes\nmelanoma brain metastasis, and whether the AKT1-FAK-PTEN axis can be exploited as a therapeutic target in\nthis disease. Our long-term goal is to use this knowledge to develop novel melanoma therapies and improve\npatient outcomes. Pursuant to this goal, we have generated a diverse collection of state-of-the-art research tools\nand assembled a talented team of scientists and clinicians with a track record of productive collaboration to carry\nout and critically evaluate the results of the proposed aims. Using these unique resources, we propose to test\nthe following hypotheses: 1) AKT1→ FAK signaling is essential for the development of melanoma brain\nmetastases; 2) Combined inhibition of BRAFV600E, MEK, and FAK is superior to standard of care targeted therapy\nand; 3) Loss of PTEN expression results in sustained FAK phosphorylation, which enhances the development\nof melanoma brain metastases. Successful completion of the aims in this proposal will significantly impact the\nfield by laying the groundwork for translation into clinical trials, leading to new and better treatments for patients\nwith brain metastases and those who are at high risk of developing brain metastases.

project	5R01CA124633-10	R01CA124633	9263888	2017	Pathogenesis and Treatment of NUT-Midline Carcinoma	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this project is a rare, highly aggressive, and incurable subtype of squamous cell carcinoma, genetically defined by rearrangement of the NUT gene, and termed midline carcinoma (NMC). The goals of the enclosed proposal are 1) to determine the pathogenesis and 2) effective therapy of NMC.  NMC is characterized by a simple karyotype harboring a single translocation involving the NUT gene with members of the bromodomain-containing BET family, most commonly BRD3 or BRD4. The resultant BRD- NUT fusion protein is causative in this cancer, acting to block differentiation and maintain NMC cells in a perpetually proliferative state. Several pieces of evidence have led us formulate a model whereby BRD-NUT blocks differentiation by sequestering chromatin "writers" necessary for transcription, such as histone acetyl- transferases (HATs), away from genes required for differentiation to limited genomic regions where the bromodomains of BRD "read" and activate transcription of pro-growth, anti-differentiative genes. Indeed, drug inhibitors of the acetyl-histone binding bromodomains (BETi) or of histone deacetylases unblock the BRD-NUT induced blockade on differentiation, resulting in differentiation and arrested proliferation of NMC\ncells in vitro and in vivo. Both approaches have been used therapeutically in patients.  In support of the above model, recent findings indicate that the transcriptional upregulation of the common cancer gene, MYC, by BRD4-NUT is required and can replace BRD4-NUT's function to block differentiation.  The first aim, to identify the molecular mechanisms by which BRD4-NUT leads to the MYC-dependent blockade of differentiation in NMC cells, will be accomplished by isolating and sequencing genes with which BRD4-NUT associates, and correlating with changes that occur in expression of those genes under conditions which promote differentiation in NMC cells. The gene targets of BRD4-NUT identified in these studies will be correlated with findings acquired from the genome-wide siRNA knockdown, which will identify specific genes whose expression is required for the blockade of differentiation in NMC cells. After a list of key target genes is identified and prioritized based on pathway analysis, they will be tested for their\neffects on MYC protein and RNA levels to identify which BRD4-NUT target genes are required to upregulate MYC levels. In addition, identification of BRD4-NUT-containing protein complexes by mass-spectrometry will be performed to identify proteins which collaborate with BRD4-NUT to upregulate MYC.  The second aim, an exploratory aim, to identify mutations in NMC cells that collaborate with BRD4-NUT in the blockade of differentiation and maintenance of growth of NMC cells, will be accomplished by sequencing all coding genes of approximately ten NMC tumors. The purpose of this aim is also to identify mutant proteins which aid BRD4-NUT oncogenic activity that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors in the treatment of NMC.

NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), with a median survival of 6.7 months, is one of\nthe most aggressive solid tumors known. It is a subtype of squamous cell carcinoma characterized by\ntranslocation of the NUT (aka NUTM1) gene, most commonly forming a fusion to the double-bromodomain\nencoding protein (BET), BRD4. There is an urgent need for the identification of more specific therapeutic\ntargets in NMC. The over-reaching goal of this proposed project is to greater understand the mechanism of\nBRD4-NUT oncogenesis and identify effective therapeutic targets for treating this disease.\n BRD4-NUT functions to block differentiation and maintain proliferation of NMC cells, largely through\nactivation of MYC expression. This function is disrupted upon treatment with BET inhibitors, which as acetyl-\nlysine mimetics prevent binding of BRD4 bromodomains to acetylated chromatin. BRD4-NUT drives the\nexpression of pro-growth target genes, including MYC, through the formation of megabase-sized massive\nhyperacetylated 'megadomains'. BRD4-NUT megadomains arise from pre-existing active enhancers and\nspread to fill cell-type-specific topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are higher order genomic\nstructures whose function is to orchestrate cell-fate determining transcriptional programs through DNA-DNA\ncontacts. Unique proteins recruited by BRD4-NUT recently identified by our group include the histone acetyl-\ntransferase (HAT), p300, and several ZNF proteins collectively termed Z4. These findings indicate that BRD4-\nNUT ‘hijacks’ cell-type specific TADs to drive transcription of pro-growth, anti-differentiative genes as\npostulated in the following model: First, BRD4-NUT complex proteins seed regions corresponding to cell-type-\nspecific active TADs through the chromatin-binding of BRD4. Second, megadomains form from contiguous\nexpansion of BRD4-NUT complexes across chromatin in a feed-forward manner dependent upon p300 HAT\nactivity. Third, megadomain size is limited by TAD boundaries and HDAC activity recruited by the Z4 complex.\nFourth, hyperacetylated chromatin, recruitment of chromatin remodelers, and upregulation of cis lncRNAs\nchanges the chromatin configuration to enhance DNA-DNA interactions to drive transcription of key pro-\ngrowth, anti-differentiative genes.

Despite the grim clinical picture, cancer genetics has revealed that lung cancers can be divided into genetically-defined subsets based on driver oncogene mutations that, in turn, serve as predictive biomarkers for the clinical deployment of new first-line pathway-targeted therapies in lung cancer patients. However, to date, only a minority of such patients have benefitted from these advances such that treatment options for most patients remain poor and are limited to conventional approaches including surgery, radiation, and/or conventional chemotherapy that are ineffective against tumor cells and toxic to normal cells. The overarching, long-term goal of this research is to aid the deployment of rational, evidence-based therapeutic strategies to treat lung cancer patients. However, the immediate objectives of this proposal are to mechanistically define how parallel pathways, such as WNT→ß-catenin→c-MYC or PI3'-kinase→PDK→AKT signaling, cooperate with oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer. To do so we will use: State-of-the-art genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer; Lung cancer- derived cell lines whose aberrant behavior is driven by relevant genetic abnormalities; Pathway-targeted therapeutics, many of which are in cancer clinical trials and one of which is specifically being tested in lung cancer and; An innovative transposon mutagenesis system to simultaneously elicit lung cancer progression and identify its underlying genetic cause. Building on a solid foundation of studies published in the previous cycle of this grant, in Aim 1 we will identify the tumor cell autonomous mechanisms by which WNT→ß-catenin signaling cooperates with oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer. In Aim 2 we will explore the mechanisms by which PI3'-kinase signaling promotes the proliferative expansion and maintenance of both early- and late-stage BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors. BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors remain uniformly benign unless cooperating genomic events unleash malignant progression. In Aim 3 document the use of Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis to promote progression of BRAFV600E- driven lung cancers. Genetic progression factors identified will be validated using lentivirus-mediated cDNA expression or by in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tumor suppressor gene silencing in the mouse lung. Moreover, we will mine the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma genome, RNA sequencing and RPPA databases to credential genes implicated in our SB screen in mice as being directly relevant to bona fide human lung cancer. Finally, although this proposal is focused primarily on studies of genetic cooperation in the genesis of lung cancer, we will test the anti-tumor effects of novel pathway-targeted inhibitors of BRAFV600E, WNT or PI3'- kinase signaling that are likely to have important translational implications for the design and evaluation of new pathway-targeted strategies to treat patients with this ubiquitous, devastating and poorly understood disease.	1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase;Acyltransferase;Address;Alleles;Apoptosis;Behavior;Benign;Biochemistry;Biological Models;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Patient;Cell Cycle;Cell Line;Cellular biology;Cessation of life;Clinical;DNA Sequence Alteration;Databases;Dependency;Development;Disease;Disease Resistance;Dissociation;Drug resistance;Evaluation;Event;Experimental Models;Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinases;Foundations;Future;Gene Silencing;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Growth;Human;In Vitro;Investigation;Lesion;Ligands;Lipids;Lung;Lung Adenocarcinoma;Lung Neoplasms;MEKs;Maintenance;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Mediating;Minority;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Molecular Mechanisms of Action;Mus;Mutagenesis;Mutation;Normal Cell;Oncogene Activation;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;PDPK1 gene;PI3 gene;PTEN gene;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Phase;Physicians;Play;Porcupines;Prognostic Marker;Protein Array Analysis;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Publishing;Radiation;Research;Resources;Risk stratification;Role;Scientist;Scourge;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Sleeping Beauty;Solid;Specimen;Subfamily lentivirinae;System;Talents;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Therapeutic;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Ursidae Family;Validation;WNT Signaling Pathway;X-Ray Computed Tomography;antitumor effect;base;beta catenin;c-myc Genes;cDNA Expression;cancer clinical trial;cancer genetics;cancer initiation;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;design;evidence base;experimental study;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;lung carcinogenesis;lung tumorigenesis;mouse model;neoplastic cell;novel;predictive marker;public health relevance;response;senescence;statistics;targeted treatment;tool;transcriptome sequencing;translational cancer research;tumor;tumor progression	UNIVERSITY OF UTAH	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	UNITED STATES	MARTIN  MCMAHON	DCB	Joanna M.

This project has discovered suppressors of bladder tumor growth and metastasis and shown that low expression of AGL, an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis, and RhoGDI2, an inhibitor of multiple GTPases, is associated with cancer recurrence and death. The Goal of this continuation project is to understand how reduced AGL levels result in aggressive bladder cancer and to translate this knowledge into novel therapies. We found bladder cancer cells with low AGL express elevated levels of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) synthase 2 (HAS2), and its extracellular product HA, and have activated RhoC and Rac1, known drivers of tumor progression. We demonstrated RhoC/Rac1 activity is suppressed by RhoGDI2, linking the actions of the two metastasis suppressors. Cells with low AGL also exhibit increased glycolysis, glucose import and autophagy. When either glucose import or autophagy are blocked, low AGL tumor cells show greater reduction of in vitro growth than cells with higher AGL levels, exposing a vulnerability of these aggressive cells. These data support an innovative Hypothesis: Tumor cells with low AGL generate growth and metastatic signals via production of HA, activation of its receptors CD44 and RHAMM, and downstream effectors such as RhoC and Rac1. For these signals to be actualized, sufficient energy needs to be provided via enhanced glucose import and autophagy. Three Specific Aims will test this hypothesis. 1) Evaluate impact of HA signaling on aggressiveness of bladder cancers with low AGL. We will determine if HA drives tumor progression via its receptors CD44 and RHAMM and effectors RhoC and Rac1 that are inhibited by RhoGDI2. Experiments will use RNAi and receptor inhibition in human xenografts. 2) Determine role of the AGL signaling network in bladder cancer development and progression. We will evaluate the independent predictive value of tumor suppressor genes and components of the AGL signaling network in a large panel of annotated human tumors, to define a predictive multigene biomarker signature and possible new therapeutic targets. We will use full and conditional (bladder urothelium) AGL knockout mice in a chemical carcinogenesis model that generates spontaneous visceral metastases to test whether lack of AGL makes urothelium more susceptible to carcinogenesis and resulting tumors more aggressive. 3) Target molecular vulnerabilities of bladder cancers with low AGL expression. Here we test whether blocking glucose import and/or autophagy reduces in vivo bladder tumor growth. We will use shRNA and pharmacologic agents already in preclinical/clinical testing. We will screen shRNA libraries to metabolic and autophagy genes in cells with low AGL to discover novel genes essential to the aggressive tumor phenotype, with the expectation that some of these will become therapeutic targets. We will evaluate combined inhibition of HA signaling and energy production pathways with the expectation this will have synergistic detrimental effects on tumor progression. Impact: This project will lay the foundation for future biomarker-driven personalized clinical trials that target critical vulnerabilities in bldder cancer while informing us on how AGL executes its unanticipated role in cancer.

We aim to understand mechanisms underlying\noncogenic signaling and drug resistance in melanoma in order to improve the current treatment\noptions. The serine/threonine kinase, BRAF, is somatically mutated in ~50% of melanomas and\ndrives hyper-activation of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling, aberrant growth and invasion. While BRAF and\nMEK inhibitors are now first-line therapy for advanced-stage mutant V600E BRAF melanomas,\nthey only delay mortality. Thus, we must understand how to build on BRAF+MEK inhibitor\ntreatments and determine how to combine them with immune checkpoint agents, which remove the\nblocks on T cell action. In the previous cycle of this grant, we showed that up-regulation of FOXD3-\nErbB3 signaling is an adaptive response to BRAF inhibitors that promotes a state of drug tolerance\nin mutant BRAF melanoma.

project	5R01CA175397-05	R01CA175397	9331455	2017	Cancer-associated fibroblast in the regulation of bladder cancer stem cells	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer, the fifth most common malignancy in the U.S. with approximately 70,000 new cases diagnosed each year, is essentially incurable after it has begun to progress. Much of the difficulty lies in the scarcity of mechanistic insightsin the functional involvement of the fibroblastic microenvironment, and its interactions with the epithelial cancer compartment in modulating early bladder cancer invasion. The applicant and his collaborators have made considerable strides in closing this gap. They were among the first to isolate and characterize human bladder cancer stem cells.  Recently, they showed that an expansion of phenotypic cancer stem cells correlates with a poorer clinical outcome and bladder cancer invasion.  Their proposal aims to extend these findings by elucidating the functional contribution of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the modulation of bladder cancer stem cells and tumor progression. This application has its foundation via demonstrating that bladder cancer patients with an elevated expression of CAF genes also have muscle-invasive cancer and a poorer survival.  Moreover, activated CAFs localize immediately adjacent to phenotypic cancer stem cells, suggesting a possible functional interaction between these two cell types.  Additional findings indicate an important role of collagen I (COL1) excreted by CAFs, which can bind to discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (DDR1) on bladder cancer cells and modulate their tumorigenic properties.  This progress has led to a novel working hypothesis - that COL1-DDR1 signaling between activated CAFs and bladder cancer cells is one of the mechanisms exerted by CAFs to regulate cancer stem cells and tumor progression. Three specific research aims will be pursued.  Aim 1 seeks to establish the functional involvement of CAFs in the regulation of cancer stem cells and tumor progression, with an emphasis on using primary patient specimens.  To further define the clinical significance of CAFs, we will utilize tw independent patient cohorts to assess the expression of CAFs/COL1 in relation to bladder cancer differentiation and selected clinical prognostic information.  Aim 2 will employ both gain-of-function and loss-of-function strategies to define the functional contributions of DDR1 on bladder cancer cells to mediate the biological properties promoted by CAFs.  These studies will be aided by the availability of newly isolated bladder CAFs and the applicant's expertise in isolating cancer stem cells for subsequent analysis. Finally, Aim 3 will access Stat3 and additional downstream mechanisms related to DDR1, using established proteomics profiling approach.  The applicant intends to uncover druggable targets within this pathway for early bladder cancer intervention, as the long-term goal of this proposal.

While the initial steps of\nthe metastatic cascade are rather well defined, identification of targets to block this process remains a major\nclinical challenge. Previous studies have elegantly investigated the mechanistic contribution of tumor cell intrinsic\nproperties that promote metastasis in bladder urothelial carcinomas. However, the functional significance of the\ntumor microenvironment and its contribution to this complicated process is not well characterized, and therefore,\nwarrants investigation. The long-term goal of this renewal application is to continue explore how collagens—a\nmajor extracellular matrix component of the microenvironment—act as a ligand to mediate crosstalk with their\nreceptor on tumor cells to facilitate the metastatic cascade. We will investigate the downstream regulatory\nmechanisms of collagen receptor signaling in both the primary tumor and metastatic sites, and to exploit these\nregulatory processes as a revolutionizing approach to target metastases. Such innovative approaches to perturb\ncollagen-cancer crosstalk—not only at the primary tumor but also at the metastatic niche—will move the field\nforward by providing a new conception in metastatic disease management, and likely extend beyond bladder\ncarcinomas to other cancer types.

project	5R01CA176745-08	R01CA176745	9725920	2019	Targeting DOT1L for Degradation in MLL-rearranged Leukemia	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nDespite marked progress in the rate of cure among patients with acute leukemia, chromosomal translocations\ninvolving the mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL1) give rise to highly aggressive acute leukemias associated\nwith poor clinical outcomes for pediatric and adult patients. Current treatment options are of limited effectiveness;\nthus, there is a pressing need for new therapies for this disease. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the\nhistone methyltransferase DOT1L is required for the development and maintenance of MLL-rearranged (MLL-r)\nleukemia in model systems. Likewise, work from the previous funding cycle clearly defined a role for DOT1L\ninhibition in MLL-r leukemia through characterization of a potent, specific DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ-5676\n(pinometostat), that has remarkably selective anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on MLL-rearranged\ncells. As pinometostat has progressed through Phase I clinical trials, responses and subsequent relapses imply\nthe development of acquired resistance to the inhibitor. In this proposal, we seek to understand the biological\nunderpinnings of DOT1L inhibitor resistance and develop a novel class of small molecule DOT1L degraders to\novercome resistance. In Specific Aim 1, we seek to understand the mechanisms of resistance through detailed\nstudies of chromatin structure and gene expression following the development of acquired resistance to DOT1L\ninhibitor therapy. We will also investigate the non-enzymatic role of DOT1L in MLL-r leukemia and define\ndependencies acquired in the resistant state. In Specific Aim 2, we will lead a chemistry and chemical biology\ncampaign and develop an assay platform for the identification and optimization of the first small molecule\ndegraders of endogenous DOT1L protein. In Specific Aim 3, we will utilize our cell culture and patient-derived\nxenograft models of MLL-r leukemia to explore the impact of DOT1L degradation on gene expression and tumor\nprogression while driving hit-to-lead optimization of DOT1L degraders that can prompt clinical investigation.

Our laboratory has reported in vivo-like IGF- 1R/mTOR expression patterns, closely related to those observed in human Ewing sarcoma tumors (ES), when established ES cell lines are grown upon innovative biologically inert 3D electrospun poly(�-caprolactone) (PCL) microfiber scaffolds rather than upon traditional plastic monolayers. The present proposal seeks to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions stimulate an activated IGF- 1R/mTOR signaling state within this engineered 3D bone tumor microenvironment, as those interactions are critically important in initiating and maintaining ES. In parallel with determining the influence of those parameters under static cell culture, 3D scaffolds and culture conditions will be adapted to better emulate the native bone microenvironment: (a) varied flow perfusion rates will be used to assess the effect of shear stress upon cell retention while facilitating uniform distribution of Ewing cells within the scaffold, (b) PCL scaffolds will incorporate IGF-1 to mimic the high concentration of IGF-1 naturally released as tumors invade surrounding bone, (c) the effect of an osteogenic ECM upon the IGF-1R/mTOR signaling cascade will be determined using decellularized scaffolds upon which heterotypic mesenchymal stem cells, differentiated toward an osteoblastic lineage, are first grown, and (d) ES cells will be co-cultured with endothelial cells (EC) to determine how heterotypic cells interact within a fabricated 3D bone tumor model to elicit viable ES tumors. Finally, to determine the mechanism(s) by which Ewing sarcoma evades sensitivity to combined mTOR/IGF-1R targeted therapy, freshly-derived tumor specimens (obtained from Ewing sarcoma patients treated with Medi- 573/everolimus in an IRB-approved clinical trial), will be grown in primary culture within 3D scaffolds and compared to 2D culture and patient-derived tumor explants (PDTX) by proteomic analysis of the IGF- 1R/mTOR pathway and putative resistance mechanisms. This novel approach of studying Ewing sarcoma within an ex vivo preclinical model of the bone microenvironment presents tremendous potential for understanding chemotherapeutic efficacy and for determining resistance mechanisms to biologically targeted therapies.

Both Mdm2 and Mdmx bind and are direct regulators of the p53 tumor suppressor, but their regulation of p53 activation is only partially understood. Moreover, Mdm2 and Mdmx also have other oncogenic functions that are not well characterized and that likely impact p53 activation and significantly contribute to tumorigenesis. Specifically, altered expression of either Mdm2 or Mdmx can lead to genome instability, which is a hallmark of cancer and facilitator of tumor development; however, the mechanisms for this remain unresolved and appear to have both p53-dependent and p53-independent components. Preliminary data suggest novel mechanisms of Mdm2 and Mdmx in the regulation of p53 and the DNA damage response. Therefore, we hypothesize that alterations in these functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx significantly contribute to their oncogenic activity that leads to genome instability and tumor development. We propose to investigate this hypothesis with three Specific Aims. Experiments in Aim 1 utilize innovative approaches to define the novel functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx that result in genome instability during tumorigenesis and the proteins and pathways required. Experiments in Aim 2 will evaluate a novel mechanism of p53 regulation by Mdm2 and Mdmx with multiple approaches, including a new mouse model. Experiments in Aim 3 will capitalize on the novel functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx in targeting an Achilles' heel in cancer cells, and will identify synthetic lethal combination for cells that have lost a functional Mdm2/Mdmx-p53 pathway. Results from these Aims will reveal critical insights into the oncogenic functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx and their roles in tumorigenesis. Our studies should also open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of the 50% of human cancers that have inactivated p53.

project	5R01CA182543-05	R01CA182543	9221976	2017	Biosensor Assay to Screen for Signaling Pathway Inhibition in Cancer	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kinase inhibitors created a new paradigm in chemotherapy and are a major focus of new oncology drug development, but developmental success rates are low (5-10%). Resistance to kinase inhibitors occurs through target-dependent mechanisms (e.g. point mutations that abrogate drug binding) and target-independent mechanisms (e.g. upregulation of alternative signaling pathways, termed "kinome reprogramming"). Therefore, combinations of inhibitors that target several kinases at once are desirable to have a better chance of avoiding the resistance/relapse cycle. Detecting protein kinase activity inside living cells (rather than in lysates or reconstituted systems) is important or understanding kinase inhibitor drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and would lead to better screening for inhibitors likely to make it through the development process. We will develop multiplexed, cell-based assays for specific kinase activities that are important to inhibitor response and kinome reprogramming, and use them to detect kinase activation profiles in patient cells and for inhibitor screens. Phosphorylation of the biosensors is detected using time-resolved lanthanide luminescence measurements, in which Tb3+ emission energy is measured directly via small molecule fluorophores to give different emission colors depending on the fluorophore. In Aim 1, we will establish quantitative assays for activity (and therefore inhibition) of key kinases in drug sensitive and drug resistant CML cells, profiling the pathway activation phenotypes in therapeutically relevant cellular states. We will use the set of biosensors we have already established in preliminary work, and add biosensors for other kinases as they are developed. The assays will be established with cell lines and samples from CML patients (comparing to healthy controls), and validated with RT-qPCR and SWATH" proteomics. In Aim 2, we will screen for synergies between existing kinase inhibitor drugs and new compounds (via libraries). We will also develop homogenous multiplexed analysis of biosensor phosphorylation using energy transfer from lanthanides to organic dyes. In Aim 3, we expand the biosensor design pipeline to develop new, non-natural peptide substrates to use as biosensors for other kinases. The work described in this aim will add to the set of biosensors we already have available. Completion of the work described in this proposal will give us a novel assay for multiple kinases, a suite of new biosensors as well as new and refined detection strategies to use in screening. Drug discovery will benefit from this technology's ability to address kinome reprogramming mechanisms by targeting several kinases at a time. Drug development will benefit from companion assays for multiple targets that could follow a drug or drug combination through the hit to lead transition, target validation, pre-clinical studies, clinial trials, and beyond into treatment management. This assay and its associated tools will contribute to the next generation of targeted therapy development in cancer by breaking new ground in our ability to model the disease environment during drug screening and development.

We will also develop homogenous multiplexed analysis of biosensor phosphorylation using energy transfer from lanthanides to organic dyes. In Aim 3, we expand the biosensor design pipeline to develop new, non-natural peptide substrates to use as biosensors for other kinases. The work described in this aim will add to the set of biosensors we already have available. Completion of the work described in this proposal will give us a novel assay for multiple kinases, a suite of new biosensors as well as new and refined detection strategies to use in screening. Drug discovery will benefit from this technology's ability to address kinome reprogramming mechanisms by targeting several kinases at a time. Drug development will benefit from companion assays for multiple targets that could follow a drug or drug combination through the hit to lead transition, target validation, pre-clinical studies, clinial trials, and beyond into treatment management. This assay and its associated tools will contribute to the next generation of targeted therapy development in cancer by breaking new ground in our ability to model the disease environment during drug screening and development.

project	5R01CA187076-04	R01CA187076	9319538	2017	The role of the PI3K pathway in immune resistance	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple immunotherapies have demonstrated long-term clinical benefit in patients with melanoma. Clinical trials are currently underway to build upon this activity in melanoma, and to see if similar benefits can be achieved in other cancers. Despite the advances made over the last few years, there is currently limited understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy. An improved understanding of resistance may identify patients that are most likely to benefit from current immunotherapies. Further, identification of resistance mechanisms that are targetable may lead to combinations that are more effective. Previously we demonstrated that targeting BRAFV600 mutations, which are the most common somatic alterations in melanoma, increases the efficacy of immune-mediated killing of tumors through multiple mechanisms, leading to ongoing clinical trials. Recently, we have found evidence that loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which occurs in 20-30% of melanomas with BRAFV600 mutations, may also contribute to resistance to immunotherapy. Our preliminary experiments show that loss of PTEN in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells inhibits T-cell mediated killing of melanomas in vitro , decreases intratumoral accumulation of tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) in vivo, and correlates with reduced success of TIL expansion from patients. Our data also demonstrates that loss of PTEN correlates with inferior clinical outcomes among BRAF-mutant melanoma patients, reinforcing the clinical significance of this subpopulation. Loss of PTEN results in marked activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, a pathway for which many targeted agents are available and currently undergoing clinical testing. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the PI3K-AKT pathway in tumor cells is the critical mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy in BRAF-mutant melanomas, and that inhibition of this pathway will increase the efficacy of T-cell mediated immunotherapy. In order to test this hypothesis, we will utilize multiple unique clinical and preclinical resources that we have established to develop\nmore effective therapeutic approaches for melanoma patients. First, we will utilize our preclinical\nmodels and diagnostic platforms to interrogate the mechanisms that underlie resistance to T-cell mediated killing and trafficking of T cells to melanoma with loss of PTEN. Second, we will analyze specimens from several cohorts of melanoma patients to determine the immunological features and immunotherapy treatment outcomes associated with PTEN loss. Finally, we will determine the effects of PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors, alone and in combination with FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors, on T-cell viability, function, and anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vio. Together these studies will improve our understanding of the role and therapeutic potential of the PI3K-AKT pathway in resistance to immunotherapy in melanoma. Further, as the PI3K-AKT pathway is implicated in multiple tumor types in which immunotherapies are being tested, the findings may have broad applications for cancer patients.

project	5R01CA187532-03	R01CA187532	9228985	2017	Imaging Habitats in Sarcoma	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tissue cancers, with over 50 histological sub-types. Regardless of type, virtually all STS are treated the same; i.e. with doxorubicin (DOX) followed by resection, if possible. More than 20% of STS are non-resectable and, of those that are, more than 20% recur. For non-resectable or recurring patients, median survival is a dismal 18 months. Perhaps because of its rarity, no new front-line agents have been developed for STS in decades. Among newer agents being developed for STS, TH-302 is showing exceptional promise. TH-302 is an alkylating pro-drug that is activated only in regions of severe hypoxia, and is currently in a phas III trial in combination with DOX in unresectable STS. The primary endpoint of this trial is overal survival with a secondary endpoint of objective radiological response with RECIST 1.1. RECIST responses rarely correlate with survival responses in soft tissue sarcomas, however. The purpose of this work is to develop MR imaging biomarkers that can predict response to DOX and/or TH-302, with the overarching hypothesis that distinct MRI-defined sub-regions of tumors will have differential responses to these agents. Because these sub-regions are defined by their distinct physiology illuminated by combining multiple MR scans, we have termed these as distinct "habitats". Because TH-302 is active only in hypoxia, and hypoxia should be represented by a specific habitat, we specifically hypothesize that imaging of the hypoxic habitat can be used to predict and monitor responses to TH-302. The hypoxia habitat is classified as having low perfusion and high cell density. In contrast, the DOX-responsive habitat should be well perfused (yielding higher drug concentrations) and have high cell density (with more drug targets). This represents a conceptual advance as such habitats may provide a common predictive biomarker across the multiple histological sub-types of STS for patient stratification and therapeutic decision support. The approach will follow on preliminary work, wherein delineated habitats were quantitatively identified across multiple histological types and grades of\nSTS by combining T1, contrast- enhanced T1, and T2 STIR MR images. The current proposal is entirely pre-clinical, with the expectation that findings herein can be rapidly translated to clinial care. Preclinical work is justified in that there is greater flexibility to interrogate a wider porfolio of MRI pulse sequences and treatment strategies that can be related to underlying histology and molecular profiling. Aim 1 will quantitatively compare MR-visible habitats to histology and molecular profiles of xenotransplanted tumors. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that tumors with different habitat profiles will be differentially responsive to DOX and/or TH-302. In Aim 3, we wil investigate the effects of metabolic perturbations to affect the hypoxic habitat and thus improve response to TH-302. At the end of this study, we will have developed a new set of MR imaging biomarkers for predicting and monitoring response in this heterogeneous group of diseases, with the expectation that these finding will inform a follow-on study in the clinic.

While a great deal of effort has focused on new therapeutic approaches for EOC patients, EOC mortality rates have not markedly improved over the past decades. There is increasing interest in developing novel immunotherapeutic strategies, which require correlative studies to identify targets and patients who are most likely to benefit from these therapies. In the proposed study, we intend to study previously unexplored immune markers as predictors for outcomes among invasive serous EOC patients. Our preliminary results show that in patients with advanced EOC, mitochondrial products of cellular damage are released into the extracellular environment where they activate neutrophils. These stimulated neutrophils generate reactive oxidants and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a distinct mode of neutrophil death characterized by breakdown of membranes and extracellular release of stretches of DNA, histones, and proteases. While NETs function to defend against infection, in the tumor microenvironment, they are expected to facilitate invasion and metastasis. We will study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as a measure of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and their relationship to NETs in women with invasive serous EOC. We propose in Specific Aim 1 to evaluate the role of mtDNA levels in paired pre-treatment serum and ascites samples in predicting relapse within the first year, PFS and OS in patients with advanced serous EOC. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of neutrophils and NET markers in blood, ascites and tumors in invasive serous EOC outcomes. In Specific Aim 3, we intend to develop a new prognostic signature for patients with advanced serous EOC that incorporates the independent and combined effects of mtDNA, NET markers, and standard prognostic variables. To accomplish these Specific Aims, we will take advantage of, and expand on, an established collaborative infrastructure for sample collection and banking procedures to support evaluation of novel prognostic biomarkers for EOC. We will utilize a cohort of patients currently being recruited at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) to develop the prognostic signature, and similarly treated patients being enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) will be an independent validation cohort for findings in Specific Aim 3. Accomplishment of these aims will establish novel immune-based biomarkers for prognosis in EOC, and may create the foundation for new targets for immunotherapy.

We will utilize a cohort of patients currently being recruited at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) to develop the prognostic signature, and similarly treated patients being enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) will be an independent validation cohort for findings in Specific Aim 3. Accomplishment of these aims will establish novel immune-based biomarkers for prognosis in EOC, and may create the foundation for new targets for immunotherapy.

While a great deal of effort has focused on new therapeutic approaches for EOC patients, EOC mortality rates have not markedly improved over the past decades. There is increasing interest in developing novel immunotherapeutic strategies, which require correlative studies to identify targets and patients who are most likely to benefit from these therapies. In the proposed study, we intend to study previously unexplored immune markers as predictors for outcomes among invasive serous EOC patients. Our preliminary results show that in patients with advanced EOC, mitochondrial products of cellular damage are released into the extracellular environment where they activate neutrophils. These stimulated neutrophils generate reactive oxidants and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a distinct mode of neutrophil death characterized by breakdown of membranes and extracellular release of stretches of DNA, histones, and proteases. While NETs function to defend against infection, in the tumor microenvironment, they are expected to facilitate invasion and metastasis. We will study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as a measure of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and their relationship to NETs in women with invasive serous EOC. We propose in Specific Aim 1 to evaluate the role of mtDNA levels in paired pre-treatment serum and ascites samples in predicting relapse within the first year, PFS and OS in patients with advanced serous EOC. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of neutrophils and NET markers in blood, ascites and tumors in invasive serous EOC outcomes. In Specific Aim 3, we intend to develop a new prognostic signature for patients with advanced serous EOC that incorporates the independent and combined effects of mtDNA, NET markers, and standard prognostic variables. To accomplish these Specific Aims, we will take advantage of, and expand on, an established collaborative infrastructure for sample collection and banking procedures to support evaluation of novel prognostic biomarkers for EOC. We will utilize a cohort of patients currently being recruited at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) to develop the prognostic signature, and similarly treated patients being enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) will be an independent validation cohort for findings in Specific Aim 3.

The precursor lesion for TNBC is poorly characterized and the pathophysiology of TNBC is not well understood so therapies often fail to achieve complete pathological response and the disease is frequently non-curative. This proposal aims to clarify the molecular pathology of TNBC so that biomarkers for early diagnosis, prevention strategies and curative therapies can be developed. In our high-risk, multi-institutional cohort, with a high percent of AA women, we found that during\nbreast cancer initiation, pStat3 is high as is ECM stiffness and integrin/YAP mechanosignaling, and miRNAs implicated in tumor progression/aggression. TNBCs had the highest inflammation, pStat3 and miR-18a, the stiffest ECM and the lowest miR-203. Mouse studies indicated preventing inflammation decreases fibrosis and that reducing ECM stiffening lower pStat3 and inflammation and EMT and metastasis. Driving mammary mechanosignaling induced miR-18a and EMT and enhanced tumor aggression/metastasis. This suggests that an activated Stat3/tissue tension feedback loop, linked to tissue inflammation, promotes TNBC by engaging mechanosignaling pathways that alter miRs and induce an EMT and tumor aggression. While some breast cancers arise from focal lesions, TNBCs often appear to arise diffusely. We predict that in women at high-risk for TNBC (familial association, BRCA1 mutation) there is a dynamic and reciprocal relationship between the "at risk epithelium" and tissue tension that activates mechano-signaling pathways and induces Stat3/miRNA to 1) initiate TNBC, 3) induce an EMT and/or enhance tumor aggression, that 3) can be used to idenify precancerous lesions that have a high likelihood of progression to TNBC, and 4) could be used to monitor efficacy of prevention strategies and identify targets to improve TNBC treatment. We will use preclinical models to test: 1) if there is a reciprocal relationship between inflammation, pStat3 and tissue tension that\npromotes TNBC progression/aggression and 2) if this is mediated through miRs and EMT. We will examine a clinical cohort of high risk women who rapidly develop TNBCs to 3) test the prevalence of this signaling circuit in biopsies from women with TNBC and determine whether these biomarkers can identify precancerous lesions that have a high likelihood of progression to TNBC. Significance: Our studies could transform concepts of breast cancer by demonstrating that tissue tension could molecularly-prime tissue to malignancy. Markers that identify preneoplastic changes in TNBC, that could be used to monitor efficacy of risk reduction strategies, would have a transformative impact on TNBC mortality rates and particularly AA women.

In contrast to most other cancer treatments, immunotherapy can induce durable clinical response in metastatic disease. Antibodies targeting PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 have shown significant clinical activity in multiple diseases. Importantly, dramatic clinical responses have been seen in patients with the metastatic bladder, a disease in which no new drugs have been approved for over 20 years. The mechanism by which these immunotherapies work in cancer patients is unknown, nor are there robust biomarkers that predict of response to these treatments.  We will perform a clinical study administering anti-PD-L1 antibody in patients with localized bladder cancer prior to these patients undergoing planned surgery for their cancer. We propose to study the effects of anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment not just in the blood but within the actual tumor. We will determine whether this immunotherapy increases the number of T cells into the tumor by examining tissues from biopsies obtained before treatment and from the bladder tumor resected following treatment. We will use next generation sequencing to track individual T cell clones in the blood and tumors to also determine whether T cells present in the tumor are being recruited to the tumor site or were already at the tumor. We will study how this treatment activates a systemic immune response.  Understanding how these treatments work within patients, including at the level of the tumor tissue, will provide avenues t improve the efficacy of this approach and/or develop biomarkers to identify those patients that can benefit from treatment. Moreover, if significant tumor regression is seen, this treatment approach could transform our approach to localized bladder cancer.

project	5R01CA196658-02	R01CA196658	9314552	2017	A rapid spontaneous murine model of CN-AML	Grant	ABSTRACT\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is genetically complex, but patients can be divided into those with chromosomal\ntranslocations and those that are cytogenetically normal (CN-AML). CN-AML represents nearly 50% of human\nAML cases, and the overall 5-year survival for adults with CN-AML is approximately 30%. Mutations in the de\nnovo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and internal tandem duplications of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3\n(FLT3-ITD) and are two of the most frequent events in CN-AML. Moreover, recent whole-genome sequencing\nof CN-AML patient samples identified: 1) high-frequency co-occurrence of FLT3 and DNMT3A mutations, and\n2) corresponding changes to the risk classification for these CN-AML patients to a poorer prognosis.

project	5R01CA196658-03	R01CA196658	9538641	2018	A rapid spontaneous murine model of CN-AML	Grant	ABSTRACT\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is genetically complex, but patients can be divided into those with chromosomal\ntranslocations and those that are cytogenetically normal (CN-AML). CN-AML represents nearly 50% of human\nAML cases, and the overall 5-year survival for adults with CN-AML is approximately 30%. Mutations in the de\nnovo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and internal tandem duplications of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3\n(FLT3-ITD) and are two of the most frequent events in CN-AML. Moreover, recent whole-genome sequencing\nof CN-AML patient samples identified: 1) high-frequency co-occurrence of FLT3 and DNMT3A mutations, and\n2) corresponding changes to the risk classification for these CN-AML patients to a poorer prognosis. Because\nhuman epidemiologic studies cannot easily control for factors that confer disease risk, genetically engineered\nmouse (GEM) strains provide essential tractable platforms to mechanistically dissect disease pathobiology,\nheterogeneity and therapeutic response. Although neither Flt3-ITD nor inducible deletion of Dnmt3a induces\nspontaneous leukemia in mice, when we combined Flt3-ITD mutant alleles with inducible deletion of Dnmt3a\nwe find a spontaneous, rapidly lethal, completely-penetrant, and transplantable AML.

Much of the\nfocus has been place on T cells, in particular via checkpoint therapies such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1. Little is\ncurrently known of how individual populations of myeloid cells can be partners for T cells. We have recently\nisolated rare populations of myeloid cells that appear critical for robust responses but we don't yet fully\nunderstand how they work. We hypothesize that rare stimulatory dendritic cells traffic antigens and stimulate\nT cell according to specialized rules and that harnessing and modulation of this pathway is part of the reason\nthat checkpoint blockades may work. We further hypothesize that specific tissue-based cells are responsible\nfor upregulating the critical cytokine to make stimulatory dendritic cells but that tissue production is\ndysregulated in cancer and possibly improved with checkpoint therapies.\nIn this proposal we will be vastly extending an approach that my lab has been pursuing over the last few years.\nSpecifically we will be extending our cell-biology based studies of these critical cells (Aim1) to understand how\nthey play a fundamental role in antigen trafficking. Additionally, we will seek to understand how they hand off\nantigen to other antigen-presenting cells in the lymph node to engage T cells (Aim2) and how both of these\nprocesses are affected by checkpoint blockades.

The intimate\nrelationship between gammaherpesviruses and B cell differentiation is directly linked to the\nlymphomagenic capacity of these viruses. To ensure the establishment of long-term latency in\nmemory B cells, gammaherpesviruses drive a unique polyclonal germinal center reaction during\nearly infection. Germinal center reaction represents a stage of B cell differentiation that is\ncharacterized by rapid division of activated B cells along with genetic instability driven by\nenzymes that either induce DNA breaks or mutagenize DNA. It is not surprising that most\nEpstein-Barr virus-driven B cell lymphomas originate from germinal center or post germinal\ncenter B cells. This robust, gammaherpesvirus-stimulated germinal center reaction is transient\nand returns to near-baseline levels in long-term infected hosts. Importantly, it is not clear what\nattenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction.

Small animal, and in particular mouse, model systems are attractive to researchers\nfor numerous reasons, including their ease of use and well-described platforms. Immunotherapy has\nrevolutionized clinical oncology, but lacks pre-clinical models of the human immune system and human cancer\nto investigate new modalities and limitations/toxicities of treatment regimens. The ability to grow human tumors\nin immunodeficient mice (so-called patient-derived xenografts, or PDXs) allows researchers to work directly with\nhuman cancer tissue in a controlled setting. However, PDX models are limited by their lack of an intact immune\nsystem. The broad objective of this proposal is to validate an in vivo model to evaluate human tumors in\nthe context of a complete and intact human immune system in a completely personalized and autologous\nfashion. Herein, we propose to: (1) validate the ability to establish humanized mice from patients with\nmelanoma; (2) evaluate tumor growth and lymphocyte development in autologous human melanoma tumors\nestablished in humanized mice; and (3) validate the ability of this humanized system to serve as a model for\ncancer immunotherapy treatment response and toxicity. In each of these areas, we will leverage our multi-\ninstitutional team's individual expertise along with our institutional infrastructure to maximize the success of the\nexperimental aims. Furthermore, we will participate in the Oncology Models Forum and utilize the NCIP Hub\nresources to ensure that the methodology, data, and biologic model systems that result from this project are\nmade widely available to the general research community for future, hypothesis-driven research. Taken together,\nthe studies described in this research proposal will meet multiple goals and address several unmet needs\nidentified in this grant opportunity, thus significantly enhancing the applicability of a fully autologous and\nimmunocompetent precision model system for use in translational oncology research.

However,\ntargeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in\nglioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse\n(GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have\nprevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development.

The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and\nchemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft\n(PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor\nbeads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en\nmasse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this\nMulti-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models\nagainst human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from\ndistinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will\ndevelop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that\nwill be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM\nmodels against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and\ndrug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to\ndevelop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically-\ndefined tumor subtypes.

RAF inhibitors\nvemurafenib and dabrafenib improved survival of melanoma patients with BRAF(V600E) tumors. Unfortunate-\nly, responses are usually temporary, followed by development of resistance, most commonly due to ineffective\ninhibition of RAF and reactivation of ERK signaling in the presence of the drug. In addition, RAF inhibitors in-\nduce second site tumors, due to RAS-dependent paradoxical activation of RAF and downstream ERK signaling\nin normal cells. Outside of melanoma, RAF inhibitors showed limited efficacy in patients colorectal and thyroid\nBRAF(V600E) tumors, also due to ineffective inhibition of RAF/ERK signaling in these tumors. More recently,\ncombinations of RAF and MEK inhibitors showed improved efficacy compared to RAF inhibitor monotherapy,\nbut resistance eventually emerges as well. Resistance mechanisms identified to the RAF/MEK inhibitor combi-\nnation are similar to the ones identified for RAF inhibitor monotherapy, suggesting that ineffective inhibition of\nRAF is a critical limiting factor in both contexts. There is thus a pressing need for improved therapeutic strate-\ngies targeting oncogenic BRAF, such that durable responses and minimal side effects can be achieved. Our\nprevious work showed that regulation of BRAF kinase by dimerization determines both the development of re-\nsistance to currently used RAF inhibitors and inhibitor-induced RAF paradoxical activation, but the underlying\nmechanisms remain incompletely understood.

Resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and apoptosis is the dominant cause of treatment failure.\nThe molecular mechanisms responsible for chemotherapy resistance are poorly understood, hindering the\ndevelopment of therapeutic strategies to induce chemosensitivity. We have found that chemotherapy and\napoptosis resistance in high-risk AML requires aberrant phosphorylation of MEF2C, a key transcriptional\nregulator of leukemia cell growth and survival. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that defining the\napoptotic mechanisms dysregulated by aberrant MEF2C signaling will reveal effective therapeutic strategies to\novercome treatment resistance. The applicant, who is a New Investigator, will test this hypothesis by\ninvestigating the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis resistance in primary human and genetically-engineered\nmouse leukemias. Aim 1 will elucidate both transcriptional and cellular mechanisms of therapy resistance, with\nthe goal of identifying MEF2C targets that are necessary and sufficient for chemoresistance.

While Ewing sarcoma is relatively\nrare, the biology of this disease is also relevant to non-Ewing sarcomas, and to other cancer subtypes, due to\nthe presence of the EWS/FLI translocation, the driving event in this disease. Similar translocations involving\nETS transcription factors occur in other malignancies, including prostate cancer. Thus, understanding the\nbiology of Ewing sarcoma may provide insight into many cancer types. We will investigate the role of\nsecondary genetic events in the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma. These secondary events have been\nidentified through next-generation sequencing of primary tumors and cell lines. Specifically, we will evaluate\nthe role of STAG2 in mediating epigenetic and transcriptional changes induced by the driving oncogene in\nEwing sarcoma, EWS/FLI.\nIn Aim 1, we will use genomic approaches (RNAseq, ChIPseq, WGS, etc.) to assess the mechanistic role of\nSTAG2 in the regulation of chromatin architecture, transcription, and aneuploidy in Ewing cells. In Aim 2, we\nwill study the role of STAG2 in progression, maintenance and metastasis in Ewing sarcoma, using functional\nstudies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In Aim 3, we will determine whether there\nis a synthetic lethal dependency on STAG1 when STAG2 is absent in Ewing sarcoma cells. Our central\nhypothesis is that STAG2 loss plays a key role in the epigenetic reprogramming that drives the oncogenic\nfunction of EWS/FLI.

The rationale of this project is that there is a fundamental genetic\nbasis underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors that is poorly understood.

We will apply a conceptually\nand technically innovative, systematic, multidisciplinary, and highly collaborative approach to\nelucidate the neoantigen landscape underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our\ncontribution here is expected to provide unparalleled mechanistic detail on how immune checkpoint\ninhibitors function and to provide biomarkers to identify patients who will benefit from PD-1 blockade.\nFurthermore, building on data showing that resistance may be mediated by immune pressure and\nimmunoediting, we will shed light into how resistance to these drugs develop, providing definitive\nevidence for causal mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity.

Much of the cytotoxic response to therapy in cancer is governed by the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that heterogeneity in response at all three of these levels is governed by functional and molecular heterogeneity of mitochondria. BH3 profiling provides a functional measure of how close a cell is to the threshold of apoptosis by measuring mitochondrial sensitivity to BH3 peptides, a property we also refer to as apoptotic "priming". We have previously shown, in both hematologic and solid tumors, that pretreatment baseline priming of patient tumors predicts clinical response to conventional chemotherapy. Our approach to understanding response to targeted therapies is distinct. In contrast to the ubiquitous nature of the DNA and microtubules that are the targets of conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapies attack vulnerabilities that are selectively present in certain cancer cells. To identify where these vulnerabilities exist, we briefly (less than 24 hours) expose cancer cells to drugs and measure whether the drugs increase apoptotic priming. We have shown that this approach, which we call dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), can predict death of tumor cells from targeted agents in vitro and in vivo for both hematologic and solid tumors. There are two important advantages of DBP over conventional measures of cytotoxicity. First, DBP can be applied much more efficiently to primary patient samples. Experiments measuring cytotoxicity in cancer cells often require days of culture. Because the long-term culture of primary patient samples is so unreliable, cytotoxic measurements in primary tumors are unreliable. DBP requires no more than a day of ex vivo culture since we measure well before frank cell death occurs, and we have demonstrated its predictive power in primary liquid and solid tumors. Second, there are many useful anti-cancer agents that do not cause frank cell death, but which nonetheless provoke apoptotic signaling that facilitates killing in combination regimens. Classical cytotoxic measurements do not identify these, but DBP does. We propose to study intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity based on differential response to compounds that sensitize mitochondria for apoptosis. We will focus on colon cancer tumors, as we have access to primary and PDX specimens of these tumors. Our main goals are to develop a therapeutic toolbox of potentially useful drugs, determine how best to combine these in a personalized way, and also to understand the molecular basis of the heterogeneity of mitochondrial function that underlies differences in response to these drugs.

project	5R01CA208205-02	R01CA208205	9506703	2018	Reengineering obesity-induced abnormal microenvironment to improve PDAC treatment	Grant	ABSTRACT\nObesity is a worldwide public health problem, and its incidence is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity associates\nwith increased risk and worse prognosis of many malignancies including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\nHowever, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Obesity induces a pro-inflammatory state both locally\nin adipose tissue and systemically in visceral organs such as the pancreas. PDAC is a highly desmoplastic/fibrotic\ntumor in which angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) signaling activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), contributing to\nsolid stress (the mechanical force exerted by the solid components of the tumor). We have recently shown that obesity-\ninduced inflammation worsens the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME), and compromises perfusion,\noxygenation and chemotherapy in PDACs (Cancer Discovery 2016). Our preliminary data suggest that obesity increases\ntumor stiffness and solid stress, which compress blood vessels and hinder the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic\ntherapy. The desmoplastic reaction also promotes pro-survival signaling in cancer cells. We also found crosstalk\nbetween fibrotic (AT1) and inflammatory (interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) signaling pathways in PDACs in obese mice. These\nabnormalities also promote immunosuppression. Building on these exciting findings, we will further dissect molecular\nand mechanical mechanisms and develop novel strategies to overcome these obesity-induced biomechanical barriers\nto successful therapy in PDACs. We hypothesize that targeting AT1 and/or IL-1β will alleviate obesity-induced\ndesmoplasia and reprogram the immune TME. To this end, we will study spontaneous and orthotopic PDAC\nmice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) in both primary and liver metastasis settings. These PDAC models have\nsuccessfully recapitulated clinical disease. We will characterize mechanical properties of PDACs in DIO using a newly\ndeveloped approach together with the assessment of biochemical and cellular microenvironment. We will assess the\neffect of novel TME-activated AT1 blockers (TMA-ARBs), which allow delivery of high-dose ARBs to tumors while\navoiding systemic hypotension We will also study the FDA approved IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) on\nobesity-altered PDAC biomechanics, and on inflammatory cytokines and cells in obesity (Aim 1). We will evaluate if\nTMA-ARBs/ IL-1Ra can reprogram immune TME in PDACs with obesity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how\nelevated solid stress and stiffness alter tumor cells and host stromal cells using in vitro engineered microenvironments\nwith the results being tested in vivo (Aim 3). We anticipate that TMA-ARBs and/or IL-1Ra will alleviate desmoplasia\nand inflammation in PDACs in obese mice, reprogram ECM and immune TME and facilitate both conventional\nchemotherapy and immune checkpoint blocker immunotherapy.

Obesity associates\nwith increased risk and worse prognosis of many malignancies including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\nHowever, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Obesity induces a pro-inflammatory state both locally\nin adipose tissue and systemically in visceral organs such as the pancreas. PDAC is a highly desmoplastic/fibrotic\ntumor in which angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) signaling activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), contributing to\nsolid stress (the mechanical force exerted by the solid components of the tumor). We have recently shown that obesity-\ninduced inflammation worsens the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME), and compromises perfusion,\noxygenation and chemotherapy in PDACs (Cancer Discovery 2016). Our preliminary data suggest that obesity increases\ntumor stiffness and solid stress, which compress blood vessels and hinder the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic\ntherapy. The desmoplastic reaction also promotes pro-survival signaling in cancer cells. We also found crosstalk\nbetween fibrotic (AT1) and inflammatory (interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) signaling pathways in PDACs in obese mice. These\nabnormalities also promote immunosuppression. Building on these exciting findings, we will further dissect molecular\nand mechanical mechanisms and develop novel strategies to overcome these obesity-induced biomechanical barriers\nto successful therapy in PDACs. We hypothesize that targeting AT1 and/or IL-1β will alleviate obesity-induced\ndesmoplasia and reprogram the immune TME. To this end, we will study spontaneous and orthotopic PDAC\nmice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) in both primary and liver metastasis settings. These PDAC models have\nsuccessfully recapitulated clinical disease. We will characterize mechanical properties of PDACs in DIO using a newly\ndeveloped approach together with the assessment of biochemical and cellular microenvironment. We will assess the\neffect of novel TME-activated AT1 blockers (TMA-ARBs), which allow delivery of high-dose ARBs to tumors while\navoiding systemic hypotension We will also study the FDA approved IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) on\nobesity-altered PDAC biomechanics, and on inflammatory cytokines and cells in obesity (Aim 1). We will evaluate if\nTMA-ARBs/ IL-1Ra can reprogram immune TME in PDACs with obesity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how\nelevated solid stress and stiffness alter tumor cells and host stromal cells using in vitro engineered microenvironments\nwith the results being tested in vivo (Aim 3). We anticipate that TMA-ARBs and/or IL-1Ra will alleviate desmoplasia\nand inflammation in PDACs in obese mice, reprogram ECM and immune TME and facilitate both conventional\nchemotherapy and immune checkpoint blocker immunotherapy. If successful, these studies will lead to the\ndevelopment of novel treatment strategies for obese PDAC patients.

To achieve this goal, methods for scaling up evidence-based programs from research to wide-\nscale dissemination are needed to help balance effectiveness and cost. In many cases, there are pressures to\nreduce scale-up costs but at the expense of lower program implementation and effectiveness. A scale-up\nmethod that sacrifices effectiveness but reduces costs and reaches a larger number of employers may be\nacceptable. We will model the effectiveness and cost trade-off, along with the extent and representativeness of\nreach, when scaling up our evidence-based occupational sun protection intervention, Sun Safe Workplaces\n(SSW), for national distribution. The intervention, which relies on personal contact with managers and in-\nperson employee training (SSW-IP), created large improvements in comprehensive workplace sun safety (i.e.,\npolicy adoption and employee education) in a randomized controlled trial. We will compare the existing in-\nperson program delivery methods (SSW-IP) to a lower-cost dissemination method that utilizes Internet\ntechnology (SSW-T), i.e., virtual meetings, social networking, online training, and program materials. The aims\nof the research are to: 1) estimate the program reach (number and representativeness) and implementation\nrates (i.e., adoption of policies and delivery of education on occupational sun protection) achieved by the SSW-\nIP and SSW-T in a model of national distribution to public safety and public works industries; 2) estimate the\ncosts associated with the SSW-IP and SSW-T (i.e., intervention costs and induced employer costs) and compare\nthe estimated program benefits (i.e., policy and education) to cost; and 3) estimate the effect and cost-\neffectiveness of SSW-IP and SSW-T in secondary outcomes of a) changes in workplace environments and\nprocedures for sun safety and b) workers’ sun safety practices. In a 5-year project, SSW-T will be created by\nredesigning our very effective SSW-IP methods to use the latest web conferencing, social networking, and\nonline training technology for dissemination. The implementation rates (defined as policy adoption and\neducation delivery) and costs associated with SSW-IP (n=50 employers) and SSW-T (n=150 employers) will be\nmodeled in a randomized two-group pretest-posttest design, enrolling a national sample of 200 employers (i.e.,\nfirefighting departments and state departments of transportation). Unlike traditional randomized trials, the\nprimary analysis will be of cost effectiveness to test the hypothesis that SSW-T can be delivered cost-effectively\nto an expanded group of worksites producing a lower implementation rate than SSW-IP but at substantially\nlower cost. Secondary analyses will compare the two scale-up strategies on implementation rate, differences in\nrate by employer groups (e.g., size and region), changes to workplace environment/procedures, and employee\nsun safety practices.

Paradoxically, although estrogens stimulate breast cancers, risk rises markedly after menopause,\nwhen estrogens decrease. After menopause, estradiol falls and estrone is produced largely in fat by\naromatase. Obesity women have high estrone, and both obesity and high estrone, but not estradiol, increase\nER+ breast cancer risk after menopause. Low intra-tumor levels of enzymes converting estrone into estradiol,\nand elevation of enzymes that produce estrone both confer worse ER+ breast cancer outcome.\n Obesity mediates chronic inflammation through NF-κB driven cytokine expression. We showed contact\nbetween invading breast cancer cells and obese adipose tissue induces pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cell\ntypes that stimulate cancer stem cells (CSC) and drive metastasis. Our data suggest that cytokine induction\nafter breast fat:cancer cell contact is estrogen:ER dependent, since blocking estrogen synthesis with the\naromatase inhibitor, letrozole, reduced cytokine induction upon co-culture. While estradiol is known to oppose\nNF-κB mediated inflammation, the role of estrone in inflammation is not known and may differ from that of\nestradiol. We will study how estrone and estradiol, and changes in the ratios thereof before and after-\nmenopause, may influence NF-κB activity and the pro-inflammatory state in obese postmenopausal women.\n We hypothesize that increased estrone:estradiol ratio after menopause shifts ER from an NF-κB co-\nrepressor to a co-activator to up-regulate cytokines in obese adipocytes and cancer cells that drive CSC\nexpansion and metastasis. We also posit that enzymes that convert estradiol to estrone may contribute to the\npoor outcome of ER+ cancers in obesity. Aim 1 will test if estradiol:ER decreases, estrone:ER increases or\ndifferent estradiol:estrone ratios alter ER effects on NF-κB mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine\ngene drivers of CSCs in ER+ breast cancer cells. To test in Aim 2 if estrone cooperates with obesity to drive\nER+ breast cancer initiation and growth, we will co-culture human ER+ breast cancer cells with mammary\nadipocytes from women with different body mass index (BMI) +/- aromatase inhibition and test consequences\non cytokine levels and CSC. We will also implant syngeneic breast cancers into lean or obese wild-type or\naromatase knock-out mice to elucidate if host estrone mediates tumor promoting effects of obesity. Aim 3 will\ntest if overexpression of HSD17B14, that converts estradiol to estrone, increases ER+ breast cancer cytokine\nexpression and CSC in vitro, and increases tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo. We will also compare levels\nof estradiol/estrone interconversion enzymes in breast adipocytes and cancers from lean, overweight and\nobese women. A better understanding of the roles of estradiol and estrone may lead to new strategies for\nbreast cancer prevention and treatment, and to changes in hormone replacement therapies. Shifting toward a\nhigher estradiol: estrone ratio in serum or in breast cancer cells may prove to have therapeutic potential.

Although surgery is effective in early stage cancers, the median survival of women with advanced endometrial cancer is less than one year, and in the past 30 years there have been no major improvements in the treatment of advanced disease.  Neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy significantly increases long‐term survival, and there are no therapies (targeted or conventional) effective against metastatic disease.  Endometrial cancer research has lagged behind other cancers in grant allocation and progress relative to its clinical impact.  More recently, systematic genome‐wide sequencing efforts, such as the National Cancer Institute’s The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have brought the endometrial cancer genetic landscape into much clearer focus.  These studies have yielded many previously unsuspected endometrial cancer tumor suppressor genes (such as FBXW7) altered in a large percentage of cases, and thus of obvious clinical and research significance.  Cancers are complex amalgamations of various cell types that interact in myriad ways not only with one another, but also with the host organism.  Hence, many features of cancer cannot be modelled in vitro.  Consequently, in vivo genetic animal models are needed to further our understanding of these newly‐discovered genetic driver events in endometrial cancer.  Genetically‐engineered mouse models of endometrial cancer have lagged considerably relative to other types of cancer, and such models remain to be generated for most of the frequent endometrial cancer driver events.  One significant limitation has been the lack of fully optimized in vivo genetic models and the genetic tools to generate such models.  We propose to build upon prior efforts and employ a general, validated strategy to build a suite of genetic tools useful for the generation and characterization of diverse mouse models of invasive and lethal endometrial cancer.  The wide availability of this fully‐credentialed suite of genetic tools will bring new investigators into the field and greatly catalyze the development and use of clinically‐relevant mouse models of endometrial cancer.

People with\nLynch syndrome are also at increased risk for endometrial, ovarian, gastric, small bowel, and\nrenal cancers. Importantly, well-established clinical guidelines with strong evidence exist for\ncancer treatment, screening, and prevention in individuals with LS. Identification of individuals\nwith LS is accomplished through a variety of techniques, including family and medical history\nevaluation, computational models, or tumor testing. The systematic screening of all colorectal\ntumors for LS was first recommended by the Evaluation of Genetic Application in Practice and\nPrevention (EGAPP) working group in 2009 and has been designated high priority by the\nNational Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine working group and by the Blue\nRibbon Panel. The potential public health impact to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality of this\nintervention supports this priority, as effective implementation of LS screening will help meet the\ngoals of the Cancer Moonshot as well as demonstrate the promise of precision medicine.\nCurrently, implementation of LS screening in healthcare systems remains suboptimal for a\nvariety of reasons. LS screening involves the coordination of multiple departments and\nindividuals across an organization, which is often difficult in large, complex, healthcare systems.\nTherefore, the overarching goal of this project is to utilize tools from implementation science to\ndescribe, explain, and compare decision making and other variations in LS screening\nimplementation across multiple healthcare systems to create and evaluate in a real world setting\nan organizational toolkit to facilitate implementation of LS screening. Our specific aims are to (1)\nDescribe variation in LS screening implementation across multiple healthcare systems; then (2)\nExplain practice variation and determine factors associated with optimal implementation; and (3)\nDetermine the relative effectiveness, efficiency, and costs of different LS screening protocols by\nhealthcare system; and finally to (4) Develop and test in a natural environment an organizational\ntoolkit for LS screening. This toolkit will enable effective implementation of LS screening\nprograms; ultimately preventing needless suffering of patients and their family members from\npreventable cancers, decreasing waste in healthcare system costs, and informing strategies to\nfacilitate the promise of precision medicine.

Mice can also be\ngenetically engineered to study specific oncogenic pathways. Given the many positives associated with murine\nmodels, the vast majority of pre-clinical anti-cancer therapeutic studies are performed in a mouse.\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of oncology drugs (~94%) that are effective in murine tumor studies will\nultimately fail when tested in humans. These failures cost billions of dollars and waste physician and patient\nresources. Clearly, current preclinical mouse tumor models are not accurately predicting a patients’ response\nto therapy. Thus current mouse models need to be improved to more accurately reflect human disease. Each\nof the currently available mouse models of human cancer has distinct strengths, but also critical flaws. One\ncritical flaw in all available preclinical models is the lack of human tumor stroma. However, work from our\ngroup and others demonstrates that human tumor stroma is a critical component of the human tumor\nmicroenvironment which promotes human tumor growth, metastasis, suppresses anti-tumor immunity, and\ninduces therapeutic resistance.\nOur long term goal is to develop a human tumor model that will, by better representing human tumors, will\nbetter cancer therapeutic response seen in human clinical trials. We hypothesize that a human tumor model\nwith both human cancer cells and human tumor stroma will better represent primary human disease. As such,\nit will be a better/more stringent model for preclinical drug screening that could ultimately prevent a drug which\nis destined to fail from being used in clinical trials. We further hypothesize that human tumor stroma will better\nmaintain tumor cell heterogeneity over time to more accurately reflect the natural evolution of therapeutic\nresistance. Finally such a model will be ideal for evaluating the impact of human tumor stroma on novel\nimmune cell therapies. We propose to use a combination of human adult stem cells and cancer associated\nstem cells to create human tumor model with both human cancer cells and stromal cells.

Pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasias (PanINs)\nrepresent an early, localized developmental stage of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), when\ncurative surgical resection remains feasible.

We have created a\nnovel system for genetic modification and growth of primary human pancreatic cells to reconstitute the\ndevelopment of lesions with molecular and pathological features of human PanINs. Upon orthotopic\ntransplantation these immortalized clones produce stable human induced pancreatic intra-epithelial\nneoplasias (hiPanINs). Moreover, these PanIN lesions appear to be stable: after 6 months, they do not\ninvade locally or metastasize. Here we propose to validate and optimize this new system for generating\nstable human PanIN-like lesions to enhance its uses for addressing unmet translational needs. In Aim 1\nwe propose to generate new hiPanIN clones whose mutational spectrum matches that found in native\nPanIN and PDA development. We will also assess prioritized biomarkers identified in the hiPanIN system\nin native human PanIN and PDA specimens. In Aim 2 we propose collaborative studies to test whether\npancreatitis, further genetic modification, or extrinsic signals relevant to PDA can promote invasive or\nmetastatic PDA in the hiPanIN orthotopic transplantation model.

project	5R01CA213102-02	R01CA213102	9530602	2018	Development of an autologous humanized model of melanoma exploring human thymic education capacity	Grant	SUMMARY\nA constraint to studying human cancer is the limited availability of models with appropriate human stroma and\nimmunity. This caveat is particularly relevant for melanoma, given the pivotal role the immune system plays in\nits development. To address these limitations, we plan to study melanoma biology and therapy in a humanized\nmouse (HM) model. We initially developed a mis-matched HM (mHM; tumor and hematopoietic stem cells\n[HSCs] from different sources), and now have generated an autologous HM (aHM; tumor, HSCs and\nmesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] from the same patient). In HM bearing tumors the human immune and\nmesenchymal cells from the patient's bone marrow homed into the growing tumor, migrated into the pre-\nexisting mouse stroma, and interacted with the human cancer cells. Tumors grown in HM more closely\nresembled the originator tumor than those grown in non-HM mice, and the drift in gene expression caused by\nprior passaging was partially reversed. Signaling in key immune and stroma pathways was more prominent\nand closely resembled the originator patient in HM vs. non-HM models. The immune cells mounted effective\ntumor-specific immune responses, mediated by human immune cells including T cells. Significantly, immune\nresponses upon immune therapies in the HM melanoma models showed a correlation with the patient's\ntherapy results. Two salient and under-studied issues limit the wider application of HM: The relevance of the\ndegree of tumor and immune matching, which can affect the faithfulness of immune response, and that can\nonly be appreciated by comparing mHM and aHM. A second criticism to HM is xenogenic education of human T\ncells on mouse thymic cells, resulting from the lack of a functional human thymus in such models. In this\napplication we will further address the relevance of an autologous versus mis-matched HM to test which\napproach gives rise to a more representative model of melanoma; secondly, using the same precursor cells\nfrom the patient we will reconstitute a functional thymus. The overarching goal of this proposal is to conduct a\nco-clinical trial where we will accomplish the following: 1) prospectively generate and characterize aHM and\nmHM from 20 melanoma patients, 2) test which approach yields a more representative melanoma HM model,\n3) test in HM the immune drugs (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA4] and programmed cell\ndeath protein 1 [PD-1] inhibitors) that each patient received and correlate with the clinical data, 4) identify the\nmechanisms involved in resistance to CTLA4/PD-1 inhibitors; and finally as an exploratory Aim in selected\ncases, we will 5) generate thymic epithelium from the same patient's HSCs that will result in HM with a fully\nautologous melanoma, thymus and immune system, thus enabling immune cell education in a strictly human\ncontext. This project will advance our understanding of the tumor-host interaction in melanoma and human\ncancer, by better characterizing the interplay between melanoma cells and the immune and stroma systems,\nleading to the discovery of new approaches to improve personalization of therapy and improve outcomes.

In this\napplication we will further address the relevance of an autologous versus mis-matched HM to test which\napproach gives rise to a more representative model of melanoma; secondly, using the same precursor cells\nfrom the patient we will reconstitute a functional thymus. The overarching goal of this proposal is to conduct a\nco-clinical trial where we will accomplish the following: 1) prospectively generate and characterize aHM and\nmHM from 20 melanoma patients, 2) test which approach yields a more representative melanoma HM model,\n3) test in HM the immune drugs (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA4] and programmed cell\ndeath protein 1 [PD-1] inhibitors) that each patient received and correlate with the clinical data, 4) identify the\nmechanisms involved in resistance to CTLA4/PD-1 inhibitors; and finally as an exploratory Aim in selected\ncases, we will 5) generate thymic epithelium from the same patient's HSCs that will result in HM with a fully\nautologous melanoma, thymus and immune system, thus enabling immune cell education in a strictly human\ncontext. This project will advance our understanding of the tumor-host interaction in melanoma and human\ncancer, by better characterizing the interplay between melanoma cells and the immune and stroma systems,\nleading to the discovery of new approaches to improve personalization of therapy and improve outcomes.

State-\nlevel practitioners are in ideal positions to affect programs and policies related to cancer control. Mis-\nimplementation refers to ending effective programs and policies or continuing ineffective ones. Greater\nattention to mis-implementation should lead to use of effective interventions and more efficient expenditure of\nresources, which in the long term, will lead to positive cancer outcomes.\nGOAL: This proposal seeks to describe the extent of cancer control mis-implementation and to identify\nleverage points for addressing mis-implementation in the United States.\nAIMS AND METHODS: This is a three-phase study that takes a comprehensive approach, leading to the\nelucidation of tactics for addressing mis-implementation. Phase 1: The first aim seeks to assess the extent to\nwhich mis-implementation is occurring among state cancer control programs in public health. This initial phase\nwill involve a survey of 800 practitioners representing all states. The programs represented will span the full\ncontinuum of cancer control (from prevention to survivorship). Phase 2: Using data from Phase 1 to identify\norganizations in which mis-implementation is high or low, we will conduct eight comparative case studies to\nunderstand contextual differences. These case studies will highlight lessons learned about mis-implementation\nand identify hypothesized drivers. Phase 3: The 3rd aim seeks to build agent-based models to identify dynamic\ninteractions between individual, organizational, and contextual (external) factors driving mis-implementation.\nAgent-based modeling will be used to determine the most effective potential approaches for reducing mis-\nimplementation. We will translate and disseminate findings from Phases 1-3 to practitioners and practice-\nrelated stakeholders in order to support the reduction of mis-implementation. All study phases will rely on an\nAdvisory Group of public health practitioners and close collaboration with key practice partners.\nINNOVATIONS AND IMPACT: This study is innovative and impactful because it will: 1) be the first to refine\nand further develop reliable and valid measures of mis-implementation of public health programs; 2) bring\ntogether a strong, transdisciplinary team with significant expertise in practice-based research; 3) use agent-\nbased modeling to address cancer control implementation; and 4) use a participatory, evidence-based,\nstakeholder-driven approach that will identify key leverage points for addressing mis-implementation among\nstate public health programs. This research is expected to result in a replicable model that can significantly\nimpact mis-implementation in cancer control and can be applied to other health areas.

By enabling significant increases in the reconstructed\nimage signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), TOF-PET has demonstrated\nsubstantial clinical impact on the visualization and quantification of molecular signatures of cancer in\npatients. In particular it has been shown to improve image quality and accuracy in count starved and\ncontrast limited lesion detection scenarios. The effective photon sensitivity boost provided by TOF can\nalso be exploited to significantly reduce injected dose to the patient and/or study duration, factors that\nwould make PET more practical, cost-effective, and safe for a variety of clinical cancer imaging\napplications. Thus, studies that further advance the TOF-PET technique, and photon sensitivity in\ngeneral, are highly worthwhile. The key to better TOF-PET performance is to improve the annihilation\nphoton pair coincidence time resolution (CTR) measured between any two detection elements in the\nsystem, which has been a focus of research for the past two decades. Current commercially available\nPET systems achieve a CTR of roughly 350 to 800 ps full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). A goal of this\nproposal is to employ a novel scintillation detection configuration in order to achieve 100 ps FWHM CTR,\nwithout compromising other important performance parameters. This novel configuration also enables\nanother capability not possible with the conventional PET detector: The ability to measure the energy and\nthree-dimensional (3D) position of one or more annihilation photon interactions in the detector. Owing to\nthe fact that most incoming 511 keV photons undergo inter-crystal Compton scatter in the detectors, we\ncan exploit the kinematics of that process to estimate the photon angle-of-incidence. If successful, that\ncapability enables us to accurately position the first interaction of such multi-crystal events, but also offers\nthe potential to retain a high fraction of photon events that are normally rejected by a conventional PET\nsystem, such as single (unpaired) photons, random coincidences, tissue-scatter coincidences, and\nmultiple (>2) photon coincidences. Since these normally-discarded events are over 10-fold more\nprobable than true coincidence events in a standard PET study, this 3D position sensitive detector shows\npromise as another method to greatly boost photon sensitivity. If successful, this resulting substantial\nphoton sensitivity increase, along with the substantial image SNR enhancement possible with 100 ps\nCTR would enable PET to be more sensitive, accurate, and practical for cancer imaging. In this project\nwe will design and develop these next-generation detectors, integrate these modules into a prototype\npartial-ring PET system, and compare image quality and accuracy available with this partial-ring system\nto a state-of-the-art whole body TOF-PET system currently installed in our imaging clinic.

If successful, that\ncapability enables us to accurately position the first interaction of such multi-crystal events, but also offers\nthe potential to retain a high fraction of photon events that are normally rejected by a conventional PET\nsystem, such as single (unpaired) photons, random coincidences, tissue-scatter coincidences, and\nmultiple (>2) photon coincidences. Since these normally-discarded events are over 10-fold more\nprobable than true coincidence events in a standard PET study, this 3D position sensitive detector shows\npromise as another method to greatly boost photon sensitivity. If successful, this resulting substantial\nphoton sensitivity increase, along with the substantial image SNR enhancement possible with 100 ps\nCTR would enable PET to be more sensitive, accurate, and practical for cancer imaging. In this project\nwe will design and develop these next-generation detectors, integrate these modules into a prototype\npartial-ring PET system, and compare image quality and accuracy available with this partial-ring system\nto a state-of-the-art whole body TOF-PET system currently installed in our imaging clinic.	3-Dimensional;Clinic;Clinical;Collection;Communities;Compton radiation;Coupled;Crystallization;Data;Detection;Digital Signal Processing;Dimensions;Dose;Electronics;Elements;Event;Face;Future;Goals;Hot Spot;Image;Image Enhancement;Imaging Phantoms;Incidence;Lesion;Light;Location;Lutetium;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Noise;Optics;Output;Patients;Performance;Photons;Positioning Attribute;Positron-Emission Tomography;Process;Production;Radiation Dose Unit;Recovery;Research;Resolution;Scanning;Side;Signal Transduction;Silicon;System;Techniques;Technology;Time;Tissues;Tracer;Variant;Visualization;Width;absorption;analog;attenuation;base;cancer imaging;cost effective;data acquisition;design;detector;experimental study;image reconstruction;imaging study;improved;innovation;kinematics;next generation;novel;photomultiplier;photon-counting detector;preservation;prototype;response;scale up;statistics;tomography;tumor molecular fingerprint;uptake	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	STANFORD	CA	UNITED STATES	CRAIG S LEVIN	DCTD	BOKLYE  Kim	516315	$500k to $749k	516315	1-Jun-2021	1-Jun-2017	31-May-2023	PA-16-160	Moonshot

Since CRC develops over a number of\nyears from precursor lesions called polyps, it is largely detectable and preventable in early stages. As these\npolyps become larger, they, like most CRCs, tend to bleed, which is the rationale for the use of fecal occult\nblood tests (FOBTs) to detect both polyps and cancers early, while they are curable. However, early\nscreening and detection is much less common than it could be, with about 43% of eligible individuals\nunscreened. Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) are a type of FOBT that can be a sensitive, specific, and low-\ncost alternative to colonoscopy for CRC screening. Modeling studies have shown that for population screening,\na strategy of annual FIT testing from age of 50 to 75 years results in an equal number of life-years gained as\ncompared with colonoscopy every 10 years. However, about 90% of screening in the U.S. is done with\ncolonoscopy, the most expensive and invasive screening test. FITs are far less costly and largely replacing the\nguaiac test in CRC screening programs internationally, where only individuals with positive results are referred\nfor a colonoscopy. Studies done on FITs in other countries often used FITs not available in the U.S. or studied\nhigh-risk populations; thus, results are not applicable in the U.S. It is critical to determine the FIT(s) with the\nbest test characteristics in order to implement successful FIT-based screening programs in this country.\nIt is estimated that 24 million more individuals will need to be screened by 2018 to reach the “80% by\n2018” goal set by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. To address this knowledge gap, we propose\nto compare the test characteristics of three CLIA-waived FITs and two automated FITs, using colonoscopy\nas the gold standard. The rationale for this proposed study is that, for almost all of the FITs currently marketed\nin the U.S., there is no evidence of the accuracy claimed. Our aims are:\n Aim 1: To assess the diagnostic accuracy for advanced colorectal neoplasms of three of the most\n commonly used CLIA-waived FITs and two automated FITs, using colonoscopy as the gold standard.\n Aim 2: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two quantitative FITs using receiver operating characteristic\n (ROC) analysis.\n Aim 3: To assess factors associated with false positive and false negative FIT results for each device.\nThese findings will provide essential information about FITs with the best test characteristics for future\nexpanded use of FIT, critically important to achieving our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality\nfrom CRC. FITs are more acceptable to patients, will allow higher screening rates, and will reduce costs as\ncompared with a screening strategy based on colonoscopy as the primary initial screening method.

Furthermore,\nlower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality\noutcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more\neffective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and\nmortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have\ntargeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a\nstatistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web-\nenabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms\nwill be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider\ncommunication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits.

The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding\nthe intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to\ndevelop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term\neffects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample\npowered to test multiple levels of the intervention.

Although we have driven down\npopulation smoking rates, and with them, cancer rates, roughly 28% of the socioeconomically disadvantaged\nstill smoke regularly. Low-income (L-I) smokers also develop cancer at higher rates and struggle more to quit\nthan do higher-income smokers. These disparities in tobacco use and its burdens must be addressed. Highly\neffective cessation treatment services that can be delivered remotely, flexibly, and conveniently with few cost\nor logistical barriers have the potential to achieve this aim. Tobacco quitline and SmokefreeTXT services are\nsuch treatment resources with demonstrated attractiveness and reach among L-I smokers. The current\nproposal will use an efficient factorial design to evaluate 4 smoking cessation interventions with vast reach and\ndissemination potential. The target population will be N=1,408 Medicaid-eligible or uninsured smokers who\nhave recently enrolled in the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL), but who report continued smoking 4-\nmonths following engagement in standard WTQL services. These treatment non-responders will be invited to\nparticipate in an experiment that will randomize them to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following 4 factors in a\n2X2X2X2 design: WTQL counseling intensity (1 session vs. 4 sessions), medication intensity (2-week nicotine\npatch monotherapy vs. 4-week nicotine patch and lozenge combination therapy), a supportive text messaging\nprogram (SmokefreeTXT vs. none), and financial incentives (rewards of up to $150 for treatment engagement\nvs. no treatment incentives). The primary outcome will be 26-week biochemically confirmed point-prevalence\nabstinence. Analyses will examine the main and interactive effects of these 4 treatment components on 26-\nweek and secondary abstinence outcomes to identify the components and combinations of components that\nsignificantly enhance success in quitting in this high-risk population. This experiment will identify especially\neffective combinations of highly scalable interventions of modest cost and few barriers that could be\ndisseminated nationally to reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking cessation among those seeking to\nquit. Additional analyses will: compare intervention components and promising component combinations in\nterms of cost-effectiveness, examine whether or not treatment engagement differs across component\ncombinations, examine baseline variables that may moderate treatment response, and identify mediators of\ntreatment effects on abstinence outcomes. Because delivery of the study interventions can be centralized\nthrough established and efficient services (WTQL and SmokefreeTXT), the potential for both scalable\ndissemination and cost-effectiveness of the interventions tested is great. The proposed research will help\nidentify ways to reduce tobacco cessation disparities in L-I smokers who have tried to quit smoking but\nrelapsed and may benefit from improved assistance.

Project summary/abstract\nPROJECT: Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of\nHPV+ women who have performed self-collection\nCervical cancer is a serious public health problem reflecting social and gender inequalities in health. It is the\nthird cause of cancer death among women in the world, with more than 85% of cases occurring in developing\ncountries. Currently, the development of new technologies based on HPV DNA detection allows HPV self-\ncollection, increasing screening coverage. In a self-collection based strategy, triage becomes a key step in the\nprevention process, as it is the first method to identify HPV+ women who will need diagnostic and treatment\nprocedures. However, high adherence to triage is difficult to obtain, which is not surprising given that\nadherence to follow-up and treatment is a generalized problem in cervical cancer programs.\nSpecific aims of the study are: 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative multi-component mHealth\nintervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests compared to usual\ncare. 2. To evaluate the implementation strategy and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the\nmulti-component mHealth intervention.\nThe research study design will follow the structure of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial, and\nwill use mix-method approach. A cluster randomized trial including 200 CHWs (clusters) and 4000 women will\nbe used to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to\ncytology triage at 120 days after positive HPV testing. The mHealth intervention will include SMS messages\nsent to HPV+ women to inform them when results are available, and subsequent SMS messages as\nreminders. In addition, for those HPV+ women who did not had a triage cytology result within 60 days of the\nHPV test result, CHWs will receive an e-mail and SMS message so they can contact these women during\nhome visits for specific counseling and support. For the implementation evaluation, the Consolidated\nFramework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to guide qualitative data collection and analysis\nof factors that influence implementation. RE-AIM will be used to assess the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,\nImplementation and Maintenance of the Intervention.\nResults of this project will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention\nto increase triage of HPV+ women, but it could be adapted to increase compliance of diagnoses/ treatment of\ncervical cancer and other health problems. Findings from the implementation evaluation will be highly\napplicable to programs that use or are planning to incorporate HPV self-collection in different settings and\ncountries.

project	5R01CA221290-02	R01CA221290	9527109	2018	Metabolic reprogramming of Tregs in tumor immunity	Grant	Program Description/Abstract\nMetabolic reprogramming is a fundamental process underlying the growth of cancer cells and activated\nlymphocytes. These rapidly dividing cells markedly upregulate aerobic glycolysis (Warburg metabolism) and\nalso reprogram mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to support the energy and growth\ndemands. Moreover, mTOR signaling is a central regulator of anabolic metabolism in cancer cells and\nlymphocytes. While Warburg and mitochondrial metabolism and mTOR signaling are being actively studied, we\nare just beginning to appreciate the involvement of other biosynthetic programs such as de novo lipid synthesis\n(lipogenesis). Emerging evidence highlights that cancer immunotherapy is a powerful tool to combat cancers,\nbut immune tolerance mediated by immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) represents a major obstacle\nfor effective anti-tumor immunity. Although mTOR was generally considered a crucial negative regulator of\nTregs, our genetic studies have revealed that mTORC1 is a pivotal positive determinant of Treg function by\nlinking immune signals to the lipogenic program. In our preliminary studies, disruption of the lipogenic program\nin Tregs rendered the mice to reject tumor cells but did not cause obvious autoimmune disorders under steady\nstate. We hypothesize that lipogenic program contributes to Treg suppressive activity in the tumor\nmicroenvironment, which could represent a novel target for cancer immunotherapy. We will test this hypothesis\nby establishing the roles of Treg lipogenic programs in tumor immunity, and determining the metabolic and\nsignaling basis whereby lipogenesis programs Treg functions. We predict these studies will establish a new\nparadigm on our understanding of lipogenic program in Tregs and how this impinges upon tumor immunity.\nInsights gained from this project will likely lead to innovative strategies on cancer immunotherapy by\ncapitalizing on metabolic reprogramming of Tregs.

project	5R01CA221290-03	R01CA221290	9742441	2019	Metabolic reprogramming of Tregs in tumor immunity	Grant	Program Description/Abstract\nMetabolic reprogramming is a fundamental process underlying the growth of cancer cells and activated\nlymphocytes. These rapidly dividing cells markedly upregulate aerobic glycolysis (Warburg metabolism) and\nalso reprogram mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to support the energy and growth\ndemands. Moreover, mTOR signaling is a central regulator of anabolic metabolism in cancer cells and\nlymphocytes. While Warburg and mitochondrial metabolism and mTOR signaling are being actively studied, we\nare just beginning to appreciate the involvement of other biosynthetic programs such as de novo lipid synthesis\n(lipogenesis). Emerging evidence highlights that cancer immunotherapy is a powerful tool to combat cancers,\nbut immune tolerance mediated by immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) represents a major obstacle\nfor effective anti-tumor immunity. Although mTOR was generally considered a crucial negative regulator of\nTregs, our genetic studies have revealed that mTORC1 is a pivotal positive determinant of Treg function by\nlinking immune signals to the lipogenic program. In our preliminary studies, disruption of the lipogenic program\nin Tregs rendered the mice to reject tumor cells but did not cause obvious autoimmune disorders under steady\nstate. We hypothesize that lipogenic program contributes to Treg suppressive activity in the tumor\nmicroenvironment, which could represent a novel target for cancer immunotherapy. We will test this hypothesis\nby establishing the roles of Treg lipogenic programs in tumor immunity, and determining the metabolic and\nsignaling basis whereby lipogenesis programs Treg functions. We predict these studies will establish a new\nparadigm on our understanding of lipogenic program in Tregs and how this impinges upon tumor immunity.\nInsights gained from this project will likely lead to innovative strategies on cancer immunotherapy by\ncapitalizing on metabolic reprogramming of Tregs.

Our proposal addresses the problem of advanced, PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. We propose a\nrole for PI3K-inhibitors in this disease at a stage when the disease no longer responds to endocrine\nmanipulation, cdk4/6- or mTOR-inhibition and when patients typically receive palliative chemotherapy. These\npre-treated tumors frequently display increased glucose avidity as evidenced by high SUVmax values in 18FDG-\nPET-scans and highly active glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect. 30 - 40% of breast tumors have\nactivating PIK3CA mutations, and these co-occur with expression of estrogen receptor (ER). There are current\nclinical trial efforts aimed using modern PI3K-inhibitors (PI3Ki) GDC0032, Copanlisib or Gedatolisib to restore\nresponsiveness to ER blockade, but studies to integrate these drugs at a later stage of PIK3CA-mutant BC are\nlacking. Here we propose a role for these more modern PI3K-inhibitors at later stages of the disease,\nwhen PIK3CA-mutant tumors have developed endocrine, cdk4/6i and mTORi resistance. We have\nrecently discovered that PI3Ki work by disrupting an AKT-independent pathway that regulates glycolysis\nand sustains the Warburg effect, in addition to the disruption of canonical signaling pathways via AKT. In this\npathway PI3K triggers the mobilization and release of aldolase from the cytoskeleton, and this in turn\npotentiates aldolase activity and the Warburg effect. This basic mechanism links PI3K signaling with\ncytoskeletal dynamics and enhanced glycolytic flux. To what extent PI3Ki efficacy is determined by the\nability to inhibit aldolase and to suppress the Warburg effect in advanced cancer, is still unknown and will be\nexamined here. We propose that the activating PIK3CA mutation fuels the carbohydrate metabolism of\nPIK3CA-mutant BC, even at the stage of endocrine resistance, hat the anti-metabolic activity of PI3K-inhibitors\ncan be visualized using in vivo NMR and exploited to improve treatment outcomes in combination with anti-\nneoplastic agents. In the first aim we will introduce a mutant form of aldolase to determine the contribution of\nthe PI3K-aldolase axis to PI3Ki-efficacy in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. In the second aim we will determine\nin vivo if the metabolic changes induced by PI3K-inhibition are predictive of cancer treatment responses. We\nwill visualize lower glycolysis directly in tumors in vivo using NMR detection of 13C[1]-pyruvate\nmetabolism and compare the predictive value of NMR with that of 18FDG-PET CT. Simultaneous studies of the\nflux of 13C-glucose and 13C[1]-pyruvate will be used to pinpoint mechanisms of resistance. In a third aim, we\nwill develop treatment combinations that may improve the outcomes for women with metastatic BC. Given the\nvulnerability of BC cells in the early post-mitotic phase, we propose to explore PI3K-inhibition following\ninfusion of taxanes or vinca alkaloids in mouse models of PIK3CA-mutant endocrine-resistant BC.

project	5R01CA229164-02	R01CA229164	9857574	2020	Novel Degraders of the Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR Splice Variants (AR-SVs)	Grant	Approximately 160,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) and around 30,000 died of PCa in 2017.\nOver 3.3 million men are surviving with PCa in the United States and this number is expected to increase to 4.5\nmillion by 2026. Current therapeutic strategies for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) include\nandrogen receptor (AR) antagonists and a CYP17A1 inhibitor that prevents synthesis of androgens. Although\nthese drugs extend the progression-free survival, approximately 30% of the tumors do not respond to these\ntherapies and the remaining develops resistance shortly after treatment initiation. One of the primary reasons for\nCRPC relapse, despite these treatments, is expression of constitutively-active AR splice variants (AR-SV) that\nlack the ligand binding domain (LBD). To overcome this critical barrier, we discovered novel AR antagonists\n(Selective Androgen Receptor Degraders (SARDs)) that bind to the AR-activation function-1 domain (AF-1) in\nthe N terminal domain (NTD) and/or LBD and antagonize and degrade AR and AR-SVs. The SARDs have unique\npharmacologic properties that strongly and selectively antagonize the AR and degrade full length and splice\nvariant AR (independent of LBD) in multiple models. These SARDs inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells and\ntumors that are dependent on AR full length and splice variants for growth.\nThe SARDs we have tested thus far have poor bioavailability and drug-like properties. In order to overcome the\npoor bioavailability and to understand the mechanisms of action, we propose a) to develop novel SARDs that\nwill inhibit and degrade full length and splice variants of the AR and will be orally bioavailable and b) to identify\nmechanisms by which the AR and its splice variants are degraded, resulting in drugs with better efficacy. Under\naim-1 we will synthesize AR antagonists belonging to new generation of SARDs that will degrade the AR, inhibit\nprostate cancer growth, and will be orally bioavailable. We will synthesize and identify orally bioavailable SARDs\nand evaluate those using in vitro and in vivo PCa and CRPC models.

Current therapeutic strategies for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) include\nandrogen receptor (AR) antagonists and a CYP17A1 inhibitor that prevents synthesis of androgens. Although\nthese drugs extend the progression-free survival, approximately 30% of the tumors do not respond to these\ntherapies and the remaining develops resistance shortly after treatment initiation. One of the primary reasons for\nCRPC relapse, despite these treatments, is expression of constitutively-active AR splice variants (AR-SV) that\nlack the ligand binding domain (LBD). To overcome this critical barrier, we discovered novel AR antagonists\n(Selective Androgen Receptor Degraders (SARDs)) that bind to the AR-activation function-1 domain (AF-1) in\nthe N terminal domain (NTD) and/or LBD and antagonize and degrade AR and AR-SVs. The SARDs have unique\npharmacologic properties that strongly and selectively antagonize the AR and degrade full length and splice\nvariant AR (independent of LBD) in multiple models. These SARDs inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells and\ntumors that are dependent on AR full length and splice variants for growth.\nThe SARDs we have tested thus far have poor bioavailability and drug-like properties. In order to overcome the\npoor bioavailability and to understand the mechanisms of action, we propose a) to develop novel SARDs that\nwill inhibit and degrade full length and splice variants of the AR and will be orally bioavailable and b) to identify\nmechanisms by which the AR and its splice variants are degraded, resulting in drugs with better efficacy. Under\naim-1 we will synthesize AR antagonists belonging to new generation of SARDs that will degrade the AR, inhibit\nprostate cancer growth, and will be orally bioavailable.

Thus, there is an urgent need for new, improved treatments to eliminate AML cells rapidly\nand completely. Since AML is a highly heterogeneous disease caused by multiple mutations, we propose that\na common, targetable feature among AML cases is that they are directly and indirectly influenced by cytokines\nsecreted in the bone marrow microenvironment. Our long-term goal is to identify novel drug targets to\nselectively eradicate malignant clones that may impact the response to AML therapies. Our immediate goals\nare to comprehensively determine the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory pathways promote clonal\nevolution in AML. We found that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is elevated in a diverse\nset of AML patients, both encourages AML cells to multiply and simultaneously impedes normal cell growth.\nBlocking communication between AML cells and IL-1 inhibits these effects and reduces survival of AML cells\nwhile sparing healthy progenitors. Because cells from a majority of AML patients with different genetic\nsubtypes are dependent on IL-1 signaling for their survival, we predict that a large percentage of AML patients\nmight benefit from drugs targeting this pathway. However, direct targeting of IL-1 signaling may impact cellular\nfunctions in healthy cells. We therefore focused our study on defining the IL-1-mediated molecular differences\nbetween AML and healthy progenitors. Gene expression analysis identified that IL-1 upregulates ASF1B and\nMARCKS in AML compared to healthy progenitors. ASF1B and MARCKS regulate cell proliferation, DNA\ndamage response, and inflammation in AML. Our data shows that genetic and pharmacological targeting of\nASF1B and MARCKS pathways suppresses AML growth. These findings suggest a number of important new\nresearch directions. In the proposed project, we will test the hypothesis that differential activation of ASF1B\nand MARCKS by IL-1β in AML versus healthy progenitors provides a competitive advantage to leukemic cells,\nwhich ultimately leads to AML progression. Specifically, we will determine: (1) the in vitro mechanisms by\nwhich IL-1 activation of ASF1B and MARCKS promotes the growth of AML cells; (2) the roles of ASF1B and\nMARCKS in conferring IL-1-mediated growth advantage and driving AML progression in vivo; and (3) the\nvalidity of ASF1B and MARCKS as therapeutic targets in AML using available small-molecule inhibitors. To\nachieve our goals we established a variety of tools including 4 new transgenic mouse models and access to\nTLK and MARCKS inhibitor through collaborations with world-renowned leaders. Determining the underlying\nmolecular mechanisms by which IL-1 supports AML development will pave the way to designing new treatment\nstrategies.

The proposed study will\ngenetically exploit lncRNA-regulated cellular networks in TNBC to identify an improved therapeutic strategy. Our\nresearch has illuminated lncRNA involvement in TNBC metastasis and metabolic reprogramming. One\nlncRNA, LINK-A, is upregulated in TNBC and is negatively correlated with breast cancer patient outcomes.\nTissue-specific expression of LINK-A in mouse mammary glands drives tumor development and lung metastasis,\nwhich shares morphological and transcriptional similarity to human TNBC. Furthermore, the expression of LINK-\nA facilities an immunosuppressive environment and profoundly impacts CD9+ T-cell infiltration via lncRNA-\nmediated antigenicity loss. Mechanistically, LINK-A concurrently activates multiple oncogenic signaling\npathways and promotes TRIM71-dependent degradation of the peptide-loading complex, leading to impaired\nantigen presentation. Therefore, LINK-A transgenic mice should serve as a powerful tool for dissecting the\nmolecular complexity of TNBC and assessing precise therapeutic formulations against TNBC. Since most\npathway inhibitors in TNBC clinical trials have been unsuccessful, a lncRNA-directed therapeutic approach, with\nthe appropriate combination of immunotherapy, may optimize the efficacy of therapies for TNBC.\nThe long-term goal of the proposal is to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated antigenicity\nloss and immunosuppression so that improved strategies can be developed to reduce TNBC morbidity and\nmortality. Our central hypothesis is that LINK-A promotes the initiation and immunoresistance of breast cancer,\nwhich can be attenuated in vivo by a combinatorial treatment approach. We will address our hypothesis from\nfollowing aspects: we will first define the underlying molecular mechanism of lncRNA-dependent antigenicity\nloss. We will then restore antigenicity by targeting lncRNA and lncRNA-related signaling events. Finally, we will\nascertain the functional importance of lncRNAs in breast cancer tumorigenesis.\nEmerging evidence of the oncogenic involvement of lncRNAs, as well as their implicated roles in mediating\nimmunosurveillance and immunosuppression, warrants further characterization of TNBC-specific lncRNAs and\nfuture applications that hinge on their activity. Our goal is to demonstrate that LINK-A, as a hallmark of TNBC,\nmay serve as a diagnostic marker that predicts a cancer’s sensitivity to immunotherapy. Thus, a strategy that\ncombines immune checkpoint blockers and lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies has the potential to significantly\nadvance TNBC treatment. In the long run, these research findings will benefit the cancer community by\nintroducing the robust clinical effects of targeting lncRNAs and a well-defined means of stratifying patients based\non these oncogenic lncRNAs.

project	5R01CA241148-02	R01CA241148	10145618	2021	Targeting Aldehyde Dehydrogenase for Cancer Prevention	Grant	ABSTRACT:\nIn cancer, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme activity is high in dendritic cells and regulatory T-cells,\nhypothesized to modulate the immune response and also in cancer stem cells (CSCs) to aid the development of\nrecurrent resistant disease. It is therefore surprising that drugs targeting ALDH have not been developed to\nmodulate these processes in cancer. To investigate this issue, we tested the efficacy of existing isoform-specific\nand broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitors on cultured cells and found that none were very effective at modulating cell\nsurvival. Furthermore, we predicted that a broad-spectrum inhibitor would be needed due to the overlapping\nfunctions of the ALDH family members. These observations provided the rationale to develop a non-toxic broad-\nspectrum ALDH inhibitor, which would kill ALDH+ CSCs to prevent recurrent resistant disease, and improve\nimmunotherapy of melanoma. Thus, the central hypothesis is that a non-toxic ALDH inhibitor can be developed\nto reduce recurrent resistant disease development mediated by ALDH+ CSCs and improve the efficacy of\nexisting immunotherapies by reducing immune suppression. Preliminary data show development of a potent\nnon-toxic ALDH inhibitor built on the backbone of the Isatin natural product. This agent eliminates CSCs with\nhigh ALDH activity, preventing increases in ALDH+ cells typically seen with traditional drug treatments. Finally,\nthe inhibitor improves the preclinical efficacy of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model\nwhere this approach alone is not effective. Based on these hypothesis-supporting preliminary data, the following\nSpecific Aims are proposed. First, determine how effectively a non-toxic broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitor\neliminates the melanoma ALDH+ CSC population that expands when treating with traditional chemotherapy.\nFurthermore, determine its potency when combined with traditional chemotherapy to prevent recurrent resistant\ndisease development. This will be achieved by isolating ALDH+ and ALDH- cell populations from cell lines and\npatient derived (PDX) tumors and determining inhibitor efficacy for preventing recurrent resistant disease\ndevelopment when provided in combination with current clinically relevant chemotherapy. Finally, the\nmechanistic basis for inhibition of resistance by the agent combination will be identified. Second, determine the\nefficacy of a non-toxic broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitor on immune regulatory and effector cells in the tumor\nmicroenvironment, alone and when combined with anti-PD1 antibody immunotherapy. Specific targeting of\nALDH in melanoma tumor cells and in host cells on therapeutic efficacy will be tested. Mechanisms leading to\nenhanced immune response will be identified by defining the impact of the inhibitor and antibody combinations\non immune cell composition and function within the tumors, assessing the relative ALDH levels in the immune\ncell populations, and using transient and genetic approaches to target the modulating immune cells. These\nsignificant discoveries would demonstrate the efficacy of targeting ALDH enzymes in cancer for modulating\nresistance and immune cell function, providing needed preclinical validation necessary for clinical translation.

While\nEGFR tyrosine kinase activity inhibitors (TKI) have shown effectiveness, within 9-13 months all patients\ndevelop resistance including to 3rd generation TKI - Osimertinib. These patients do not have any approved\ntherapy options, therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a novel agent that functions independently of\nkinase function. DGD1202, a first-in-class, novel, orally bioavailable, small molecule that inhibits EGFR\ndimerization, induces degradation of EGFR and selectively kills TKI resistant NSCLC tumors.\nObjective: We and others have shown that the degradation of mutant EGFR protein has a profound effect on\ncancer cell survival. Thus, we hypothesized that a drug which induces degradation of mtEGFR independent of\nthe ATP binding domain will result in selective activity. Our objective is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of\nDGD1202 in a panel of lung cancer cells lines, xenografts, and PDXs derived from lung cancer patients\ncontaining mtEGFR who have undergone treatment with a TKI.\nSpecific Aims: We propose to evaluate the specificity and potency of DGD1202 against TKI-resistant lung\ncancer cells and xenografts. Aim 1 is to determine the in vitro efficacy of DGD1202 against a panel of EGFR\ndriven, including osimertinib-resistant, cancer cell lines relative to normal cells. Aim 2 is to conduct in vivo\npharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses to assess drug exposure and determine the effect\non the target. Aim 3 is to determine the overall therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety of DGD1202 in vivo.\nWe hypothesize that treatment with DGD1202 will induce EGFR degradation preferentially in tumor cells driven\nby mtEGFR and that EGFR degradation will correlate with the overall response.\nStudy Design: We will screen DGD1202 alongside osimertinib in a series of lung cancer lines. The resulting\nresponse will be then correlated with effect on EGFR degradation. We also propose to determine in vivo PK\nand PD studies both with a single and with fractionated dosing to determine the optimum bioavailability. Using\nthe optimized dose and schedule, we will assess effects on EGFR protein against a panel mtEGFR-driven and\nosimertinib resistant lung cancer xenograft and PDX models. The long-term safety will be assessed in immune\ncompetent mice. Standard statistical models will be used to compare the response to treatment and how it\ncorrelates with effects on EGFR.\nImpact: We anticipate that our approach will open a new way to target EGFR and, more broadly, to develop\ntherapeutics to selectively target mutated proteins to degradation. The knowledge gained from in vivo tumor\nmodels will provide a rationale for the use of this class of molecules in future clinical studies.

The majority of these patients will enter into a prolonged post-treatment survivorship\nphase of care. However, we are currently facing unprecedented challenges in survivorship care delivery.\nSerious gaps in the care of survivors have been identified, including underuse of guideline-recommended\ncancer surveillance services, such as annual mammography for breast cancer survivors and colonoscopy for\ncolorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, and underuse of recommended preventive care services such as\nvaccinations, lipid testing and cardiovascular risk management, and disease screenings. Compounding these\nissues, our current oncology workforce is insufficient to care for the rapidly growing population of survivors.\nPrimary care provider (PCP)-led survivorship care is a feasible model of survivorship care. In observational\nstudies, survivors who receive care that involves PCPs received higher quality of care; international\nrandomized trials comparing PCP-led to oncology-led survivorship care have shown no significant differences\nin time to detection of cancer recurrence or quality of life for early-stage survivors. However, there is a paucity\nof high-quality research on models of survivorship care in the U.S, particularly in community-based settings,\nseriously limiting our ability to provide high-quality cancer survivorship care. To address these issues, we will\nconduct a prospective cluster randomized trial of two models of cancer survivorship care in early-stage, low-\nrisk breast cancer and CRC survivors cared for in a community-based, integrated health care setting. Building\non our pilot work and drawing on the empirical literature, we will test the efficacy of an embedded PCP model\n(experimental condition) in which PCPs are embedded within an oncology practice and will care for low-risk\nsurvivors who will be transitioned at 12 months post-treatment. These PCPs will be given training in cancer\nsurvivorship care focused on cancer surveillance and chronic disease prevention. This model will be compared\nto the extant oncology physician model (usual care) that is the default condition in this healthcare system. The\nprimary outcome will be receipt of guideline-recommended care (e.g., cancer surveillance, preventive care),\nassessed over a 36-month period. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated\nmeasures of patient-provider communication, care coordination, quality of life, self-efficacy in managing care,\nand other measures. We will also compare utilization of unplanned care (hospitalizations, urgent care) and\nreceipt of non-recommended care. We will explore PCP perceptions of confidence in delivery of survivorship\ncare.

The majority of these patients will enter into a prolonged post-treatment survivorship\nphase of care. However, we are currently facing unprecedented challenges in survivorship care delivery.\nSerious gaps in the care of survivors have been identified, including underuse of guideline-recommended\ncancer surveillance services, such as annual mammography for breast cancer survivors and colonoscopy for\ncolorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, and underuse of recommended preventive care services such as\nvaccinations, lipid testing and cardiovascular risk management, and disease screenings. Compounding these\nissues, our current oncology workforce is insufficient to care for the rapidly growing population of survivors.\nPrimary care provider (PCP)-led survivorship care is a feasible model of survivorship care. In observational\nstudies, survivors who receive care that involves PCPs received higher quality of care; international\nrandomized trials comparing PCP-led to oncology-led survivorship care have shown no significant differences\nin time to detection of cancer recurrence or quality of life for early-stage survivors. However, there is a paucity\nof high-quality research on models of survivorship care in the U.S, particularly in community-based settings,\nseriously limiting our ability to provide high-quality cancer survivorship care. To address these issues, we will\nconduct a prospective cluster randomized trial of two models of cancer survivorship care in early-stage, low-\nrisk breast cancer and CRC survivors cared for in a community-based, integrated health care setting. Building\non our pilot work and drawing on the empirical literature, we will test the efficacy of an embedded PCP model\n(experimental condition) in which PCPs are embedded within an oncology practice and will care for low-risk\nsurvivors who will be transitioned at 12 months post-treatment. These PCPs will be given training in cancer\nsurvivorship care focused on cancer surveillance and chronic disease prevention. This model will be compared\nto the extant oncology physician model (usual care) that is the default condition in this healthcare system. The\nprimary outcome will be receipt of guideline-recommended care (e.g., cancer surveillance, preventive care),\nassessed over a 36-month period. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated\nmeasures of patient-provider communication, care coordination, quality of life, self-efficacy in managing care,\nand other measures. We will also compare utilization of unplanned care (hospitalizations, urgent care) and\nreceipt of non-recommended care. We will explore PCP perceptions of confidence in delivery of survivorship\ncare. We will conduct this trial in 8 large, hospital-based medical centers of an integrated health care system,\nKaiser Permanente Southern California, with approximately 2,000 early-stage breast and CRC survivors. Our\nresults will provide more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of a scalable model of PCP-led survivorship\ncare, addressing the critical shortage of oncology providers while maintaining or improving quality.

However, HCT-related factors, such as total body irradiation used for conditioning,\ngraft-versus-host disease, and prolonged exposure to immunosuppressive therapy, result in very high risk for\nsubsequent skin cancers. Compared with the general population, HCT survivors are also more likely to develop\nskin cancers at a younger age, have advanced disease at presentation, and experience multiple recurrences.\nDespite this high burden, less than 20% of long-term HCT survivors report being examined for skin cancer, even\nthough >90% were seen by their primary care physician (PCPs) in the prior year. In HCT survivors, skin cancers\ndevelop at a time when their follow-up care has largely transitioned from oncology care to the primary care\nsetting, emphasizing the need to develop innovative strategies that 1) provide HCT survivors with the skills to\nconduct effective skin self-examinations, and prompt action from their providers when worrisome lesions are\nfound; 2) engage PCPs in HCT risk-based screening for skin cancer; and 3) ensure rapid access to dermatologic\nexams. Advances in technology, including widespread availability of cell phones and teledermoscopy (remote\nexpert assessment of a photographed lesion) offer promising opportunities to improve early detection and\ntreatment of skin cancer. We propose a comparative effectiveness study that will examine the impact of patient\nactivation and education (PAE), alone or in combination with physician-tailored strategies, on clinically\nmeaningful behavioral outcomes. We will enroll 720 HCT survivors at a large, diverse HCT center to:\n1) Determine the impact of PAE alone or with physician activation (PAE+Phys) on skin cancer screening and\nprevention practices at 12 months; and 2) Among PCPs of HCT survivors, determine the impact of a\nteledermoscopy e-learning program compared with provision of print materials for identifying suspect lesions.\nWe hypothesize that compared to PAE, patients randomized to PAE+Phys will report higher rates of thorough\nself- and provider skin exam, shorter time to referral of suspicious lesions, and improved quality of life; compared\nto print materials alone, physicians randomized to teledermoscopy e-learning will have greater recognition of\nsuspect lesions and more appropriate, cost-effective referral patterns. Our multi-disciplinary team will: 1)\nestablish the efficacy of PAE, and the relative benefit of physician activation; 2) inform the practice of skin cancer\nscreening using innovative mobile strategies that are readily applicable in the clinical setting; and 3) identify\nfacilitators of and barriers to appropriate delivery of survivorship-focused preventive care for long-term HCT\nsurvivors. Information obtained from the current study can be used to develop strategies for management of\nother late effects (e.g. cardiovascular, endocrine) in HCT survivors in the primary care setting, and to improve\nskin cancer screening in other high-risk (e.g. radiation-exposed) cancer survivor populations.

project	5R01CA249467-02	R01CA249467	10146986	2021	Optimizing Functional Outcomes of Older Survivors After Chemotherapy	Grant	Project Summary:\nThe overarching goal of this proposal, submitted in response to RFA-CA-19-035, is to evaluate if an aging-\nsensitive survivorship intervention improves outcomes valued by older adults and their caregivers\nduring the transition into survivorship from curative-intent chemotherapy. This proposal is important\nbecause by 2040, 73% of survivors will be aged 65+ and almost 50% will be aged 75+. Unfortunately, aging-\nrelated conditions (e.g., physical and cognitive function impairments) are not addressed routinely in survivorship\ncare. Preliminary research by all multiple principal investigators (MPIs: Mohile, Janelsins, Mustian) suggests that\na Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) intervention is effective for surveilling, triaging and managing\nphysical and cognitive impairments, improving patient and caregiver satisfaction, and fostering communication\nabout aging-related conditions during chemotherapy in older cancer patients and their caregivers. Preliminary\nresearch by MPIs also suggests that a Survivorship Health Promotion program is effective for improving physical\nfunction among older survivors after chemotherapy. Our MPI team has shown that GEM and Survivorship Health\nPromotion are feasible to implement in older patients, survivors and caregivers in nationwide samples recruited\nvia the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP)\nResearch Base network. To fill existing empirical gaps in survivorship care for older survivors and caregivers,\nwe created a novel intervention called Survivorship-GEM by combining these two very promising and synergistic\nprograms. Survivorship-GEM is directed by oncology advanced practice providers (APPs), because they\nroutinely direct care for survivors in the community. We propose to conduct a two-arm cluster randomized trial\ncomparing the efficacy of our novel Survivorship-GEM intervention to usual care for improving physical and\ncognitive function, satisfaction with care, completion of referral appointments, and hospitalizations among older\nsurvivors. We will also examine the effect of Survivorship-GEM on oncology APP communication with primary\ncare providers and on caregiver distress and satisfaction with care. We will randomize 30 NCORP community\noncology practices to two arms: 1) Survivorship-GEM or 2) usual care. Survivors aged 65+ (n=720) and\ncaregivers (if available, estimated n=500) will complete baseline assessments at the end of curative-intent\nchemotherapy for a solid tumor malignancy with follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Our uniquely qualified,\nmultidisciplinary team includes expertise in geriatrics, clinical trials, nursing, primary care, behavioral oncology,\nrehabilitation, health disparities, biostatistics, and implementation science. The team also benefits from\ncollaborations with the Cancer and Aging Research Group Advisory Board and the SCOREboard patient\nadvocate group. The APP-directed Survivorship-GEM intervention is highly innovative and has tremendous\npotential to improve outcomes in older survivors and caregivers by surveilling, triaging and managing the effects\nof chemotherapy and by fostering health promotion.

This research is critical because lung and colorectal cancer survivors\nhave high post-treatment needs, are older, and suffers from greater co-morbidities and poor quality of life\n(QOL). Lung and colorectal cancer survivors remain underrepresented in research, leading to significant\ndisparities in post-treatment outcomes. Based on the Chronic Care Self-Management Model (CCM), the SSM\nIntervention includes the following components: 1) care coordination and communication between oncology\nand primary care on surveillance/follow-up, health promotion, disease prevention, and comorbidity\nmanagement; 2) provision of clinician care plan to PCPs; 3) comprehensive patient/geriatric assessment for\nsurvivors of all ages; 4) personalized care plan for survivors; and 5) survivor self-management skills building\nfor surveillance/follow-up, late and long-term effects of treatments, comorbidities, and healthy living. It is\nadministered in five telehealth sessions (Zoom videoconferencing) and three subsequent maintenance\ntelehealth sessions for survivors who are four months post-treatment. We will test the efficacy of the SSM\nIntervention using a randomized design of attention control arm versus an intervention arm to pursue the\nfollowing specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (Primary): Determine the efficacy of the intervention on care\ncoordination, communication, and provider knowledge at 4 months post-accrual; Specific Aim 2 (Primary):\nDetermine the efficacy of the intervention on survivor outcomes at 4 months post-accrual; and Specific Aim 3\n(Exploratory): Assess the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the\nintervention. The RE-AIM Framework informs intervention delivery process, which will set the stage for future\nlarge scale implementation for sustainability in real-world care settings. This proposal is innovative because it\naddresses a critical need to improve care delivery and outcomes for high needs, understudied survivorship\npopulations (lung, colorectal, older survivors), and the telehealth approach promotes scalability. The\ninterdisciplinary team, which includes expertise in nursing science (Sun, Reb, Ferrell), oncology (Fakih), and\nprimary care (Kim) is uniquely suited to conduct this research. The proposal is significant, with high scientific\nrigor and outcomes that are of critical importance to survivors, clinicians, healthcare systems, the National\nCancer Institute, and the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM.

project	5R01CA249568-02	R01CA249568	10159878	2021	Onco-primary care networking to support TEAM-based care - the ONE TEAM Study	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nSince the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released the seminal report, From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor:\nLost in Transition 13 years ago, there has been substantial progress in understanding the health issues\naffecting cancer survivors, yet little has changed regarding survivorship care delivery. There remains a\ndisconnect between primary care providers and oncology care teams that has led to persistent problems\nimplementing risk-stratified survivorship care for cancer survivors.\nWith advances in cancer therapy and improved survival rates, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease\n(CVD) now exceeds that of the cancer for many survivors. While cancer therapy may contribute to this risk, it is\ngenerally a compilation of non-modifiable factors (i.e., genetics, aging), as well as modifiable lifestyle behaviors\n(i.e., diet, exercise) that lead to both the cancer and to cardiovascular disease (CVD). With the lack of primary\ncare provider (PCP) integration in the cancer care team and time constraints and difficulty keeping up with\nrapidly evolving non-cancer therapeutics for medical oncologists, there is an inferred lower priority for\ncomorbidity management.\nWe will determine the effectiveness of the multi-level iGuide intervention and the up-titrated iGuide2\nintervention compared with usual care on the primary outcomes. The theory-driven, self-guided iGuide\nintervention consists of patient-level components (video vignettes, patient-facing webinars) and PCP-level\ncomponents (electronic health record [EHR] automated cancer specialist-PCP letter, tele-education series, and\nautomated reminders). The up-titrated iGuide2 intervention consists of tailored patient-level video vignettes\nand targeted EHR specialist-PCP communication.\nThe primary outcomes of the ONE TEAM SMART-design study are (1) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and\nInformation Set (HEDIS) quality measures of management of the three CVD comorbidities (hypertension, type\n2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia) based upon laboratory and clinical measurement; (2) medication\nadherence assessed pharmacy refill data using Proportion of Days Covered (PDC); and (3) patient-provider\ncommunication (Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care). Secondary aims include exploring\nmoderating and mediating factors in each level of the intervention, support of patient-centered outcomes,\nhealth care use, measures of provider activation, and costs of care resulting from the multi-level intervention.\nThe overarching goal of this proposed project is to optimize the management and outcomes of individuals with\ncancer, both during and after treatment, and to develop a ‘low-touch’ multi-level intervention that can be\ngeneralized, adapted and scaled in other health care systems. The proposed ONE TEAM study brings together\na multi-disciplinary research team with the necessary expertise and experience in survivorship research,\npopulation and behavioral science, primary care, oncology, and biostatistics. Results from this intervention will\nhave important implications in the advancement of healthcare delivery for cancer survivors.

Such heterogeneity becomes a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment and personalized medicine. Because of this inherent heterogeneity, data collected from cancer cell population-averaged assays likely hides valuable but rare events such as dramatic variations in gene expression at the single cell level. Therefore, understanding cellular heterogeneity from cancer biospecimens, especially in the study of phenotype-genotype correlation, will facilitate identification of new cell subsets, and assist in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. In this proposal, we focus on developing a high throughput approach for single-cell isolation based on cells' capability in generating protrusions. To be able to retrieve the desired single adherent cell, a Protrusion Analysis Chip (PAC) is proposed, in which the single cell is captured by a single hook and physically isolated by a barrier. The PAC is rapid, operationally simple, highly efficient, and requires low-volume sample introduction. After adhesion and spreading, cell phenotype is identified microscopically and then the desired cell is retrieved for genotype analysis. The proposed technology developments and study plans may potentially strengthen the understanding of the relationship between phenotype and genotype at the single cell level.

project	5R21CA215968-02	R21CA215968	9527063	2018	Investigating developmental Hox programs as determinants of sarcomagenesis	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nHijacking of normal developmental programs is a common mechanism of tumorigenesis and deregulation\nof developmental HOX programs, in particular, contributes to the pathogenesis of leukemia, as well as\nsome solid tumors. We recently discovered that HOX gene expression is highly deregulated in Ewing\nsarcoma, an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor that has a peak incidence in adolescence. Specifically,\nthe posterior HOX genes, HOXD10, HOXD11 and HOXD13, are over-expressed compared to other\nnormal and malignant tissues, and down-regulation of HOXD13 in Ewing sarcoma cell lines results in a\ndramatic decrease in tumorigenicity. The expression of all Hox genes normally becomes restricted to\ndistinct regions of the developing musculoskeletal (MSK) system during embryonic development, with the\nposterior genes becoming restricted to the lumbosacral vertebrae, pelvis and developing forelimb and\nhindlimb – the dominant sites of Ewing sarcoma presentation clinically. Recent work from the Wellik\nlaboratory has shown that Hox-expressing cells arise as mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells (MSCs)\nduring embryonic development and persist as regionally-restricted MSCs through postnatal and adult\nstages. MSCs have been implicated as putative cells of origin for Ewing sarcoma, but the precise identity\nof the target cells, the molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation and a clear explanation of the\nregion-specific etiology of this tumor type remain poorly understood. Important for this application, the\nLawlor lab has shown that ectopic expression of the Ewing sarcoma driver oncogene, EWS/FLI1, in bulk\npopulations of MSCs initiates tumorigenesis and disrupts HOX gene expression as a result of epigenetic\nderegulation. These two key findings lead us to the novel hypothesis that EWS/FLI1-dependent disruption\nof the posterior HOX program in MSCs where these genes are developmentally and regionally expressed\n(i.e. the posterior skeleton) is central to Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis. We will determine the efficiency\nand latency of EWS/FLI1-induced tumor formation in Hox-expressing MSCs that are isolated from different\nanatomic sites and test the hypothesis that oncogenic transformation occurs more readily in MSC\npopulations where restricted, posterior Hox gene expression has been established. We will use\nHoxa11eGFP reporter mice to monitor ectopic induction of the posterior Hox program in transduced cells\nand their resultant tumors. Use of MSCs from control and Hox mutant mouse lines will allow us to\ndetermine if posterior Hox genes are functionally required for the transformation process in vivo as our in\nvitro data suggest. With the biochemical, molecular and in vivo genetic tools the two labs have developed,\nsuccessful demonstration of this novel hypothesis during this funding period will provide the basis for\nfuture highly impactful and mechanistic dissection of the etiology of Ewing's sarcoma, including a\nmolecular basis for understanding the regional specificity of this tumor in vivo.

Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:\nMolecular profiling – the practice of molecularly testing tumors in order to find specific gene or protein\nalterations which can be used to recommend targeted therapies – is increasingly used in oncology and is fast\nbecoming a major part of precision medicine. In practice, each patient or physician generally receives a list of\nmolecular anomalies and a list of therapies which are predicted to be beneficial or not beneficial based on the\ntumor molecular profile. This may lead to a difficult process of prioritizing therapies for individual patients. In\nthe current proposal, we will develop computational network-based approaches to therapy recommendation by\nusing existing resources to inform the connections between drugs and gene or protein variants. We will\nconsider approaches both for creating “average” networks based on population-level data and for creating\n“patient-specific” networks based on an individual’s specific tumor profile. We will also design and implement\nan interactive data visualization approach for these networks which will be usable by both clinical researchers\nand clinicians. The methods and tools developed as part of this project will be entirely reproducible and shared\nwith the community via open-source software packages and interactive tools. We believe our project could\neventually lead the way to improving the way therapies are targeted to cancer patients.

project	5R33CA191245-03	R33CA191245	9329382	2017	Noninvasive detection of circulating RNAs for lung cancer early detection and prognosis	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dismal rate of survival in lung cancer is primarily a result of late diagnosis, resistance to classical or targeted therapy, and post-treatment recurrence of disease. A patient-friendly early detection and prognosis method that detects cancer at an early stage, assesses response to treatment, and predicts risk of cancer recurrence would substantially reduce the mortality in this serious disease. Non-invasive 'liquid biopsy' relying on the detection of extracellular circulating RNAs (microRNAs and mRNAs) in patient blood samples has great potential to achieve this goal. Such biomarkers in serum/plasma can be sensitively quantified by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR of RNA isolated from the samples. However, this RNA isolation-qRT-PCR workflow cannot distinguish circulating RNAs secreted by cancer cells from those released physiologically and ubiquitously by all other, non-tumor cells of the body, making it potentially less sensitive or incapable of detecting cancer-specific RNA biomarkers. We recently developed a novel and simple tethered cationic lipoplex nanoparticle (tCLN) biochip with pre-loaded molecular beacons in the nanoparticles as probes to capture and detect cancer-specific RNAs in human serum without requiring pre- or post-sample processing. In this technology, negatively charged RNA molecules are easily captured by and fused with positively charged lipoplex nanoparticles, allowing their detection by the molecular beacons. Since both RNA targets and molecular beacons are confined within nanometer-sized liposome particles in a detection volume that is 1012 times smaller than that of a PCR reaction, this method not only provides very high detection sensitivity but also forfends the need for target amplification that qRT-PCR requires. We have demonstrated the feasibility of the tCLN biochip in detecting and quantifying extracellular miR-21 and let-7g microRNAs and Thyroid Transcription Factor-1 (TTF-1) mRNA in serum of lung cancer patients. The tCLN biochip could thus successfully distinguish early stage lung cancer patients from normal healthy controls, whereas the serum RNA isolation-qRT-PCR workflow was found to be completely ineffective for the task. We have assembled a strong multi-disciplinary team to further develop the tCLN biochip and to validate its feasibility using serum samples from smokers at high risk for developing lung cancer and from lung cancer patients. Our primary objectives are (1) to optimize the current tCLN biochip technology and to develop a microfluidic CLN (mCLN) biochip as a point-of-care diagnostic device; (2) to evaluate the performance of tCLN and mCLN biochips as a diagnostic tool for identifying lung cancer among individuals with computed tomography (CT)-detected solitary pulmonary nodules; and, (3) to evaluate the performance of tCLN and mCLN biochips as a prognostic tool using serum samples collected from early stage lung cancer patients before and at various time-points following surgical resection of cancer. We will also compare the tCLN and mCLN biochips with the traditional serum RNA isolation-qRT-PCR workflow for serum RNA detection sensitivity and specificity.

project	5R33CA192980-03	R33CA192980	9269176	2017	Advanced development and validation of targeted molecular counting methods for precise and ultrasensitive quantitation of low prevalence somatic mutations	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultrasensitive detection of clinically relevant somatic alterations in cancer genomes has great potential for impacting patient care, e.g. for early detection, establishing diagnoses, refining prognoses, guiding treatment, and monitoring recurrence. However, current technologies are poorly suited to the robust detection of somatic mutations present at very low frequencies (<1%). Massively parallel sequencing represents an advantageous path forward, but its sensitivity to detect very rare events is fundamentally constrained by the sequencing error rate. We have recently developed a new experimental paradigm that overcomes this limitation. In our approach, each copy of a target sequence that is present in a sample is molecularly tagged during the first cycle of a multiplex capture reaction with a unique random sequence. After amplification, target amplicons and their corresponding molecular tags are subjected to massively parallel sequencing. During analysis, the molecular tags are used to associate sequence reads sharing a common origin. Through oversampling, reads bearing the same molecular tag error-correct one another to yield an independent haploid consensus for each progenitor molecule. Furthermore, the collapsing of commonly derived reads inherently corrects for any allele-specific bias during amplification, such that estimates of\nmutant allele frequency can be accompanied by precise confidence bounds ("molecular counting"). Among other benefits, the approach is sensitive to at least 1 mutated sequence in a background of 10,000 unmutated copies. Here we propose the advanced development and validation of this approach for use as a clinical diagnostic. In our first aim, we will develop a multiplexed panel to broadly target common cancer associated mutations using this technology. In our second aim, we will apply the panel to the detection of minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia as a prognostic marker of disease relapse. In our third aim, we will apply the panel to detection of ultra-rare mutations in circulating cell-free DNA, which is released into circulation from dying tumor cells, as a robust and non-invasive cancer diagnostic. The panel will be rigorously validated for clinical use in both aims, with performance metrics appropriately designed for the two separate analytes. The availability of robust, cost-effective, quantitative, and generically applicable tools for the ultrasensitive, multiplex detection of rare somatic events\nin the clinical setting will provide enhanced, transformative capabilities in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancers. The methodology will also have application to basic science cancer research.

project	5R33CA202881-02	R33CA202881	9450486	2018	Cancer histology and QC via MUSE: Sample-sparing UV surface-excitation microscopy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY: Pathology—determining the causes and effects of disease, often by using a\nmicroscope to examine patients' tissue—is essential for arriving at a correct cancer diagnosis, but it has\nbecome increasingly important to submit relevant portions of often tiny tissue samples for DNA and other\nmolecular and functional tests. Making sure that the submitted material actually contains tumor, in sufficient\nquantity, is not always easy, and sometimes just preparing conventional microscope slides can consume most\nor even the entire specimen. We have developed a new, simple and inexpensive approach we term MUSE, for\nMicroscopy with UV Surface Excitation, that can provide high-resolution images directly and quickly from fresh\ntissue without consuming it, and thus can preserve intact, high-quality specimens for biobanking, downstream\nmolecular and functional analyses.\n MUSE, by ensuring that acquired small biopsy specimens are indeed fit for purpose, can avoid the\nneed to have a patient return at a later date for additional biopsies. In addition, the method will allow for lesion\ndetection over larger cross-sections of tissue, such as organ whole-mounts, not currently practical with\nconventional instrumentation. Finally, we expect that MUSE will yield additional biologically informative imaging\nby avoiding artifacts inherent in conventional tissue processing and sectioning. We focus here on facilitation of\ntissue-based molecular studies, viable tumor harvest for xenografts and cultured spheroids, and biobanking,\nand include crucial validation studies to ensure that the MUSE process does not compromise sample utility due\nto possible impacts from exposure to intercalating dyes and/or UV light.\n MUSE relies on two mechanisms: 1) surface-restricted excitation of fluorescent dyes due to micron-\nscale penetration of sub-300-nm ultraviolet light; and 2) the fact that many conventional dyes excited in this\nway emit visible light. These signals are bright enough to be detected by conventional color cameras using\nsub-second exposure times, allowing rapid imaging of large areas.\n MUSE eliminates any requirement for conventional histology processing with formalin fixation, paraffin\nembedding, or thin-sectioning.

project	5R33CA202881-03	R33CA202881	9656934	2019	Cancer histology and QC via MUSE: Sample-sparing UV surface-excitation microscopy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY: Pathology—determining the causes and effects of disease, often by using a\nmicroscope to examine patients' tissue—is essential for arriving at a correct cancer diagnosis, but it has\nbecome increasingly important to submit relevant portions of often tiny tissue samples for DNA and other\nmolecular and functional tests. Making sure that the submitted material actually contains tumor, in sufficient\nquantity, is not always easy, and sometimes just preparing conventional microscope slides can consume most\nor even the entire specimen. We have developed a new, simple and inexpensive approach we term MUSE, for\nMicroscopy with UV Surface Excitation, that can provide high-resolution images directly and quickly from fresh\ntissue without consuming it, and thus can preserve intact, high-quality specimens for biobanking, downstream\nmolecular and functional analyses.\n MUSE, by ensuring that acquired small biopsy specimens are indeed fit for purpose, can avoid the\nneed to have a patient return at a later date for additional biopsies. In addition, the method will allow for lesion\ndetection over larger cross-sections of tissue, such as organ whole-mounts, not currently practical with\nconventional instrumentation. Finally, we expect that MUSE will yield additional biologically informative imaging\nby avoiding artifacts inherent in conventional tissue processing and sectioning. We focus here on facilitation of\ntissue-based molecular studies, viable tumor harvest for xenografts and cultured spheroids, and biobanking,\nand include crucial validation studies to ensure that the MUSE process does not compromise sample utility due\nto possible impacts from exposure to intercalating dyes and/or UV light.\n MUSE relies on two mechanisms: 1) surface-restricted excitation of fluorescent dyes due to micron-\nscale penetration of sub-300-nm ultraviolet light; and 2) the fact that many conventional dyes excited in this\nway emit visible light. These signals are bright enough to be detected by conventional color cameras using\nsub-second exposure times, allowing rapid imaging of large areas.\n MUSE eliminates any requirement for conventional histology processing with formalin fixation, paraffin\nembedding, or thin-sectioning. It requires no lasers, confocal, multiphoton or optical coherence tomography\ninstrumentation, can eventually cost in the range of a few thousands of dollars, and therefore affordable at the\npoint of care (point of biopsy). MUSE samples are stained within seconds using familiar histology stains, such\nas eosin and DAPI, and the resulting high-resolution images converted from fluorescence to H&E-like\nbrightfield appearance for interpretation in real time (but with novel and potentially useful features) easily\ninterpreted by pathologists.\n While rapid cellular-scale imaging of fresh tissue can have significant benefits in clinical arenas, it can\nalso empower basic and translational research use for essentially instant histology-, pathology- or\ntoxicology-relevant images directly from experimental animal models—at the bench—and may help relieve\nsuch investigators from having to rely on often overworked, sometimes unavailable, conventional histology and\npathology services.

Around 95% of new anticancer drugs eventually fail in clinical trial\ndespite robust indications of activity in existing in vitro pre-clinical models, making in vitro testing some of the\nleast predictive. Three dimensional (3D) spheroid culture models have recently advanced to bridge the “in-\nvitro to in-vivo gap” and provide the means for assembling more complex cancer relevant tissue\nmicroenvironments. Although these 3D models are being adopted by industry and the academic community,\nthey have limitations and are hampered by low throughput, lack of consistency, high costs and the need for\nclinical validation. The Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (SRIMSC) in partnership with\nn3D Biosciences Inc., Greiner Bio-One USA Inc., Dr. Derek Duckett at Scripps Research department of\nMolecular Therapeutics and Dr. David Tuveson, M.D, Ph.D. at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), have\ncreated a strategic collaboration to advance a novel technology known as 3D magnetic bioprinting. Magnetic\n3D bioprinting addresses the these critical issues by utilizing n3D's core technology known as the NanoShuttle\nto levitate and aggregate cells using magnetic forces to produce spheroids/organoids. The ultimate end\nproduct will be an affordable; HTS validated 384 and 1536 microplate format that supports rapid/consistent\nproduction of 3D spheroids for a wide array of cell types including primary tumor lines. The end goal is to\naccelerate 3D spheroid cultivation using screening automation, improve cost efficiency and allow for rapid drug\ntesting such as FDA approved drugs in reformulation/repurposing studies. Advancement of this technology will\nbe facilitated through the following: Aim 1: Validation of the current 384 well plate nanosphere technology in a\nHTS facility for automation compatibility. Compare 3D results to 2D models of KRAS pancreatic cancer cell\nmodels as provided by Dr. Tuveson. Aim 2: Validation of n3D spheroid technology for drug testing against\nselect cytotoxic drugs, NCI approved oncology drug set and the Scripps FDA Approved drug collection. CC50\ndata, i.e. the concentration that produces 50% cellular cytotoxicity, in 2D and in 3D formats will be compared to\npublished literature. Aim 3: n3D Biosciences will produce an advance 1536 well plate NanoShuttle driver\ncompatible for HTS and drug discovery efforts. SRIMSC will evaluate and implement the higher density format\nfor drug discovery utility which will culminate in its testing on a large library of ~150K compounds to\ndemonstrate HTS readiness. Aim 4: The n3D spheroid technology will be employed against patient derived\nprimary Glioblastoma Multiform (GBM) derived cells with the end goal of evaluating its utility in primary cancer\ncell research. Aim 5: The n3D spheroid technology will be evaluated in-vivo for pancreatic orthotopic tumor\neffect and its utility in preclinical research.

Despite the introduction of a number of novel treatments MM\npatients still are confronted with an average survival time of 5-7 years. Emerging evidence suggests\nthat the endosteal niche at the bone-BM interface fosters the survival of drug-resistant MM cells,\nespecially through adhesive interactions with osteoblasts, and is therefore responsible for relapse.\nCurrently, treatment options for MM patients are evaluated mainly on the basis of clinical features and\nhistorical population response rates. Therefore, an important unmet clinical need is to develop the\nability to select the best therapy for an individual based on the ex vivo response of the patient's MM\ncells (PMMCs) to drug treatment options. This precision medicine approach is expected to provide a\ntransformative means of: (1) reducing ineffective therapies, (2) minimizing excess toxicity and cost,\n(3) inhibiting the development of the tumor cells' cross-resistance to additional drugs as a critical part\nof the long-term care of MM patients, and (4) assessing the probability of relapse occurrence. A\nmajor challenge, however, is the lack of clinically relevant, high-throughput and inexpensive models\nthat preserve primary patient biospecimen for downstream analyses and use. The goal of this R33\nproject is to improve and validate a multiple myeloma (MM) culture platform, which was developed\nthrough the prior R21 award to enable the ex vivo preservation of PMMCs derived from BM\nbiospecimens.

Anticipated results will validate that ex vivo preserved MM\nbiospecimens can be widely used with our culture platform for screening patient-specific treatment\noptions as well as for other applications such as preclinical evaluation of new therapeutics, studying\ndrug-resistant PMMC populations, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and ex vivo models of breast\nand prostate cancers that metastasize to BM and bone.

In particular, non-\nneuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an aggressive form of this\ndisease, is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The main barriers against\ntherapeutic advances are a paucity of relevant disease models and a very poor understanding of the\nmechanisms that give rise to this phenotype. The process of protein synthesis has long been considered\nsubordinate to alterations at the levels of DNA and RNA in cancer etiology. However, work from our laboratory\nand others have revealed that protein synthesis control is a dynamic process that coordinates not only bulk\nmRNA translation, but also the specialized translation of distinct mRNAs important for cancer phenotypes.\nRecently, our laboratory has developed and characterized a new in vitro and in vivo toolkit of both human and\nmurine androgen receptor-low CRPC. We have used these models to discover a critical link between androgen\nreceptor signaling and the process of mRNA translation initiation, which is critical for androgen receptor-low\nCRPC growth. We hypothesize that androgen receptor-low CRPC is driven by the specific translation of\ndistinct mRNA networks, thereby leading to persistent tumor growth, which may represent a therapeutic\nvulnerability. Our long-term objective is to utilize state-of-the-art mouse models, ribosome profiling, and patient\nderived xenografts to definitively investigate the fundamental link between the androgen receptor and protein\nsynthesis control in a highly relevant and newly emerging disease course for prostate cancer patients.

project	5R37CA230617-04	R37CA230617	10311029	2022	Hormone signaling and translation control in advanced prostate cancer	Grant	ABSTRACT\nThe recent advent of highly potent inhibitors of the androgen receptor and androgen biosynthesis has had the\nunfortunate iatrogenic effect of fueling new lethal prostate cancer phenotypes in patients. In particular, non-\nneuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an aggressive form of this\ndisease, is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The main barriers against\ntherapeutic advances are a paucity of relevant disease models and a very poor understanding of the\nmechanisms that give rise to this phenotype. The process of protein synthesis has long been considered\nsubordinate to alterations at the levels of DNA and RNA in cancer etiology. However, work from our laboratory\nand others have revealed that protein synthesis control is a dynamic process that coordinates not only bulk\nmRNA translation, but also the specialized translation of distinct mRNAs important for cancer phenotypes.\nRecently, our laboratory has developed and characterized a new in vitro and in vivo toolkit of both human and\nmurine androgen receptor-low CRPC. We have used these models to discover a critical link between androgen\nreceptor signaling and the process of mRNA translation initiation, which is critical for androgen receptor-low\nCRPC growth. We hypothesize that androgen receptor-low CRPC is driven by the specific translation of\ndistinct mRNA networks, thereby leading to persistent tumor growth, which may represent a therapeutic\nvulnerability. Our long-term objective is to utilize state-of-the-art mouse models, ribosome profiling, and patient\nderived xenografts to definitively investigate the fundamental link between the androgen receptor and protein\nsynthesis control in a highly relevant and newly emerging disease course for prostate cancer patients. To do\nso, we will address the following aims: 1) determine the mechanism by which the androgen receptor\ncommunicates with the translation apparatus, 2) delineate how aberrant protein synthesis drives the translation\nof distinct oncogenic mRNAs, and 3) elucidate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting translation initiation in\nandrogen receptor-low CRPC.\nUltimately, these studies are poised to uncover a new paradigm for gene regulation in androgen receptor-low\nprostate cancer and provide the preclinical basis for targeting the protein synthesis apparatus in an\nincreasingly common highly aggressive disease.

project	5R42CA228875-03	R42CA228875	9998915	2020	Targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells with custom-designed viral vectors	Grant	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of adult brain cancers with a median survival of <15 months\ndespite aggressive standard chemoradiation. GBM are formed by GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) - a major\ncontributor to tumor recurrence and a natural focus for therapeutic development. There are two main reasons\nresponsible for treatment failure: 1) high intra- and inter-tumor cellular and molecular heterogeneity with\nmultiple subclones possessing distinct genetic determinants; 2) GSCs exhibit multiple redundant signaling\npathways requiring simultaneous targeting of overlapping pathways. We have invented and biologically\nvalidated a novel tandem computational platform, GeneRep-nSCORE that integrates large-scale gene\nexpression profiles with genomic changes to identify common founding alterations or master regulators of\nGSCs that span a large number, if not all, GSC subclones within and across GBM tumors. We discovered such\na core set of four common master regulators in GCSs that are outstanding targets for clinical development.\nExpression of these four factors was sufficient to reprogram normal astrocytes to GSCs, whereas their\ndepletion profoundly abrogated GSCs, and thus tumor development in vivo, in all eight lines of patient-derived\nGSCs of varied genetic and molecular backgrounds examined to date.\nThe goal of this application is to develop a customized set of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based genetic\ntools to target the whole spectrum of GSCs (Phase I) for the purpose of delivering targeting constructs to\ndeplete the four common master regulators responsible for malignant transformation and proliferation in GSCs\n(Phase II). The specific objectives of this proposal are: (i) using directed evolution and available combinatorial\nAAV capsid library, and for the first time, introducing a dynamic mode of administration of a library reagent\nover the time course of tumor progression, to greatly increase the probability of identifying novel AAV variants\nspecifically targeting slow-, and fast-cycling GSCs in patient-derived xenograft models (PDX) (Phase I); (ii) To\ndesign and validate a panel of AAV vectors that express shRNAs targeting core master regulators of GSCs to\nidentify leads for preclinical testing; (iii) To optimize modes of viral delivery, pharmacokinetics and\npharmacodynamics parameters, and safety and toxicity in normal and PDX treated with lead targeting AAV\ncassettes; and (iv) Based on these results, tools and basic DMPK data created, to conduct preclinical efficacy\nstudies in PDX treated with lead targeting AAV cassettes either alone or in combination with standard\nchemoradiotherapy (Phase II) to prepare for an investigative new drug application for clinical testing in patients\nwith GBM, and for commercial development of this novel technology.

project	5R44CA199826-03	R44CA199826	9534548	2018	Commercialization of an MRI contrast agent for differential diagnosis of prostate cancer.	Grant	Abstract\n Prostate cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and the second most cause of cancer death of\nmen in the US. Current methods to assess prostate cancer risk combine prostate specific antigen (PSA)\nscreening and random prostate biopsy. Unfortunately, this strategy fails to reveal the lesion’s location and\ndoes not accurately differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers. As a result,\nmost patients will receive unnecessary active treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in order to avoid\nunder treatment. Active treatment involves surgery or radiation, often causing long-term side effects such\nas urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel urgency. Thus, development of non-invasive and\naccurate diagnostic imaging technology to localize and differentiate high-risk prostate cancer offer a new\ntool to assist physicians in risk-stratification and decision making and to spare millions patients with low-\nrisk cancer from unnecessary aggressive treatment.\n The mission of Molecular Theranostics (fka Prostate Theranostics) is to commercialize a novel\nmolecular imaging approach that targets an oncoprotein associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal\ntransition (EMT), cancer cell stemness, angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. The oncoprotein has\na high expression in the tumor extracellular matrix of high-risk prostate cancer, low in low-grade tumor,\nnone in normal tissues. The goal of this project is to commercialize a safe and effective targeted contrast\nagent for accurate early detection, localization, and differential diagnosis of high-risk prostate cancer with\nMRI. In phase I, we have optimized and identified a lead targeted MRI contrast agent for clinical\ntranslation. All of the milestones in Phase I of the project have been achieved. The agent possesses the\nsuperior ability of robust specific contrast enhancement in high-risk prostate cancer, not in slow growing\nlow-risk tumors in animal models, and has the potential to visualize and differentiate high-risk prostate\ncancers with MRI.\n The objectives of this SBIR Phase II are to develop a lead formulation of the contrast agent, to\nperform FDA required eIND enabling studies, and to commercialize the agent for clinical imaging prostate\ncancer. The specific aims are 1) to scale up the synthesis of the targeted contrast agent and develop a\nlead product formulation for pre-clinical study and clinical trials; 2) to validate the effectiveness of the\nformulation for prostate cancer imaging on a clinical MRI scanner and to determine its minimally effective\ndose; 3) to perform eIND-enabling pharmacokinetics and safety studies in rodents. Non-invasive accurate\ndetection of prostate cancer is an unmet clinical need for prostate cancer management. Clinical trials will\nbe initiated as soon as the eIND is approved by the FDA. Successful development of our imaging\ntechnology has the potential to accurately detect, localize, and diagnose prostate cancer, replace\ninvasive prostate biopsy, and improve decision-making in clinical management of prostate cancer. It also\nhas the potential for non-invasive active surveillance of prostate cancer and timely monitoring of disease\nprogression, as well as image-guided therapy.

project	5R44CA216539-03	R44CA216539	9560694	2018	A Novel PET Probe for Use in Cancer Diagnostics	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nPositron Emission Tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that utilizes radiolabeled molecules\n(“probes”) to target and measure biological processes. Researchers can use the same probes to examine\nmicroorganisms, cells, and mice as they do in patients to visualize and characterize the biology of disease,\nmonitor its progression, and evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Over 4000+ PET probes have been developed to\nhelp answer a variety of biological questions, but only the glucose analog [18F]FDG is routinely used for\nmolecular imaging diagnostics in patient care. There is still an unmet need to develop additional probes which\ncan annotate other key aspects of cancer biochemistry, including those in which the diagnostics share\ncommon targets with drugs, to truly establish it as a key technology for realizing improved treatment and\nmonitoring in personalized medicine. The clinical translation of next generation PET probes is hampered by a\nlack of multi-site infrastructure to robustly, reliably, and cost-effectively support their supply to fulfill the initial\ndata generation required to determine safety and efficacy in humans. This is often a key issue in bridging the\n“gap” between proof-of-concept research and FDA approval; Pharma and Biotech, who face increasing\npressure to use diagnostics to develop drugs more efficiently, require significant validation studies and a\nreliable supply to realize the value of a novel PET probe to their clinical program and invest in future studies.\nThus, early clinical studies in this gap are currently relegated to single-site production, or must undergo a cost-\nand-time-prohibitive assimilation into a commercial radiopharmacy before they've been clinically vetted.\nTo facilitate a paradigm shift in the enablement of novel PET probes for the clinical trial community, a\nfundamental change in production ideology and infrastructure re-imagining is required. Creating a network of\nacademic radiochemistry cores that standardize and share synthesis, purification, formulation, and quality\ncontrol protocols through automation and cloud-based applications for clinical production serves to reduce\nbarriers to translating PET probes from the preclinical research environment to first-in-human studies, as well\nenable rapid dissemination of PET probes across multiple sites to spur and de-risk academic and industry\ncollaboration. The overall goal of this proposal is to establish and deploy a novel, low cost, scalable\napproach to the clinical translation of a next generation PET probes for cancer, starting with candidate\nprobe [18F]CFA, with potential commercialization as a predictive response biomarker for cancer\nimmunotherapies in solid tumors (i.e. CTLA-4/PD1 blockade), a pharmacodynamic biomarker for dCK\ninhibitors, and a predictive response biomarker for chemotherapy nucleoside prodrugs.

project	5R44CA217528-03	R44CA217528	9786678	2019	Novel Fluorescent Diagnostic Agents for Detection, Staging, andIntraoperative Imaging of Tumors	Grant	Abstract\nThe goal of this project is to develop IV injectable fluorescent agents for use in intraoperative\nimaging of peritoneal metastatic tumors. Significance: Peritoneal metastatic cancers have an\nincidence of 250,000/per year in the US and are primarily treated with surgery. Complete surgical\ntumor resection is a gold-standard treatment goal that can increase the 5-year patient survival to\n50%, whereas incomplete tumor resection (<2mm) could drastically reduce the survival to a mere\nfew months. Current clinical imaging technologies such as PET, MRI and CT have limitations for\nguiding cancer surgery including inability to be used intraoperatively due to safety associated with\nionizing radiation, as well as limitations on sensitivity and tumor specificity especially for lesions\nsmaller than 10mm. Conventional fluorescent molecular probes in development typically target\ntumor proteins and are limited in imaging the heterogeneous onco-geno-phenotypes of peritoneal\nmetastasis that have multiple tissues of origin and vary in protein expression levels. In order to\nreduce incomplete tumor resection and improve survival, there is an urgent need for clear visual\ncontrast imaging agents that enable more precise and specific detection of peritoneal metastasis\ntumors intraoperatively and in real-time. Hypothesis: OncoNano’s approach of targeting tumor\nacidosis which is ubiquitously expressed as a cancer biomarker across tumors, coupled with\nOncoNano’s ultra-sensitive pH fluorescent digital sensors, provides a broad based approach to\nimage the heterogeneous peritoneal metastasis with high specificity and sensitivity. Preliminary\nData: We have demonstrated that OncoNano’s fluorescent agents image tumors across a variety\nof solid tumor types (14 tested to date), including peritoneal metastasis to submillimeter precision\nin SCID mouse models. OncoNano’s agents provided a digital (ON-OFF) response which offered\nclear tumor delineation, and lower detection limits (>10x) compared with state of the art PET-FDG\nimaging. Surgical tumor resection using OncoNano imaging agent showed significant (40-50%)\nsurvival benefit in SCID mouse models compared with conventional white light based surgery.\nSpecific Aims: The scientific aims of this project will enable OncoNano to clinically translate, the\nultrasensitive pH probes and develop it from the lab bench through to establishing reproducible\nmanufacturing of a stable formulation, to establishing safety and pharmacology, for an FDA IND\nfiling.

project	5R44CA221624-02	R44CA221624	9568748	2018	Monitoring immune response to immunotherapies in cancer patients with VisAcT PET tracer	Grant	Abstract\nCellSight is a clinical stage company developing PET imaging tools that can increase the\nprobability of clinical success of immunotherapies by determining early in the therapeutic\nregimen if the cancer patient is responding to their immunotherapy. Cancer\nimmunotherapies that harness the body's immune system to help fight cancer do not\nwork for everyone; in fact, success rates can be as low as 20%. This means that up to\n80% of patients undergoing immunotherapy are spending over $100,000 and investing 6\nto 10 months on ineffective treatments. Our lead imaging tracer, [18F]-FAraG product\nnamed VisAcT, leverages existing health and PET imaging infrastructure but is specific\nfor visualizing immune response. This whole body visualization will provide clinicians\ncritical information to help make early decisions in the treatment regimen and increase\nchances of patient survival.\nCellSight is partnering with pharma and academia on various projects to validate this\ncritically needed immune response monitoring tool as immunotherapies and\ncombinational therapies are showing great promise. The sheer number of combinations\nare staggering yet there are no blood biomarkers or imaging tools available that can be\npredictive of responders versus nonresponders. Even if accurate blood biomarkers were\nto became available in the near future, whole body imaging will still be critically needed\nto determine local immune response site by site in the metastatic patient who are the\nones being administered immunotherapies. Clinical symptoms during immunotherapy\nare very perplexing, as it might seem a patient is progressing when in fact their immune\nsystem is actively fighting the cancer or there might be a delay before immune response\nis apparent through traditional measures. An immune response monitoring tool, such as\nVisAcT, will be key in enabling success for immunotherapies.\nVisAcT was first discovered and developed in the Gambhir lab (Chair of Radiology at\nStanford) and is exclusively licensed to CellSight. CellSight has obtained an IND\nprimarily through funding from the NCI. We are currently conducting Phase 1 clinical\ntrials at University of California San Francisco for various solid tumors including\nMelanoma, Lung and Bladder under Drs, Daud, Gubens and Fong respectively and are\nabout to launch a Head/Neck cancer trial at Stanford under Dr. Colevas. Our primary\ntarget market is the immuno-oncology market however since the tracer shows immune\nresponse that is specific to activated T cells it can be useful for other immune modulated\ndiseases such as Graft vs Host Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Our team, including Michael Karin, Ph.D. and Shabnam Shalapour, Ph.D. at UCSD School of Medicine\nand Hidekazu Tsukamoto, D.V.M., Ph.D. and Anthony El-Khoueiry, M.D. at USC Keck School of Medicine,\nrepresents an ideal blend of basic researchers, translational scientists and oncologists who are interested in\nHCC molecular pathogenesis and treatment, especially in HCC caused by non-alcoholic (NASH) and alcoholic\n(ASH) steatohepatitis. Although the US incidence of HCC and its associated mortality have nearly tripled in the\npast generation, insufficient effort has been made toward identification and development of innovative and\neffective HCC therapies. However, the ideal and timely confluence of basic preclinical research and applied\nclinical studies carried out by our team members has the potential to critically transform HCC treatment forever.\nTogether we found that chronic liver inflammation results in suppression of HCC-protective immunosurveillance\nto support rapid malignant progression. This unique immunopathogenic mechanism renders HCC responsive to\ndrugs that disrupt the PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint, but even the impressive response seen thus far and the selection\nof patients who will benefit from this therapeutic approach can be further improved. Such improvements can only\nbe achieved by a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitors act, the factors\nthat determine their efficacy, and the causes of treatment failure. We will achieve these goals through integrated\nstudies of clinical specimens collected by Dr. El-Khoueiry and sophisticated, faithful and robust mouse models\nof non-viral HCC developed by Drs. Tsukamoto, Shalapour, and Karin. The immune mechanisms that control\nNASH- and ASH-driven HCC development in these models are highly similar to those that operate in human\npatients. Using this integrated approach, we will pursue five specific aims: 1) determine whether serum IgA\nconcentrations correlate with therapeutic response to PD-1 blockade in patients with non-viral HCC; 2) develop\nreliable mouse models of ASH-driven HCC; 3) compare the immunosuppressive mechanisms that contribute to\ndevelopment of NASH- and ASH-driven HCC and control their response to PD-L1 blockade; 4) determine\nwhether excessive peritumoral fibrosis correlates with diminished response to PD-1 blockade in HCC patients;\nand 5) determine whether agents that inhibit or attenuate stellate cell activation potentiate the response to PD-\n1/PD-L1 blockade in non-viral HCC. The successful completion of these studies will result in substantial\nimprovements to HCC immunotherapy and will establish reliable procedures for identification of patients who are\nmost likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 targeting drugs, advances that will result in significant cost savings which\nmay amount to hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

Grant	U01 Abstract\nDespite extensive research into cancer immunotherapy, immune-related adverse events (irAE)\nremain a critical and poorly understood issue. To address this critical need, we have assembled a\nmultidisciplinary research team with broad and relevant expertise. The co-PIs of this proposal have\nexpertise in cancer immunotherapy, immunology, assay development, and bioinformatics. Together, we\nhave assembled a cohort of ~400 cancer patients treated with ICI, collecting longitudinal treatment, efficacy,\nand toxicity data, as well as blood samples at pre-treatment baseline, throughout therapy, and at time of\ntoxicity. In our real-world data set, over 10 percent of cases have a history of autoimmune disease,\nproviding insight into use of ICI in a population widely excluded from clinical trials yet routinely treated with\nthese therapies off protocol. Our high-quality clinical data annotation—without which correlative studies\nhave little meaning—addresses the reality that irAE may occur months after ICI initiation and are far more\ncomplex to detect and characterize than toxicities of conventional chemotherapy or molecularly targeted\ntherapies. Through existing funding mechanisms, we have already completed autoantibody, cytokine,\ngenetic, and functional assays in these cases. However, we do not currently have resources for\ncomprehensive, integrated analysis of these diverse laboratory and clinical data. The overarching goal of\nthis U01 proposal is to determine the optimal balance between ICI efficacy and toxicity, ultimately\nidentifying a set of biomarkers useful for selection of patients, treatment type and duration, and\nclinical monitoring. We will achieve this through determination of cellular immunity, comprehensive data\nanalysis, and clinical validation. We have three Aims: (1) Determine cellular immunity in patients\nexperiencing irAE and/or achieving beneficial responses from ICI. We will perform mass cytometry\n(CyTOF) and T-cell receptor sequencing at multiple time-points. (2) Determine genetic, humoral, and\ncellular factors associated with irAE and/or beneficial responses from ICI. We will develop a database\nto integrate and analyze the CyTOF and T-cell receptor sequencing data with clinical efficacy and toxicity\ndata, as well as data from the assays already completed through other mechanisms. (3) Perform analytical\nand clinical validation of emerging biomarkers. We will apply the best classifying phenotypes emerging\nfrom our comprehensive and integrated data analysis to a test set of patients from our existing cohort,\neventually identifying a subset of biomarkers with potential for clinical application. Together, these Aims\ndirectly address the FOA purpose of reducing the incidence and/or severity of irAE while retaining anti-\ntumor efficacy.

project	5U01CA164973-07	U01CA164973	9567089	2018	Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study	Grant	This renewal application seeks support for the infrastructure of the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study, which was\nestablished in Hawaii and southern California in 1993-1996 to study risk factors for cancer and other chronic\ndiseases. The study was designed to take advantage of the ethnic and cultural diversity of the two geographic\nareas, as well as the expertise of the investigators in nutrition, ethnic/racial studies, and genetics. It is the most\nethnically diverse cancer cohort in existence. It achieves high cost-efficiency by supplementing active follow-up\ninformation with computerized linkages to SEER, vital statistics, hospital-discharge diagnoses, medical claim\ndata, electronic medical records and geospatial information. At baseline, the cohort included information on\n215,000 men and women, comprised almost entirely of five ethnic/racial populations: Caucasians, Japanese\nAmericans, Native Hawaiians, African Americans, and Latinos. The resource was later expanded to include a\nprospective biorepository of blood and urine specimens from ~70,000 of the participants. Leadership of the\nMEC entails a highly interactive, team approach; and the investigators have amply demonstrated their\nwillingness to share data/samples, and to participate actively in consortia. This application describes our aims\nover the next 5 years for maintaining and enhancing the infrastructure of the MEC, as well as plans for\nmethodological research. Research accomplishments include significant contributions to understanding both\ngenetic and environmental risk factors for cancer. Over 280 papers describing our findings have been\npublished during the current grant cycle. In addition, over the last 20 years, 98 research grants have been built\naround the MEC, and more than 75 students and postdoctoral fellows have been trained on the study.

It achieves high cost-efficiency by supplementing active follow-up\ninformation with computerized linkages to SEER, vital statistics, hospital-discharge diagnoses, medical claim\ndata, electronic medical records and geospatial information. At baseline, the cohort included information on\n215,000 men and women, comprised almost entirely of five ethnic/racial populations: Caucasians, Japanese\nAmericans, Native Hawaiians, African Americans, and Latinos. The resource was later expanded to include a\nprospective biorepository of blood and urine specimens from ~70,000 of the participants.

New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually-transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, represent tremendous opportunities for innovative and efficient cervical cancer programs in the U.S. but also pose significant challenges for decision making, due to the complex and long natural history of disease and the different time points along the disease spectrum at which interventions are applied. Consequently, policy makers are uniquely reliant on mathematical modeling to provide evidence on the optimal cervical cancer control strategies. These models can be used to integrate the most up-to-date data, extrapolate current short- term findings into long-term outcomes, and evaluate what-if scenarios that would otherwise be impractical or infeasible to conduct in clinical studies. There has been a growing number of independent mathematical models that have been developed to address clinical and policy questions with respect to cervical cancer prevention and control but no formal efforts to compare assumptions and results across models. As part of the CISNET consortium, a group of established cervical cancer modelers from the U.S., Australia, and the Netherlands will engage in a formal collaboration of comparative modeling using a series of state-of-the-art mathematical models of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis. We will pursue analyses related to the historical impact of screening, the comparative effectiveness of current and anticipated HPV vaccination and screening strategies, and optimal routes for reducing cervical cancer disparities.

Currently, the\nmost critical bottleneck in the precision medicine workflow is at the interpretation step. However, there are few\nresources to help with the prioritization and interpretation of these alterations in a clinical context. Multiple\ngroups are building their own databases documenting clinical interpretation of tumor mutations as they are\nobserved in those groups. This represents a largely redundant effort with no mechanisms for capturing\nevolving evidence from the biomedical literature. Public knowledgebases are needed with sophisticated\napplication programming interfaces (APIs) that allow rapid intersection of genomic alterations with\ninterpretations of their clinical actionability. The goal of this proposal is to develop such an expert-curated\nknowledgebase, web interface and API for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC -\nwww.civicdb.org). The knowledge created from this effort will be freely available and the product of open\ndiscussion across a diverse community. This will require an interdisciplinary approach to combine the expertise\nof genome scientists and cancer researchers, whose efforts are otherwise often isolated. Content will be\ncreated with transparency, kept current, be comprehensive, track provenance, and acknowledge the efforts of\ncreators. It will cover all types of alterations from single nucleotide variants to structural variants, RNA fusions,\nexpression changes, epigenetic alterations and others. The interface will capture both structured statements of\nevidence for actionability to allow computational data mining and also human-readable interpretations. Content\nand software will be unencumbered and easy to access to encourage both academic and commercial\nengagement. In order to achieve these goals CIViC will require well-designed data standards, use of structured\nvocabularies, and a user-friendly curation interface that balances data mining needs with human accessibility.\nFocused `hackathons' and curation meetings will be organized to establish community standards and\ncoordinate with synergistic efforts by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and ClinGen\nworking groups.

This is particularly true for glioblastoma (GBM) where prognosis \nhas increased only by 2-3 months over the last 75 years with a 5-year survival of less than 4%. Many promising \npreclinical studies have failed to live up to expectations when tested clinically. This problem is likely due to: a) \nlimitations of the preclinical model system and b) lack of reliable biomarkers for proper patient selection. To \naddress these issues, investigators are increasingly utilizing patient-­derived models of cancer (PDMC) coupled \nwith comprehensive molecular profiling. However, differences in model composition, growth conditions, and \nother microenvironmental factors limit reliability of these models and hamper interpretation. We believe that a \ncareful investigation of tumor microenvironmental (TME) stressors on 3 patient­derived models (xenolines) of \nGBM, namely xenografts (PDX), spheroid cultures (neurospheres), and human biomatrix embedded 3D \nmicrotumors, will provide insight into critical aspects of tumor biology that are influenced by model and TME. \nThese models pre­ and post­ TME perturbagen will also be comprehensively profiled at the genomic, \ntranscriptomic, and kinomic (global kinase activity assessment through a peptide substrate microarray) level to \ngenerate a similarity distance metric. We hypothesize that application of TME stressors to the PDMC’s will \nimprove both molecular and biological fidelity of the respective models to that of the original tumor or parent \nxenoline that can be visualized and in silico tested using an advanced computational data modeling system \n(GeneTerrain). Our preliminary data generated from prior NIH funded projects indicate that our existing xenolines \nrecapitulate all four molecular subtypes of GBM identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas while reproducing the \nkey hallmarks of GBM when implanted orthotopically in immunocompromised mice. Importantly, we can grow \ndisaggregated xenoline tumors in a novel three-dimensional (3D) culture system incorporating many cells of the \ntumor microenvironment to produce 3D microtumors suitable for higher throughput drug testing. Moreover, we \nhave preliminary evidence that TME manipulation of BTICs or 3D microtumors (e.g., hypoxia or nutrient \ndeprivation) promotes a more aggressive tumor phenotype in vitro and in vivo that is accompanied by changes \nin kinomic signatures. Therefore, we will: 1) Generate 3 PDMC models from existing xenolines as well as de \nnovo GBM patient tumors with comprehensive omic testing to calculate similarity distance metrics among the \nmodels with corresponding biological assessments including growth, chemoradiation sensitivity, and stemness \nmarkers;; 2) Perform TME perturbagen testing of the derivative PDMCs (neurospheres and 3D microtumors) and \ndetermine impact on tumor biology and similarity distance metric;; 3) Develop and validate GeneTerrain models \nof the various PDMCs with respect to TME and therapeutic sensitivity (radiation and temozolomide).	3-Dimensional;Address;Behavior;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Models;Biology;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Cancer Biology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Fraction;Cell Line;Cell Proliferation;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Communities;Complex;Computer Simulation;Consensus;Coupled;Data;Data Science;Dimensions;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Elements;Environment;Exhibits;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Failure;Funding;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Glucose;Goals;Gold;Grant;Growth;Growth Factor;Human;Hypoxia;Immunocompromised Host;Implant;In Vitro;Investigation;Knowledge;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurable;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mus;Nutrient;Oxygen;Parents;Patient Selection;Patients;Peptides;Performance;Phenotype;Phosphotransferases;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Predictive Cancer Model;Property;Radiation;Radiation Tolerance;Radiation therapy;Reproducibility;Research Personnel;Sampling;Serum;Signal Transduction;Standard Model;Stress;System;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Therapeutic;Tumor Biology;Tumor Initiators;United States National Institutes of Health;Xenograft procedure;anticancer research;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cell immortalization;chemoradiation;clinical practice;cost;data modeling;drug development;drug discovery;drug testing;established cell line;expectation;experience;human disease;human model;immortalized cell;improved;in vivo;insight;molecular subtypes;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;novel;nutrient deprivation;outcome forecast;patient response;pre-clinical;preclinical study;pressure;standard of care;stem;stem-like cell;stemness;stressor;temozolomide;therapy resistant;three dimensional cell culture;tool;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor xenograft;vector	UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM	BIRMINGHAM	AL	UNITED STATES	Jake Yue Chen,Xiangqin  Cui,G.

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in\nestablishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication\nbetween cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and\ntumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize\nmacrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific\nmetabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making\nArginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer\ncells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of\nmatched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of\ncancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie “microtumors”) and a unique dual recombinase\ngenetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with\ninhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition,\novercoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer\nmicroenvironment.

Despite\nsuccess in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC\ndemonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly\nunderstood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an\nimproved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will\nenable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future\nimmunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in\nPDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that\ntarget tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this\nproject, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic\nPDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will\nutilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at\nunprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy,\nradiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these\nstudies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional\nevaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3\nwe will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to\ninvestigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and\nimprove immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in\nPDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME\nand identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating\ndisease.

project	5U01CA224151-03	U01CA224151	10267779	2021	Canine Immuno Neurotherapeutics	Grant	ABSTRACT:\nThe dog is an ideal large animal model for diagnostic and therapeutic studies and can be used to translate\nsuccesses to human patients while providing compassionate care to animals and advancing the field of\nveterinary medicine. Pet dogs share their environment, and oftentimes their diet, with their owners. Dogs and\nhumans develop sporadic benign and malignant brain tumors at about the same rate and with similar\nhistopathology. Dogs are often euthanized due to the cost of care. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine\nbrain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people as well as pets through comparative\noncology and genomics and the “One Medicine” approach to research and direct clinical application. We propose\na multi-institutional consortium to test an innovative combinatorial immunotherapeutic approach in dogs that\nspontaneously and sporadically develop malignant glial brain tumors that resemble in most important aspects,\nhigh-grade malignant gliomas in humans. Our approach will inject a clinical grade oncolytic herpes simplex virus\n(HSV) M032 that expresses human interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the resected tumor bed. Dog lymphocytes fully\nrespond to human IL-12 [1] and oncolytic HSV infect and kill canine (as well as mouse, non-human primate,\nhuman) tumor cells, creating a potent local inflammatory response and an antigen-rich tumor cell debris field.\nTherefore, we would anticipate that this virally-based immunotherapeutic approach would likely be as effective\nin dogs with brain tumors as in humans with brain tumors. We will conduct longitudinal safety, survival and\ncorrelative biology evaluations as a means of assessing the dog as an appropriate and informative model for\ndesign and implementation of clinical studies in humans with high-grade malignant brain tumors. To extend these\nfindings, we propose, in subsequent studies, to combine the HSV immunotherapy approach with molecules that\nblock the action of innate checkpoint inhibitor(s). These studies are designed to address key issues of safety\nand efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy in the dog that can be translated to humans with malignant gliomas.\nMalignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in humans, accounting for 30% of all primary\ncentral nervous system (CNS) tumors in adults. [2] With few major advances in decades, there has been no\nsignificant reduction in mortality and only a modest improvement in median survival. Recently, objective\nresponses and long-term survivals have been observed in human glioma patients who have received oncolytic\nvirotherapy and a Phase I trial is currently underway at UAB in patients using M032 alone. New approaches to\nutilize checkpoint inhibitors promises improved efficacy, but the ability to develop more effective combinatorial\napproaches has been slow, in large part due to lack of a faithful model of spontaneous glioblastoma multiforme\n(GBM) in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal\nopportunity to improve the lives of people and pets through comparative oncology and genomics using the “One\nMedicine“ approach to research and direct clinical application.

Despite this progress, up to 40% of patients will ultimately succumb to their\ndisease. Furthermore, even when treatment is successful, cytotoxic chemotherapy carries a high risk of long-\nterm morbidities that impact quality of life. The recent success of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint\ninhibitors in the setting of lymphoma demonstrates the potential for additional progress in long-term disease\ncontrol of DLBCL, with less toxicity. The molecular and genetic phenotype of canine DLBCL has been studied\nand it often resembles the activated B cell (ABC) category typically associated with aggressive DLBCL in people.\nMoreover, there is now substantial data that specific genetic changes and pathway aberrations are conserved\nacross dogs and people with DLBCL supporting the notion that the canine disease can be used as a relevant\nspontaneous large animal model of the human counterpart. Toward this end, the purpose of this proposal is to\nuse dogs with spontaneous naïve DLBCL to rapidly evaluate rational small molecule/immunotherapy\ncombination approaches, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most effective combination to move forward in\nhuman patients with DLBCL. Specifically, we hypothesize that optimal combinations of anti-CD20, anti-\nPD1, XPO1 inhibition, NAMPT/PAK4 and PI3Kdelta inhibition will have better outcomes than doxorubicin\nbased chemotherapy, resulting in a “chemo-free” blueprint for future human trials. Using an adaptive\nmini-pilot trial approach, those combinations deemed antagonistic and/or associated with unacceptable adverse\nevents can be rapidly removed from consideration, while those with clear therapeutic promise can be most\neffectively studied in the front-line setting and enhanced. We will accomplish this by first determining the optimal\nchemo-free regimen with small molecule/ anti-CD20 combinations, then identifying the optimal chemo-free\nregimen with small molecule/anti-PD1 combinations and finally, by evaluating a frontline chemo-free novel\ncombination regimen in canine DLBCL to demonstrate superiority to standard R-CHOP-based chemotherapy.\nAdditionally, we will interrogate correlative biomarkers based on RNA sequencing of tumor samples obtained\nfrom dogs enrolled into the prospective trials and develop signatures that can be used to predict not only\nresponse to therapy, but more importantly long-term progression-free survival. Together, the data generated\nfrom this proposal will create a framework for effectively leveraging information gained from integrated\nimmunotherapeutic trials in canine patients with DLBCL to develop chemo-free strategies that ultimately improve\nhuman outcomes.

In the field of immunotherapy, dogs offer an innovative model for translational research, as they\npresent many of the challenges faced in “scaling up” therapeutic systems dependent on complex interactions\nbetween multiple cell types yet under more controlled settings. They also allow for long-term assessment of\nefficacy and toxicities. Canine clinical trials offer unique access to a rich source of spontaneously occurring,\ngenetically and immunologically diverse cancers with the benefits of reduced time, expense, and regulatory\nhurdles of a human trial. The similarities between canine and human cancers are increasingly being realized.\nThe publicly available canine genome has propelled comparative genomics studies that have shown significant\nhomology between dogs and humans for recognized cancer-associated genes including MET, IGF1R, mTOR,\nand KIT. Not surprisingly, cytogenetic abnormalities that define human cancers, i.e. BCR-Abl translocations in\nchronic myelogenous leukemia and RB1 deletions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been found in\ncomparable canine cancers. Intracranial neoplasia occurs frequently in dogs with a reported prevalence from\n0.15 to 4.5% compared to 18.2 cases per 100,000 human. Astrocytoma or glioma account for 20-36% of\nprimary brain tumors in dogs and 25% in humans. Brachycephalic breeds such as Boxers, French and English\nbulldogs, and Boston terriers have a significantly increased risk of developing gliomas. Primary canine brain\ntumors have similar histologic classification as those reported by the World Health Organization for human\nbrain tumors. Similar to that in humans, the prognosis for dogs with brain tumors in general is poor regardless\nof therapeutic intervention. However, much less is known about canine glioma treatment outcomes because\nonly a small number of studies with few dogs have been reported. There is little information about median\nsurvival time for dogs with glioma that received any type of treatment, but estimates of days to 2 or 3 months\nare often given to owners. The clinical similarities between dogs and humans suggest that dogs may represent\nan outstanding model for testing targeted therapies; both dogs and humans might benefit from these studies.\nHerein, we are proposing a multi-pronged immunotherapeutic approach to improve efficacy and survival times.\nWe hypothesize that combination immunotherapy in a canine glioma model will enhance efficacy and\naccelerate successful translation into phase I human trials for GBM. The objective is to use pet dogs with\nspontaneous GBM to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of combination immunotherapy. We propose two\nSpecific Aims: 1. Determine the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in spontaneous\ncanine GBM in combination with standard of care, and 2. Assess the efficacy of immune-mediated gene\ntherapy in combination with CD200 blockade to enhance anti-glioma immunotherapy.

This work is targeted to dogs with typically lethal, naturally occurring osteosarcoma (OSA)\nand melanoma, and the findings are expected to have important relevance for the design and translation of\ninnovative immunotherapy approaches in humans. Inhaled (IH) IL-15 offers the advantages of local delivery of\nthis immune-stimulatory cytokine, while limiting systemic exposure and thus potential toxicity. Super-agonist IL-\n15 offers increased half-life and greater anti-tumor effects. Therefore, each of these cytokines is anticipated to\nalter the risk/benefit ratio in favor of their use. To accomplish these objectives, we propose the following three\nspecific aims: 1) Targeting gross pulmonary metastases (OSA and melanoma) with first-in-dog delivery of\ninhaled (IH) human IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15; 2) Phase II trial of IH IL-15 and autologous NK cells to treat\ngross OSA and melanoma pulmonary metastases, and; 3) Targeting micro-metastatic disease using super-\nagonist IL-15 in primary OSA. The canine model represents a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy research\nas an important link between murine models and human clinical studies. Dogs represent an attractive outbred\ncombination of companion animals that experience spontaneous cancer development in the setting of an intact\nimmune system. Importantly, these studies are designed to evaluate novel treatment combinations for\nadvanced pulmonary metastases in the setting of gross disease, but also will determine the impact of this\napproach as first-line therapy when combined with standard-of-care treatments. Moreover, this work seeks to\nelucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate an anti-tumor response (or non-response) in\ndogs with naturally occurring cancers. We will have the unique opportunity to perform whole exome\nsequencing and RNASeq on tumor tissue pre- and post-immunotherapy, and we will investigate whether a\nsignature of mutational landscape and gene expression profiles can be developed to prospectively predict\noutcome and response to immune therapies. We will correlate these data to immunohistochemical, flow\ncytometry, and serum cytokine readouts for evidence of transition from “cold” to “hot” tumors predictive of\nfavorable long term outcome. Hence, these canine trials and bio-marker studies represent an ideal strategy to\ninform and facilitate the rapid translation of novel, potentially high impact immune therapies to human patients\nwith aggressive cancers.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic\nresponse, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to\npresumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking.\n3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme\noutcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular\nimmunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term\nsurvivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and\nthat long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this\nproposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment-\nspecific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can\nneoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue\nand blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy.\nThe proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies – a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to\nidentify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific\nmodulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic\nPDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating\nexosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation\nsequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen\ndiscovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of\nneoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of\nhighly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill\nCornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute\nfor Advanced Study. This initiative is directly relevant to the primary objective to develop novel biomarkers and\nT cell antigenic targets for the successful application of immunotherapy in PDAC.

project	5U01CA224182-03	U01CA224182	10260606	2021	Optimizing Novel Immunotherapy Combinations Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment in Canine Spontaneous Osteosarcoma	Grant	Project Abstract\nSpontaneous canine osteosarcoma (OS) is a well-defined large animal model of human OS, exhibiting similar\nclinical presentation and molecular aberrations. Indeed, canine OS has historically been used to help develop\nnovel limb spare techniques, evaluate a variety of non-specific immunotherapeutics such as L-MTP-PE, and\nassess the efficacy of targeted therapeutics to prevent the outgrowth of metastatic disease. Despite best efforts,\nprogress in the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease has essentially stalled for the past 3 decades;\n30% of people and 90% of dogs still die of tumor spread, primarily to the lungs. Numerous clinical trials have\nbeen undertaken in people with macroscopic metastases and in dogs with both microscopic and macroscopic\ndisease, yet all have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes. This is particularly evident with respect to\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors that do not induce the dramatic disease regressions typically observed in other\ncancers such as melanoma and lung cancer. One particularly daunting challenge for immunotherapy-based\ntherapeutics in OS relates to the permissiveness of the tumor microenvironment (TME) for inducing anti-tumor\nimmune responses. Our data suggests that a relatively low mutational load combined with a dampened overall\nimmune response in OS may contribute to the observed lack of response to current treatment approaches. We\npropose that targeting the immune suppressive TME in OS is essential to generating potent and durable anti-\ntumor immunity. To accomplish this, it may be necessary to simultaneously modulate several elements in the\nTME, including Tregs, MDSCs, M2 macrophages and overexpressed inhibitory checkpoint molecules. In support\nof this, we have generated a body of data demonstrating immunological activity of multiple therapeutics, including\nrepurposed drugs with good safety records (losartan, oclacitinib), small molecule inhibitors with established\nPK/PD in dogs (toceranib, RV1001, reparixin, JHU-292) and antibodies specific for checkpoint molecules (anti-\nPD1). However, the exact combinations that are most effective against metastatic OS have not yet been\nidentified, and this is a major goal of this proposal. As such, we hypothesize that an adaptive pilot trial design\ncan be used to rapidly screen TME-targeting immunotherapy drug combinations in dogs with\nmacroscopic chemotherapy-resistant metastatic OS and that this information can be refined to assess\nactivity of the most active approach against microscopic metastases in a subsequent adjuvant trial. This\nwill be accomplished by testing four TME modifying immunotherapy combinations for anti-tumor and immune\nmodulatory activity in dogs with macroscopic OS metastases, interrogating relevant biomarkers associated with\nresponses to therapy, then using this information to conduct an adjuvant immunotherapy trial with the most active\ncombination in dogs with microscopic metastatic OS. The data generated from this proposal will create a\nblueprint for future immunotherapy studies in people with OS by eliminating approaches deemed inactive\nand generating a set of clinical biomarkers to guide treatment.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this\ncomplex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the\nprohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water,\ndense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and\npro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this\nproject has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several\nhighly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and\ninteractions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote\nthe survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that\nsignificantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also\nthe three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In\nthe following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and\nmyeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will\npursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and\nmitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic\nallografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).

project	5U01CA224348-03	U01CA224348	10251378	2021	Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy	Grant	We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n(PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan,\ncan enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS\n2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include “normalization” of cancer-associated\nfibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and\ndecreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at\nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy – FOLFIRINOX and\nthen chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this\ntrial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to\nresectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably,\ntranscriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only\nnormalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity\ninvolving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the\nPDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in\ncombination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive\nPDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs\nand cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had\nlimited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover\nhow losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood\nvessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug-\ninduced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically\nengineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment\nreprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on\nour preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our\nbench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will\npositively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have\na 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the\nknowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment\nin PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium. Through this work, we will develop innovative\napproaches to enhance anti-tumor immunity in this intractable disease.

Nonclassical\nmonocytes function in circulation to aid in removing pathogens and debris from the vasculature. We recently\nfound that nonclassical monocytes function in the vasculature to prevent tumor metastasis by orchestrating\nthe killing and clearance of metastasizing tumor cells. The anti-tumor immune potential of nonclassical\npatrolling monocytes is in contrast to the growing evidence for pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic functions\nof myeloid cells in many tumor types. In the current proposal, we hypothesize that nonclassical monocytes\nfunction in an anti-tumoral manner to support CAR T cell expansion and efficacy in patients with solid\ntumors. Thus, one major goal of our proposal is to determine whether monocyte therapy using anti-tumoral\nnonclassical monocytes in combination with existing CAR T immunotherapy would improve efficacy. We will\nuse mass cytometry to study monocyte subsets in cancer patients to identify new markers that will help\nreadily determine how successful a proposed immunotherapy may be for patients. Aim 1 will identify unique\nmarkers of nonclassical monocytes in multiply relapsed sarcoma patients versus healthy subjects using\nmass cytometry. Aim 1 will be performed using banked samples from the existing GD2 CAR T trial at the\nNIH Clinical Center. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that nonclassical monocytes play a functional role in\npromoting anti-tumor immunity when used in combination with immunotherapy for solid tumor metastasis.\nAim 2 will use both xenografted humanized mouse and syngeneic mouse tumor models. Aim 3 will study\nthe safety and preliminary efficacy of CAR T cell immunotherapy in combination with nonclassical monocyte\ncell therapy for patients with multiple relapsed, metastatic or progressive pediatric solid tumors. In Aim 3, we\nwill initiate a second generation GD2 CAR T cell trial for multiply relapsed patients with osteosarcoma and\nneuroblastoma. Given the potential anti-tumor efficacy of patrolling monocytes we plan to initiate an early\nphase clinical trial delivering nonclassical monocytes alone and in combination with CAR T cell therapy as\npart of this trial. There are 3 investigators in this project: one extramural, one intramural at NCI, and one at\nthe NIH Clinical Center. From the results of this proposal, we will achieve significant insight into the roles of\nvarious myeloid cell subpopulations on promoting and inhibiting the anti-tumoral responses of CAR T cell\ntherapies for solid tumors. We are uniquely poised as a research team to directly address the role of\nmonocytes and other myeloid cells in interacting with CAR T cells in human patients. The findings of our\nresearch team will significantly advance the knowledge that will lead to effective CAR T cell therapy for solid\ntumors.

There is, however, a considerable gap in\nunderstanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiotherapy resistance in SCLC. Our project is\nunique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on\nchemoradioresistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient-\nderived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate mechanisms of therapy\nresistance. This approach was remarkably successful, identifying a tolerable and strongly synergistic anti-\nSCLC interaction that led to a CTEP-approved trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070; Study Chair:\nHann). In this research program, we will test key hypotheses via three specific aims that will provide more\nmechanistic insights into the rapidly emergent chemoradiation resistance observed in LS SCLC.\nOne central hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive gene expression changes mediate rapid emergence of\nthe chemoradiation resistance phenotype in LS SCLC. We have developed a novel chemoradiation treatment\nregimen with SCLC PDX models to facilitate these studies. Development and characterization of this novel\nmodel involves a unique collaboration between medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, bioinformaticians,\nmedical physicists, veterinarians and molecular/cell biologists that is extremely well suited to develop an\nintegrated program dedicated to resolving questions of SCLC chemoradioresistance. Finally, we have already\nidentified novel gene targets that are correlated with SCLC chemoradioresistance.\nOur research program is organized as follows: Aim #1: Characterize natural history of response of\nexperimental models of SCLC to chemoradiation in vivo. We will determine response rates and recurrence\npatterns of a panel of SCLC PDXs and transgenic mouse models. Aim #2: Characterization of molecular\nunderpinnings of SCLC chemoradiation resistance. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks and gene\nexpression profiles associated with chemoradiation resistance and develop small-scale predictive classifiers for\ntherapy response to be validated in follow-up studies. Aim #3: Pharmacologic and genetic validation of\ncandidate genes for SCLC chemoradiation resistance in vitro and in vivo. We will validate our novel gene\ncandidates for conferring chemoradiation resistance using pharmacologic and genetic approach with SCLC\nPDX-derived organoids and SCLC transgenic mouse models.

TFH cells are crucial for the formation of germinal centers and\nhumoral responses, and our new data show that TFH cells become the main producers of\nCXCL13 and TNFS14/LIGHT upon vaccination. The assembly and maintenance of TLS should\nbe therefore dependent on TFH responses. Our new data demonstrate that Special AT-rich\nsequence-binding protein-1 (Satb1) ablation specifically in T cells leads to enhanced TFH\ndifferentiation and augmented Ag-specific humoral responses, which is associated with\nconcurrent ICOS and PD-1 de-repression. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that\nLIGHT+CXCL13+ TFH cell formation and, subsequently, the orchestration of TLS in cancer, is\ngoverned by Satb1 silencing in CD4 T cells by both de-repressing ICOS in TFH cells and\nsuppressing Foxp3+PD-1highCXCR5+ T follicular regulatory (TFR) cell formation through PD-1\nup-regulation. Therefore, TGF-β paradoxically enhances the generation of TFH cells and the\nformation of TLS through Satb1 repression.\n In Aim 1, we will define the role of SATB1-dependent ICOS expression during TFH\ndifferentiation. Through ChIP-PCR and functional analysis of Satb1-competent vs. Satb1-\ndeficient T cells in vivo, we will substantiate a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby the master\ngenomic organizer Satb1 governs ICOS expression, leading to enhanced TFH differentiation in\nthe absence of Satb1.\n In Aim 2, we will determine the role of SATB1 in TGF-β-driven, Treg-dependent TFH\ndifferentiation. Here, we will combine geentic manipulation and existing transgenic models to\nestablish to what extent the mechanism of TGF-β-driven TFH differentiation is Satb1- and PD-1-\ndependent, in a manner that requires decreased TFR formation.\n In Aim 3, we will recapitulate the mechanisms leading to the formation and protective activity\nof TLS in vivo in ovarian cancer. By leveraging unique transgenic models, our ovarian cancer-\nspecific CAR T cells and our viable single-cell suspensions from freshly dissociated ovarian\ncarcinomas, we will define a novel TGF-β → Satb1 silencing → TFH cell formation axis driving\nrelevant anti-tumor humoral responses.\n Our work will exert a profound effect in the field by elucidating how epigenetic programs\ncontrolled by SATB1 govern the generation of TFH cells at tumor beds in a TGF-β-dependent\nmanner. Recapitulating these mechanisms in vivo will pave the way for more effective\nimmunotherapies aimed to promote combined humoral and T cell responses through the\norchestration of TLS in irresectable/metastatic tumors, and could lead to the identification of\nantibodies with anti-tumor activity spontaneously produced at tumor beds.

Strategies to assess the genetic risk of unaffected individuals are needed. Scalable and\nsustainable methods to automatically extract and analyze family history information routinely captured in the\nelectronic health record (EHR) can identify primary care patients appropriate for cancer genetic services.\nIncreased patient ascertainment needs to be paired with implementation studies to compare models of\ndelivering genetic services, including patient-directed models. Because access to services continues to be a\nbarrier for those from minority racial and ethnic groups and rural areas, examining responses to different\ndelivery models across population subgroups is essential. This study will employ an implementation science\nframework to test a replicable EHR-based clinical decision support (CDS) infrastructure to: (i) automatically\nidentify unaffected patients from 48 primary care clinics in two healthcare systems, University of Utah and New\nYork University, who qualify for cancer genetic services (Aim 1); and (ii) compare two models of genetic\nservices delivery for 1,920 primary care patients using a randomized trial design with clinic-level randomization\n(Aims 2 and 3). We hypothesize that the CDS infrastructure will identify additional patients who have not been\npreviously referred (Aim 1) and that uptake of genetic testing (Aim 2) and adherence to management\nrecommendations (Aim 3) will be equivalent between the models. To address Aim 1, we will evaluate whether\nthe CDS approach identifies patients who have not previously been referred, and whether this varies by\nrace/ethnicity and rurality. To address Aim 2, we will compare: a patient-directed model in which those\nidentified by the CDS infrastructure as meeting testing criteria will be informed of their cancer risks, provided\nwith educational resources, and offered the option to select genetic testing through a patient portal to an\nenhanced standard of care model in which providers and patients are notified through CDS when criteria are\nmet and of the availability of standard of care genetic counseling. We will compare uptake of genetic testing by\nmodel and whether this differs by race/ethnicity and rurality. In Aim 3, we will compare the effects of the two\ndelivery models on adherence to recommendations 12 months after return of results, examining differences in\neffects by race/ethnicity and rurality. Innovative features include implementation of population-based CDS\nassessment of family history information available in the EHR; comparison of outcomes of patient-directed and\nenhanced standard of care delivery models; and focus on impact of race/ethnicity and rurality.

Strategies to assess the genetic risk of unaffected individuals are needed. Scalable and\nsustainable methods to automatically extract and analyze family history information routinely captured in the\nelectronic health record (EHR) can identify primary care patients appropriate for cancer genetic services.\nIncreased patient ascertainment needs to be paired with implementation studies to compare models of\ndelivering genetic services, including patient-directed models. Because access to services continues to be a\nbarrier for those from minority racial and ethnic groups and rural areas, examining responses to different\ndelivery models across population subgroups is essential. This study will employ an implementation science\nframework to test a replicable EHR-based clinical decision support (CDS) infrastructure to: (i) automatically\nidentify unaffected patients from 48 primary care clinics in two healthcare systems, University of Utah and New\nYork University, who qualify for cancer genetic services (Aim 1); and (ii) compare two models of genetic\nservices delivery for 1,920 primary care patients using a randomized trial design with clinic-level randomization\n(Aims 2 and 3). We hypothesize that the CDS infrastructure will identify additional patients who have not been\npreviously referred (Aim 1) and that uptake of genetic testing (Aim 2) and adherence to management\nrecommendations (Aim 3) will be equivalent between the models. To address Aim 1, we will evaluate whether\nthe CDS approach identifies patients who have not previously been referred, and whether this varies by\nrace/ethnicity and rurality. To address Aim 2, we will compare: a patient-directed model in which those\nidentified by the CDS infrastructure as meeting testing criteria will be informed of their cancer risks, provided\nwith educational resources, and offered the option to select genetic testing through a patient portal to an\nenhanced standard of care model in which providers and patients are notified through CDS when criteria are\nmet and of the availability of standard of care genetic counseling. We will compare uptake of genetic testing by\nmodel and whether this differs by race/ethnicity and rurality. In Aim 3, we will compare the effects of the two\ndelivery models on adherence to recommendations 12 months after return of results, examining differences in\neffects by race/ethnicity and rurality. Innovative features include implementation of population-based CDS\nassessment of family history information available in the EHR; comparison of outcomes of patient-directed and\nenhanced standard of care delivery models; and focus on impact of race/ethnicity and rurality.

Germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, primarily MLH1 and MSH2,\ncause deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) and LS. LS CRCs have exceptionally high numbers of small\ninsertion/deletion frameshift and missense mutations. Elevated dMMR mutation rates cause some mutations to\nrecurrently arise in tumors from different patients. For example, the human TGFβR2 gene has a poly(A) coding\nrepeat, and the same “shared” frameshift mutation is recurrently identified in >60% of LS dMMR CRCs. Here,\nwe will use state of the art tools to systematically delineate recurrent LS mouse and human pre-malignant\nneoantigens, test whether vaccination with frequently mutated “shared” immunogenic neoantigens reduces LS\nmouse CRC penetrance, and elucidate adaptive immune mechanisms for CRC immunoprevention. In Aim 1\nwe will comprehensively delineate frequently mutated recurrent neoantigens in Lynch syndrome mouse\ncolorectal mucosa and adenomas. This will provide insights into pre-malignant colon dMMR immunoediting\nmechanisms, the timing and sequence of dMMR neoantigen appearance, and systematically delineate the\nmost immunogenic recurrent shared dMMR neoantigen vaccine targets for LS mouse CRC immunoprevention.\nIn Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome\nmismatch repair deficient epithelial cells in colon mucosa. This will give insights into the mechanism of dMMR\ncolon mucosal immunoediting, and test the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent neoantigen vaccine\nstrategy using the earliest neoantigen mutations for LS immunoprevention. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis\nthat recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome colorectal tumor burden. This will\nevaluate the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent adenoma neoantigen vaccine strategy for Lynch\nsyndrome immunoprevention and provide insights into the mechanisms of dMMR immunoediting. Finally, in\nAim 4 we will systematically delineate Lynch syndrome patient adenoma recurrent neoantigens.

This will give insights into the mechanism of dMMR\ncolon mucosal immunoediting, and test the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent neoantigen vaccine\nstrategy using the earliest neoantigen mutations for LS immunoprevention. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis\nthat recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome colorectal tumor burden. This will\nevaluate the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent adenoma neoantigen vaccine strategy for Lynch\nsyndrome immunoprevention and provide insights into the mechanisms of dMMR immunoediting. Finally, in\nAim 4 we will systematically delineate Lynch syndrome patient adenoma recurrent neoantigens. This will\ndelineate the most promising candidate recurrent neoantigens that can be used for LS patient tumor vaccine\nclinical trials and give insights into dMMR immunoediting mechanisms. Our overall goal is to develop effective,\nsafe mechanism based neoantigen vaccination strategies for Lynch syndrome CRC immunoprevention.

Small cell carcinomas arise from many different epithelial tissues but are generally\naggressive, have no curative treatment, and carry a dire prognosis. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most\ncommon subtype. Small cell prostate cancer (SCPC) is rare as a primary disease but is becoming increasingly\ncommon as a late-stage phenotypic transition in response to hormone-deprivation therapy. Emerging research\nindicates that despite their disparate tissues of origin, SCPC and SCLC are highly similar in behavior and\nmolecular phenotype. This suggests effective targeted therapies could address both malignancies.\n Our strategy is to define cancer-specific epitopes created by alternative pre-mRNA splicing in small cell\ncarcinomas and then use these targets to develop TCR-based therapeutics. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell\n(CAR-T) therapies targeting cell surface proteins have been developed for some hematological malignancies,\nbut this strategy has been unsuccessful for epithelial tumors. The limited cancer specificity of the target epitope\nhas led to significant on-target, off-tumor toxicities in human trials. We have chosen to pursue TCRs to expand\nthe pool of available targets beyond the cell surface. We hypothesize that tapping into the additional proteomic\ndiversity revealed by a detailed analysis of alternatively spliced exons will provide better targets.\n Our team of principal investigators includes experts in the computational biology of alternative splicing\n(Yi Xing), cancer cell biology and immunology (Owen Witte), and hematopoietic cell development and\nimmunology (Gay Crooks). We are compiling RNA-Seq data on small cell cancers and normal tissues from\npublic datasets and new human cell line models of SCPC & SCLC derived from benign cells by lentiviral\ntransduction. This combined dataset serves as the foundation for our discovery effort. We plan to pair this with\ntotal proteomics analysis to identify spliced isoforms that affect protein composition. This data will be further\nintegrated with immunopeptidomics assays that define the pool of peptides presented to the immune system\nby the target cancer cells. Epitopes derived from alternative splicing events that show high cancer specificity,\nprotein expression, and predicted or observed epitope presentation will be prioritized for TCR development.\nWe will use these epitopes to select TCRs from naïve human T-cell populations using a highly organotypic in\nvitro artificial human thymic culture system developed in the Crooks laboratory.

All three\napproaches induce T cell mediated killing of cancer cells. However, widespread development of bi-specific\nantibodies and CAR T cells is limited by the small number of known cell-surface proteins that are sufficiently\nspecific to cancer to safely allow targeting by antibodies. This is particularly true for solid cancers, where unlike\nhematopoietic malignancies, loss of healthy cells cannot be readily replenished by stem cell progenitors. A\nsolution to this issue is to target cancer specific glycan antigens rather than protein antigens. Indeed, altered\nglycosylation is a near universal feature of cancer and represent the most abundant and widely expressed cell\nsurface cancer antigens, while also having limited or no expression in normal tissue. However, generation of\nmonoclonal antibodies specific to complex carbohydrates has proven to be very challenging, greatly limiting\ntheir usefulness as targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we propose to address these issues and\ndevelop a novel class of immunotherapeutics that target an N-linked carbohydrate antigen common to\nthe vast majority of solid and hematopoietic cancers. We have termed these molecules as Glycan-\ndependent T cell Recruiter (GlyTR) technology. Critically, GlyTR technology does not utilize antibodies to\ntarget carbohydrate cancer antigens. Preliminary data demonstrates that the GlyTR bi-specific protein 1)\nspecifically bound to both human CD3 and its N-glycan target, 2) robustly activated T cells only in the presence\nof cancer cells, 3) induced T cell dependent killing of cancer cells with an EC50 as low as 5pM, 4) inhibited in\nvivo growth of established colon cancer xenografts in humanized NSG mice and 5) did not trigger production of\nantibodies in mice. To further expand on this approach, the following Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will\ncharacterize human and mouse reactive GlyTR bi-specific proteins targeting N-glycans.

However, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been limited by low response rates and limited durations\nof response in certain settings, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer\n(TNBC), as well as ovarian, prostate and colorectal cancers. These findings are explained, at least in part, by\nthe premise that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is only one of a number of tumor immune suppressive mechanisms that\nrequire inhibition.\n Therefore, additional strategies are clearly needed to improve the immunotherapy of human cancers. In\nthis respect, cancer cells activate a program of immune evasion involving, for example, induction of PD-L1\nexpression and the downregulation of effectors that promote innate and adaptive immune response. The\ndiscovery and targeting of such immune suppressive programs has had limited success to date, supporting a\ncritical need for identifying signaling pathways that activate these programs.\n The MUC1-C oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in human carcinomas and is associated with poor\nclinical outcomes. MUC1-C promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the cancer stem cell\n(CSC) state. Recent advances have demonstrated that MUC1-C also activates a program of immune evasion\nin human cancer cells that includes upregulation of PD-L1 expression and the suppression of immune\neffectors, such as IFN.

Advances in immunotherapy with drugs\ntargeting immune checkpoints have raised hopes that these agents will improve outcomes for mCRPC\npatients. While initial studies of immune checkpoint blockade have been unsuccessful, emerging evidence\nsuggests a subset of prostate cancer (PCa) patients can respond, although the mechanisms of PCa\nimmunotherapy response and resistance are incompletely characterized. Work in other immunotherapy\nresponsive malignancies has found several predictive immune and tumor-intrinsic properties that contribute to\nresponse, but the extent to which these (or other) features are operant in PCa is largely unknown. For\nexample, we recently identified mutations in a chromatin remodeling complex that mediates immunotherapy\nresponse through T cell interactions in solid tumors, and in parallel discovered a previously unknown PCa\ngenomic subclass defined by mutations in these same chromatin remodelers. These findings indicate that\ntumor-intrinsic epigenetic dysregulation may also interact with the immune system to modulate PCa\nimmunotherapy responsiveness. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that multiple immune and tumor-\nintrinsic properties mediate PCa interactions with the immune system, and these interactions can be modified\nthrough selective targeting in combination with checkpoint blockade to expand the therapeutic potential of\nimmunotherapy in PCa. We will leverage our team's deep experience in clinically grounded molecular\ncharacterization and preclinical models that can test immunotherapy combinations in PCa to define the\nprocesses that govern the immunotherapy landscape in PCa. The proposed specific aims are: 1) Define the\nsystemic and infiltrating immune states in PCa associated with clinical response to checkpoint blockade; 2)\nEstablish the immunologic impact of chromatin dysregulation and inhibition in PCa; and 3) Determine the\nimpact of existing DNA damaging agents for sensitizing PCa to PD-1 blockade. This proposal leverages the\nextensive, novel, and complementary resources at both Dana-Farber/Broad Institute and University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, led by highly collaborative investigators and an international scientific team, to\naddress the hypotheses outlined herein. Through a combination of functional, molecular, and clinical\napproaches inherent in these studies, our team is poised to identify mCRPC cohorts that may benefit from this\ntreatment paradigm, determine strategies to augment the use of checkpoint inhibitors in this disease, and\nmechanistically define the immune and tumor-intrinsic defects that drive immunoresistance in PCa. Broadly,\nthis project will provide a unique approach for the Immuno-Oncology Translation Network (IOTN) community\nand enable discovery of anti-cancer immunotherapies strategies for PCa that may have larger relevance\nacross the IOTN network and collaborating members of the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.

Advances in immunotherapy with drugs\ntargeting immune checkpoints have raised hopes that these agents will improve outcomes for mCRPC\npatients. While initial studies of immune checkpoint blockade have been unsuccessful, emerging evidence\nsuggests a subset of prostate cancer (PCa) patients can respond, although the mechanisms of PCa\nimmunotherapy response and resistance are incompletely characterized. Work in other immunotherapy\nresponsive malignancies has found several predictive immune and tumor-intrinsic properties that contribute to\nresponse, but the extent to which these (or other) features are operant in PCa is largely unknown. For\nexample, we recently identified mutations in a chromatin remodeling complex that mediates immunotherapy\nresponse through T cell interactions in solid tumors, and in parallel discovered a previously unknown PCa\ngenomic subclass defined by mutations in these same chromatin remodelers. These findings indicate that\ntumor-intrinsic epigenetic dysregulation may also interact with the immune system to modulate PCa\nimmunotherapy responsiveness. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that multiple immune and tumor-\nintrinsic properties mediate PCa interactions with the immune system, and these interactions can be modified\nthrough selective targeting in combination with checkpoint blockade to expand the therapeutic potential of\nimmunotherapy in PCa. We will leverage our team's deep experience in clinically grounded molecular\ncharacterization and preclinical models that can test immunotherapy combinations in PCa to define the\nprocesses that govern the immunotherapy landscape in PCa. The proposed specific aims are: 1) Define the\nsystemic and infiltrating immune states in PCa associated with clinical response to checkpoint blockade; 2)\nEstablish the immunologic impact of chromatin dysregulation and inhibition in PCa; and 3) Determine the\nimpact of existing DNA damaging agents for sensitizing PCa to PD-1 blockade. This proposal leverages the\nextensive, novel, and complementary resources at both Dana-Farber/Broad Institute and University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, led by highly collaborative investigators and an international scientific team, to\naddress the hypotheses outlined herein. Through a combination of functional, molecular, and clinical\napproaches inherent in these studies, our team is poised to identify mCRPC cohorts that may benefit from this\ntreatment paradigm, determine strategies to augment the use of checkpoint inhibitors in this disease, and\nmechanistically define the immune and tumor-intrinsic defects that drive immunoresistance in PCa. Broadly,\nthis project will provide a unique approach for the Immuno-Oncology Translation Network (IOTN) community\nand enable discovery of anti-cancer immunotherapies strategies for PCa that may have larger relevance\nacross the IOTN network and collaborating members of the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.

Using an “in situ vaccine”\nregimen consisting of 12 Gy focal external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and intratumoral (IT) injection of\ntumor-specific antibody (mAb) + IL2, we have eradicated solitary, large, cold syngeneic tumors in mice. This in\nsitu vaccine converts the targeted tumor into a focus of enhanced tumor antigen presentation resulting in\nincreased T-cell infiltration and potent T-cell memory. However, the presence of an identical but untreated\nsecond tumor (2°) on a mouse’s opposite flank inhibits the effect of this treatment, preventing eradication of the\nprimary (1°) tumor treated with EBRT + IT mAb-IL2. In this setting, the untreated 2° tumor causes tumor-\nspecific immune unresponsiveness to EBRT + IT mAb-IL2 at the 1° tumor. We refer to this as concomitant\nimmune tolerance (CIT). We can overcome CIT, and eliminate both tumors by giving IT mAb-IL2 to the 1°\ntumor and EBRT to both the 1° and 2° tumors. Delivering as little as 2 Gy EBRT to the 2° tumor can overcome\nCIT. Clinically, delivery of EBRT (even low dose) to all sites of metastatic disease is problematic, but this can\neffectively be achieved using molecular targeted radiation therapy (MTRT). MTRT is increasingly entering\nclinical oncology practice and our UW team has led preclinical and clinical testing of a novel class of MTRT\nusing alkylphosphocholine (APCh) analogs that selectively deliver radiation to cancers in vivo. These show\ntumor-selective uptake in virtually all mammalian tumor cells and tumor locations tested (including > 90 tumor\nlines and in patients across various clinical trials). In a syngeneic murine melanoma model, we have observed\na potent synergy between systemically administered ICI and MTRT delivered using our next-generation APC\nanalog, 90Y-NM600. In a project that builds upon the ongoing collaborative progress of our multidisciplinary\nteam, we will now systematically optimize the potency of combining MTRT with immunotherapy to enhance\nthe immune response against immunologically cold tumors. In murine models, we will: 1) expand on\npreliminary data showing potent synergy with the combination of MTRT and ICI, 2) evaluate the capacity of\nMTRT to overcome CIT and enhance systemic anti-tumor immune response in the setting of multiple tumors\nwhere one is treated with in situ vaccine (EBRT + IT mAb-IL2) alone or in combination with ICI. Because\nmurine models do not replicate the size and spatial distribution of human metastatic cancer and because these\nfactors strongly influence the dosimetry of MTRT, we will test the immunomodulatory effects of MTRT + in situ\nvaccine in large breed companion canines (pet dogs) with naturally occurring metastatic melanoma. The\ninsights and treatment regimens developed in these studies should enable rapid translation to clinical\ntesting in patients and potentially for any type of metastatic cancer.	90Y;Address;Anatomy;Animals;Antibodies;Antigen Presentation;Biology;Cancer Model;Canis familiaris;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Companions;Data;Disease;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Distant;Dose;Epitope spreading;External Beam Radiation Therapy;Generations;Goals;Half-Life;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Human;IL2 gene;Image;Immune;Immune Evasion;Immune Tolerance;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immunocompetent;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Injections;Intravenous;Isotopes;Length;Location;Low Dose Radiation;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metastatic Melanoma;Modality;Modeling;Molecular Target;Monoclonal Antibodies;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Mus;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Preclinical Testing;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radioisotopes;Regimen;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Safety;Site;Soft tissue sarcoma;Spatial Distribution;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Targeted Radiotherapy;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Translations;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Immunity;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Ursidae Family;Vaccination;Vaccines;Veins;Vision;Work;analog;anti-tumor immune response;cancer site;checkpoint inhibition;dosimetry;efficacy testing;immunogenic;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;insight;mRNA Expression;melanoma;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoantigens;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;novel strategies;pre-clinical;prevent;protein expression;radiation delivery;radiation effect;research clinical testing;response;sarcoma;synergism;systemic toxicity;treatment effect;tumor;tumor eradication;tumor microenvironment;uptake;virtual	UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON	MADISON	WI	UNITED STATES	Zachary Scott Morris,JAMEY P WEICHERT	DCTD	Mansoor M Ahmed	765000	$750k to $999k	765000	3-Sep-2019	18-Sep-2018	31-Aug-2023	RFA-CA-17-045	Moonshot

The growing population of older patients\nremains underrepresented in research that sets cancer care standards leading to significant disparities in\noutcomes. In our preliminary research, we found that: 1) close to 60% of older patients develop grade 3-5\ntoxicity (as measured by NCI's CTCAE) within three months of starting a new treatment regimen; items from\ngeriatric assessment (GA) were significantly associated with toxicity; 2) older patients with advanced cancer\nfrequently experience multiple symptoms that interfere with function and quality of life (QoL); and 3) older\npatients often experience toxicities that lead to early discontinuation of treatment, hospitalizations, and\nmortality. We have an unprecedented opportunity to leverage an existing multi-site cluster randomized study\nthat is currently enrolling adults aged >70 years with age-related conditions who are starting a new treatment\nregimen for advanced cancer in the UR NCORP network (URCC 13059/“GAP”) (n=700). In addition to\nclinician-rated CTCAE, GAP captures PRO measures (PRO-CTCAE, GA, satisfaction) at baseline, 4 weeks, 3\nmonths, and 6 months after the start of the new treatment regimen. Extensive data are collected on clinical\ntolerability metrics including treatment dose modifications, hospitalizations, and mortality. We will collaborate\nwith the U01 consortium to: 1) develop and compare the trajectories of PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated\nCTCAE grades 2-5 in older patients with age-related conditions; 2) evaluate associations between PRO-\nCTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with clinical tolerability metrics; 3) evaluate associations\nbetween PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with PRO endpoints (e.g., function, QoL,\nsatisfaction); and 4) validate a model that identifies older patients with age-related conditions who are at high\nrisk for poor tolerability from treatment for advanced cancer.

project	5U01CA233167-04	U01CA233167	10240520	2021	Understanding Treatment Tolerability in Older Patients with Cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe overarching goal of this five-year grant proposal, submitted on behalf of the University of Rochester NCI\nCommunity Oncology Research Program (UR NCORP) Research Base and the Cancer and Aging Research\nGroup (CARG), in response to RFA-CA-17-052, is: to evaluate whether items from the Patient-Reported\nOutcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) are\nassociated with tolerability of treatment for advanced cancer in older patients with age-related\nconditions (i.e., disability, comorbidity, and geriatric syndromes). The growing population of older patients\nremains underrepresented in research that sets cancer care standards leading to significant disparities in\noutcomes. In our preliminary research, we found that: 1) close to 60% of older patients develop grade 3-5\ntoxicity (as measured by NCI's CTCAE) within three months of starting a new treatment regimen; items from\ngeriatric assessment (GA) were significantly associated with toxicity; 2) older patients with advanced cancer\nfrequently experience multiple symptoms that interfere with function and quality of life (QoL); and 3) older\npatients often experience toxicities that lead to early discontinuation of treatment, hospitalizations, and\nmortality. We have an unprecedented opportunity to leverage an existing multi-site cluster randomized study\nthat is currently enrolling adults aged >70 years with age-related conditions who are starting a new treatment\nregimen for advanced cancer in the UR NCORP network (URCC 13059/“GAP”) (n=700). In addition to\nclinician-rated CTCAE, GAP captures PRO measures (PRO-CTCAE, GA, satisfaction) at baseline, 4 weeks, 3\nmonths, and 6 months after the start of the new treatment regimen. Extensive data are collected on clinical\ntolerability metrics including treatment dose modifications, hospitalizations, and mortality. We will collaborate\nwith the U01 consortium to: 1) develop and compare the trajectories of PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated\nCTCAE grades 2-5 in older patients with age-related conditions; 2) evaluate associations between PRO-\nCTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with clinical tolerability metrics; 3) evaluate associations\nbetween PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with PRO endpoints (e.g., function, QoL,\nsatisfaction); and 4) validate a model that identifies older patients with age-related conditions who are at high\nrisk for poor tolerability from treatment for advanced cancer. Developed with stakeholders, our operational\ndefinition of tolerability is novel; it includes both clinical outcomes and PRO endpoints. The team, which\nincludes expertise in clinical trials (Mohile, Morrow, Janelsins, Kamen), biostatistics and data science\n(Culakova, Heckler, Pandya, Ramsdale, Zand), PRO measurement (Mohile, Duberstein, Chapman, Flannery),\nand collaborations with CARG (Hurria, Dale) and patient advocates (SCOREBoard led by Canin) is uniquely\nsuited to conduct this research. This research will address a critical gap in knowledge of how patient-reported\ntoxicity informs tolerability of treatment in older patients with advanced cancer and age-related conditions.

This has\nled to a resurgence of interest in immune-based approaches. While augmenting immunity has been successful\nin other malignancies like melanoma and leukemia/lymphoma, their efficacy in treatment of brain tumors has\nbeen very limited. Tumor antigen heterogeneity, limited number of infiltrating lymphocytes at the tumor site,\nand failure of checkpoint inhibitor drugs to cross the blood brain barrier all represent major obstacles to\neffective immune-therapies in GBM. Altered immunity in patients with GBM further contributes to the poor\nprognoses of these tumors and their relative resistance to vaccine and checkpoint inhibitors. Utilizing healthy\ndonor immune cells in the form of adoptive cell therapy may offer a more effective alternative. However, limited\ninformation is available on the properties of effector populations that would exert effective anti-tumor activity in\nthe brain. Pioneering work by Dr. Rick Jones at Johns Hopkins University utilizing haploidentical donor\ntransplant (haplo-BMT) for brain tumors offers an opportunity to test kinetics of infused healthy donor immune\ncells in this patient population, providing a glimpse of what donor immune cells can do against brain tumors.\nPrevious experiences with haplo-BMT suggest that effector cells of the innate immunity – natural killer cells\n(NKs) and invariant natural killer T cells (iNKTs) – mediate anti-tumor activity with decreased frequency of\nrelapse. Innate immune cells are also potentially advantageous in the brain tumor setting, which affords very\nlittle tolerance for the adverse events associated with (for example) CD19-CAR T cell based-therapies. Finally,\nboth iNKT and NK cells can actively migrate to the site of GBM following the CCL2 gradient, the chemokine\nreleased by tumor cells and the surrounding tumor associated macrophages (TAM). Dr. Savoldo at\nUniversity of North Carolina has unique expertise in the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)\ntransduced T cells and iNKT cells and Dr. Bollard at Children's National has extensive experience with the\ngenetically modified T cells and NK cells. Hence, in this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that\nnontolerized innate immune cells (NKs and iNKTs) derived from healthy donors will promote anti-\ntumor immunity in patients GBM, and may be developed as effective cellular therapies. This overarching\nhypothesis will be tested in 3 Specific Aims where Dr. Jones (Aim 1) will compare the cellular signatures of\niNKTs and NK cells isolated from healthy donors versus patients with GBM. In Aim 2, Dr. Savoldo and the\nUNC team will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of healthy donor iNKT and NK cells modified to express an anti-\nB7H3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and in Aim 3, Drs. Bollard and Cruz at CNMC overcome the inhibitory\ntumor microenvironment in GBM by targeting immune suppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and\nTGFβ.

project	5U01CA243644-02	U01CA243644	10264876	2021	Prospective Trial of a Linguistically and Culturally Appropriate Mainstreaming Model for Hereditary Cancer Multigene Panel Testing Among Diverse Cancer Patients	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nEfficient yet effective models for delivering genetic counseling and testing are sorely needed to meet\nincreasing demands for timely genetic risk information. Traditional germline genetic testing models, which\ninclude in-depth genetic counseling both before and after testing, are time intensive and place substantial\ndemands on the limited genetic counselor workforce. A “mainstreaming” model, which allows for non-genetics\nhealthcare providers to order genetic testing without pre-test genetic counseling, with support from genetic\ncounselors at the time of result disclosure, has shown promise. Yet, past evaluations of mainstreaming models\nhave been hampered by serious limitations: Studies were restricted to the context of BRCA1/2 testing and do\nnot reflect the growing use of multigene panel testing (MGPT); rarely used rigorous experimental study designs\nor evaluated theoretically-relevant decision-making, psychosocial, and communication outcomes; have not\ncapitalized on opportunities to improve post-test clinical and familial communication; and neither included nor\naddressed informational needs of minority and medically underserved patients. We overcome these limitations\nwith the proposed study, the objective of which is to develop, test, and evaluate a linguistically and culturally\nappropriate mainstreaming (LCAM) model for hereditary cancer MGPT among cancer patients diverse in\nrace/ethnicity, language, and education. We will first use formative research methods, including transcreation\nand cognitive interviewing, to adapt existing pre-test educational materials and post-test clinical communication\nmaterials for use among the diverse population treated at our community hospital partnering sites (Kings\nCounty Hospital Center, Queens Cancer Center). Next, we will conduct an RCT involving English, Haitian\nCreole, or Spanish-speaking patients diagnosed with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer (N=500).\nPatients will be randomized to obtain access to cancer MGPT through either: i) standard-of-care wherein in-\ndepth pre-test and post-test genetic counseling are provided via telegenetics (i.e., videoconferencing delivered\nat the site clinic) with standard post-test clinical communication materials, or ii) LCAM intervention wherein\npatients receive the adapted pre-test educational materials with testing ordered by their oncologist, followed by\npost-test genetic counseling provided via telephone with adapted clinical communication materials. Patients\nwill complete assessments of decision-making, psychosocial, and behavioral outcomes at baseline, upon\ndeciding whether to have MGPT, and at 1-week and 6-months following receipt of their test results. Long-term\nengagement among patients who receive a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) result will also be explored\none year after result receipt through uptake of an offer to discuss any changes in cancer risk or variant\nreclassification and an additional assessment. This research has the potential to transform genetic counseling\nand testing practice by promoting effective risk communication, decision making, and more equitable delivery\nof genomic medicine to those at risk of hereditary cancer syndromes.

Hereditary cancer\nsyndromes are more common than previously appreciated, and genetic testing is standard of care to\nestablish these diagnoses. Genetic test results are also critical to guiding targeted therapies in patients\nwith established tumors such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Genetic counselors have traditionally\nmanaged the testing process, but there is a critical shortage of counselors and they are not able to meet\nthe demand for testing. Without a genetic counselor, effective communication of testing options, outcomes,\nand risks could be compromised. One of the most challenging decisions is the choice of gene panel. Multi-\ngene panels are now the norm, but panels can include as few as 5 or as many as 125 genes. Panels can\ninclude genes associated with a single tumor type or multiple tumor types, and genes with weaker evidence\nfor pathogenicity may also be included. There is no consensus on what constitutes an ideal panel, and\nthe choice of panel is therefore highly individualized. Innovative strategies to support patients facing these\ntime-sensitive and complex pre-test decisions are needed.\nDecision aids are well-suited to address this challenge by providing education, facilitating the process of\ninformed choice, clarifying personal preferences, and promoting shared decision making. We propose to\ndevelop an electronic decision aid to assist individuals in choosing a multi-gene panel with their medical\noncologist instead of a genetic counselor. We will test the hypothesis that a decision aid without a genetic\ncounselor can facilitate quality decisions around the selection of a specific multi-gene panel. In addition\nto positive changes in knowledge, shared decision making, and decisional conflict, we anticipate that the\ndecision aid will increase access to genetic testing in a timely manner. Utilizing an effectiveness-\nimplementation hybrid study design, we propose these specific aims: (1) To develop and pilot electronic\ndecision aids for selection of a multi-gene panel in ovarian and pancreatic cancer patients. (2) To evaluate\nthe efficacy of the decision aid with an oncologist versus a traditional genetic counselor session for multi-\ngene panel testing in a randomized clinical trial at multiple institutions. (3) To evaluate the effectiveness of\nimplementation of the decision aid in multiple, diverse populations.\nThese decision aids will establish a much needed and new paradigm for quality decision making and\ncommunication around multi-gene panel testing for inherited cancer syndromes. This format will uniquely\naddress the current barriers that include the complex decision of which multi-gene panel to select, limited\ngenetic counselor resources, and lack of time and expertise on the part of practicing oncologists.

Yet, access to genetic specialists is limited in many areas\nin the US, and <20% of eligible patients with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer complete\ngenetic testing. Thus, there is an urgent need to consider alternative delivery models to increase access and\nuptake of genetic testing, while maintaining adequate patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes. Our\nresearch has shown that providing remote services increases uptake of genetic testing in community practices\nincreases uptake of genetic testing. Preliminary data from our ongoing NIH-funded RESPECT study has\nrevealed high interest in a web-based eHealth alternative to traditional pre-test counseling and no significant no\ndifferences in pre- and post-disclosure outcomes when the web-based eHealth intervention is utilized as\ncompared to participants who received traditional pre-test genetic counselor. To address the clinically significant\nneed for alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of cancer genetic testing, while maintaining\nadequate patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes, we propose to recruit a nationally diverse “real-\nworld” sample of 1000 patients who have access barriers to genetic testing and to conduct a Hybrid Type 1\neffectiveness-implementation study to evaluate web-based eHealth delivery alternatives for genetic education\nand testing. We hypothesize that our theoretically and stakeholder informed eHealth delivery alternatives can\nprovide equal or better uptake of testing and outcomes of genetic testing as compared to the traditional model\nof pre- and post-test counseling with a genetic counselor. We will partner with several cancer advocacy groups\n(ASCO, breastcancer.org, Cancer Support Community, Pennsylvania Prostate Cancer Coalition) to recruit\npatients to this randomized non-inferiority study using a modified 2x2 design (Aims 1-2). In Arm 1, traditional\npre-test (visit 1) and post-test (visit 2: disclosure) counseling will be provided remotely through the national Penn\nTelegenetics Program and compared to delivery arms where patients can complete pre-test and/or disclosure of\nresults through a self-directed web-based eHealth intervention, either in place of, or as an adjunct to traditional\ngenetic counseling. Concurrently, we will conduct a CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation\nResearch)-informed process evaluation to understand moderators of intervention usage and patient outcomes\nand facilitators and barriers to future implementation and sustainability of this novel eHealth alternative delivery\nmodel for genetic services both within and beyond cancer care (Aim 3). We hypothesize that a rigorously\ndeveloped theoretically and stake-holder informed eHealth delivery alternative provided through a centralized\nTelegenetics Program has the potential to provide equal or improved patient outcomes, while reducing genetic\nprovider time and providing access to services in community practices where access to genetic services has\nbeen limited, providing opportunities to realize the promise of precision medicine in oncology.

project	5U01CA246568-02	U01CA246568	10020353	2020	Utility of memantine in preventing cognitive dysfunction in children receiving cranial radiotherapy	Grant	ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether oral memantine daily for 6 months, when compared to\nplacebo, is associated with reduction in decline of cognitive function at 12 months in children ages 4-18\nreceiving cranial radiotherapy (RT) for primary central nervous system tumors and to correlate protective\neffects of memantine with imaging biomarkers. Radiotherapy is a proven curative therapeutic tool in the\ntreatment of primary brain tumors. However, cranial RT results in significant cognitive morbidity. The\nmechanisms of radiation-induced injury result in a picture that is a combination of the small vessel disease\nseen with vascular dementia as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s dementia. Ischemia\nand injury can induce excessive NMDA stimulation and lead to excitotoxicity, and pre- clinical data suggests\nthat selective blocking of the NMDA receptor can restore long-term potentiation and restore learning in both\nmodels of ischemia as well as models of radiation injury. Memantine is a non- competitive, low-affinity, open-\nchannel NMDA blocker, which has been shown to be neuroprotective in pre- clinical models. In two placebo-\ncontrolled phase III trials, memantine proved to be effective treatment for Alzheimer’s and vascular\ndementia, especially for patients with small-vessel disease. Memantine has also proven effective in reducing\ncognitive dysfunction in adults receiving whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases. Memantine delayed\ntime to cognitive decline and reduced the rate of decline in memory, executive function and processing\nspeed. Importantly, cognitive function in patients receiving memantine remained stable even after\nmemantine was discontinued; suggesting memantine had a protective effect rather than simply a therapeutic\neffect. In this study, we propose evaluating the efficacy of memantine in preventing cognitive dysfunction in\npediatric patients receiving cranial radiation through the clinical trial mechanism of the Children’s Oncology\nGroup. This study is novel in that children will undergo early cognitive evaluations (baseline prior to\nradiation, 3, 6, and 12 months post-radiation) with a brief computerized testing battery that we will correlate\nwith formal cognitive testing as well with long-term cognitive function (30 and 60 months) assessed with both\nmethods. If successful, this study will provide validated early cognitive assessment time points that correlate\nwith late cognitive toxicity and result in an framework for accelerated study design that will allow for early\nassessment of efficacy for future neuro-protectant trials. Dose- and volume-dependent reduction in brain\nvolume is seen after radiotherapy exposure and is associated with cognitive decline. We hypothesize that\nneuroprotection with memantine will also preserve relevant brain volume and this will correlate with domain-\nspecific improvements in cognitive function. We will use quantitative volumetric MRI analysis to correlate\nprotective effects of memantine with brain substructure (white matter, hippocampus, frontal lobes etc) volume\nchanges over time and correlate with cognitive assessments. Radiographic analysis will provide proof-of-\nprinciple for the mechanism of action of memantine as well as a biomarker that can be utilized in future trials\nof radio-protectants, which is especially important for young patients or patients not neurologically capable of\ncompleting cognitive assessments but who may benefit the most from neuroprotective interventions.

The SyMon-SAYS will administer, score, interpret and display\nthe results of symptom assessments in “real-time” between clinic visits in cancer care ambulatory settings,\nwhen patients are likely to be more symptomatic. We hypothesize that this system can facilitate prompt\nidentification of problematic symptoms; consequently, with the availability of graphical symptom reports over\ntime, timely providers’ clinical care, and an informative symptom management booklet, patients will become\ninformed about their condition and take an active role in treatment, which will further improve self-management\nskills.

To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections,\nalmost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and\ncommunities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and\naffordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and\nmore likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies\namong AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating\nthat the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing\nPA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0-\n20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the\nefficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal\nlevel) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a\nprivate Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community\nlevel) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA\ntracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other\nactivities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be\nrecruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site\nRCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group,\nto achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 -\nTo improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life.\nAnalyses of hypothesized mediation factors for Aims 1-3 and post-trial qualitative interviews among participants\nwith and without private health insurance will provide explanatory knowledge to help refine intervention\nprocedures and tailor the intervention for future RCTs among patient subgroups who will most benefit. If shown\nto be efficacious, this mHealth intervention to improve PA in AYA survivors is highly scalable because\nsmartphones and social media are widespread, PA trackers are popular and affordable, goal setting can be\nautomated, and social media activities do not require specialized staff.

Although cytokine release\nsyndrome and neurotoxicity are the earliest and most dramatic immune related adverse events (irAEs) after\nCARTx, severe manifestations are transient and only affect a minority of patients. In contrast, on-target, off-\ntumor depletion of non-malignant B lineage cells affects the majority of patients and all long-term responders.\nCD19 expression declines as B cells differentiate into plasma cells, whereas BCMA is selectively expressed by\nplasma cells. Since plasma cells are responsible for maintaining long-lived antibodies and naïve/memory B cells\nare important for generating new immunity, CD19 versus BCMA-CARTx may differentially affect preexisting\nimmunity and vaccine responses. Dr. Hill’s goal is to understand the long-term effects of CARTx on humoral\nimmunity. This proposal incorporates the expertise of an outstanding group of researchers in infectious diseases,\nimmuno-oncology, epidemiology, laboratory medicine, and statistics who are dedicated to ensuring the success\nof this innovative research proposal. They will leverage their expertise and high-volume immunotherapy\nprograms to achieve the following aims.\nThe first Aim involves a prospective observational cohort study of 130 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 50\npediatric CD19, 30 adult BCMA) with relapse-free survival ≥6 months. Dr. Hill will use a novel systematic viral\nepitope scanning method (VirScan) to longitudinally characterize the antivirome to 206 viral pathogens. These\nresults will describe, and identify correlates of, antivirome diversity metrics at 6- and 12-months post-CARTx.\nVirScan will allow for a nuanced assessment of the differential impacts of CARTx on humoral immune\ncompetence. The second Aim will utilize samples from Aim 1 to determine the effect of CARTx on the durability\nof preexisting humoral immunity to vaccine-preventable infections and the proportion of patients lacking\nseroprotection after CARTx. These data will expand on Aim 1 to inform vaccination strategies. In the third Aim,\nDr. Hill will perform a prospective observational study of 95 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 25 pediatric CD19,\nand 20 adult BCMA) to define the frequency and correlates of positive vaccine responses ≥6 months after\nCARTx. Patients will be vaccinated for S. pneumoniae, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, H. influenza b, and\nhepatitis A and B according to institutional guidelines.\nThis proposal will address critical knowledge gaps by employing innovative methods to elucidate the scope of\npathogen-specific deficits in humoral immunity, and whether vaccination can mitigate these irAEs, after CARTx.\nThe findings will guide evidence-based strategies for infection prevention, such as vaccination or immunoglobulin\nreplacement, to improve outcomes in this rapidly growing population of high-risk individuals.

Several of these therapies have now gained FDA approval and are part of routine treatment\nregimens for several malignancies. Despite the overall success of immunotherapeutic regimens, existing\nmodalities present complications that current research efforts seek to overcome: (1) systemic delivery of\ncheckpoint blockade monoclonal antibodies lead to diverse and unpredictable immune-related adverse events\n(irAE), (2) boosting responses from the endogenous antitumor repertoire often relies on the existence of pre-\nprimed antitumor T cells, which in the case of highly immunosuppressive tumors or those with low mutational\nburden may be extremely rare, and (3) attempts to combine immunotherapies to additively boost T cell responses\ndemonstrate increased on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Thus, to circumvent toxicity and immunosuppression,\ncontemporary strategies focus on developing methods to deliver potent immunostimulants directly into a tumor,\nlocally priming antitumor T cells to attack disseminated metastases exhibiting a similar antigenic profile. Bridging\nthese observations, the goals of this proposal are to engineer probiotic strains of bacteria that selectively colonize\ncolorectal cancer (CRC) and locally release immune checkpoint blockade. We hypothesize that this approach\nwill result in more robust and diversified antitumor T cell immunity and promote the clearance of colonized\nprimary and metastatic colorectal cancer lesions and systemically growing CRC-derived foci. The primary\ninnovations of this proposal are in engineering probiotics as an immunotherapeutic delivery vector to locally\nrelease high-dose immune checkpoint blockade. Specifically, the proposed system has several advantages over\ncurrent therapeutic strategies, including: (1) tumor-specific production of immunotherapies and LPS adjuvant,\n(2) bacteria lysis, leading to effective release of novel immunotherapeutics and LPS, (3) local delivery of novel\nimmunotherapeutics that are toxic to deliver systemically, and (4) oral delivery of probiotics that selectively\ncolonize CRC metastases. This work seeks to shift current research and clinical practice paradigms to overcome\ncurrent limitations of immunotherapies, by providing a unique vehicle to locally deliver immunotherapies that\nstimulate antitumor immunity while preventing systemic toxicity and mitigating irAE.

However, CART-evoked severe or fatal immune-related adverse\nevents (irAE) including cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) are significant clinical barriers and safety concerns\nthat impede CART use in cancer patients, even with strict patient monitoring and supportive care. Current tools\nfor mitigating such immunotoxicities/CRS target individual cytokines/receptors (e.g. IL-6R, IL-1Ra, GM-CSF) or\nnonspecific immunosuppression, but preventing and treating such toxicity will require better understanding of\ncellular/molecular mediators of CART-induced CRS. This project aims to overcome these barriers and enable\nmore effective interventions against immunotoxicities, and thus more effective CART treatments, building upon\nthe PIs' novel, potentially translatable findings of a key role of catecholamines (CATs) in shaping CART therapy-\nassociated immune activation. We found that blocking CAT synthesis both reduced CRS during CART therapy\nin mice and also enhanced its tumor eradication, and also found that CAT levels are elevated in patients with\nCART-evoked CRS, and correlated with symptoms and IL-6 levels, suggesting CATs contribute to human CRS\npathophysiology. The project's goal is to identify the mechanistic CRS-modulating roles of these novel CAT\nactions and their impacts on macrophages and anti-tumor responses, and assess translational potential for\nimproving CART cancer therapy outcomes using human patient samples. Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the\nmediating α1-AR subtype and its role in modulating CART-evoked cytokine release and anti-tumor responses in\nvitro and in vivo, based on our finding that CAT-associated cytokine release is mediated by α1-adrenergic\nreceptors (α1-AR), of as-yet unknown subtype(s). We will identify the α1-AR subtype(s) that mainly mediate(s)\nCAT-evoked cytokine production in macrophages and CART, using in vitro co-culture assays and a mouse CART\ntherapy model via genetic knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) of α1-AR subtypes. 2) Determine the impact of\nmyeloid-derived CATs on cytokine release and myeloid function during CART-therapy in vitro and in a mouse\nmodel, by inactivating CAT synthesis in myeloid cells via tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) KO, and assess its impact\non cytokine release and macrophage function in a co-culture assay and in vivo using a LysM-Cre-mediated TH\nKO mouse. 3) Assess CAT induction in human patients during CART therapy, and CATs' dual impacts on irAE\nand tumor responses, and potential utility of CAT measures and blockers in predicting and preventing CRS, by\nquantifying circulating CAT and cytokine levels in patient serum samples collected during CART therapy, and\nevaluating correlations of CAT levels with clinical and laboratory CRS indices, anti-tumor responses and survival.

To date, most cancer research has employed established cancer cell lines and\ngenetically engineered mouse models. Although these models have provided tremendous insight into many\naspects of cancer initiation and progression, each of these models has important limitations, including adaptation\nto culture (cell lines), lack of genomic instability (mouse models), and inadequate representation of the spectrum\nof mutations and subtypes of human cancers. Next generation cancer models (NGCMs) such as organoid\nmodels have recently been developed. NGCMs address many deficits of prior models and promise to accelerate\ncancer research and experimental therapeutic efforts.\n Recent methodological advances now make it possible to create patient-derived cancer cell lines and\norganoids with increased efficiency. When coupled with genomic analysis, these new models may facilitate new\ninsights into human cancers. However, organoids require complex culture conditions and display distinct\nproperties that pose challenges for implementation of standard molecular and cell biology techniques. To\nfacilitate widespread use of organoid models within the research community, we must develop innovative\ntechnologies to overcome these challenges and enable study of organoids for a range of cancer phenotypes.\n In this Project, we will build on our expertise in the development of genome scale and informatic methods as\nwell as our work to derive many of the HCMI models with the goal of developing high throughput approaches to\nperform genetic and small molecule screens in patient-derived organoids created by the Human Cancer Models\nInitiative (HCMI). In addition, we will use innovative methods to interrogate cell state plasticity and heterogeneity\nin these models. These studies will allow the cancer research community to perform both high and low throughput\nanalyses in patient-derived models and to provide deep insight into the stability and phenotypes represented by\nthese models. While we will focus our technology development efforts using pancreatic cancer organoids, we\nanticipate that the approaches developed in this proposal will be widely applicable to many different models from\na range of cancer types.\n In Aim 1, we will develop and implement a highly multiplexed method to screen patient-derived organoid\nmodels with both small molecules and genetic reagents. These studies will provide a powerful approach to\ninterrogating HCMI models at high throughput. In Aim 2, we will build on our preliminary studies that indicate that\npatient-derived organoids exhibit heterogeneity and rapid shifts in expressed phenotypes. We will interrogate\nthe dynamics of these state changes and assess the degrees of heterogeneity in these models using newly\ndeveloped physical and sequencing methodology.

To date, most cancer research has employed established cancer cell lines and\ngenetically engineered mouse models. Although these models have provided tremendous insight into many\naspects of cancer initiation and progression, each of these models has important limitations, including adaptation\nto culture (cell lines), lack of genomic instability (mouse models), and inadequate representation of the spectrum\nof mutations and subtypes of human cancers. Next generation cancer models (NGCMs) such as organoid\nmodels have recently been developed. NGCMs address many deficits of prior models and promise to accelerate\ncancer research and experimental therapeutic efforts.\n Recent methodological advances now make it possible to create patient-derived cancer cell lines and\norganoids with increased efficiency. When coupled with genomic analysis, these new models may facilitate new\ninsights into human cancers. However, organoids require complex culture conditions and display distinct\nproperties that pose challenges for implementation of standard molecular and cell biology techniques. To\nfacilitate widespread use of organoid models within the research community, we must develop innovative\ntechnologies to overcome these challenges and enable study of organoids for a range of cancer phenotypes.\n In this Project, we will build on our expertise in the development of genome scale and informatic methods as\nwell as our work to derive many of the HCMI models with the goal of developing high throughput approaches to\nperform genetic and small molecule screens in patient-derived organoids created by the Human Cancer Models\nInitiative (HCMI). In addition, we will use innovative methods to interrogate cell state plasticity and heterogeneity\nin these models. These studies will allow the cancer research community to perform both high and low throughput\nanalyses in patient-derived models and to provide deep insight into the stability and phenotypes represented by\nthese models. While we will focus our technology development efforts using pancreatic cancer organoids, we\nanticipate that the approaches developed in this proposal will be widely applicable to many different models from\na range of cancer types.\n In Aim 1, we will develop and implement a highly multiplexed method to screen patient-derived organoid\nmodels with both small molecules and genetic reagents. These studies will provide a powerful approach to\ninterrogating HCMI models at high throughput. In Aim 2, we will build on our preliminary studies that indicate that\npatient-derived organoids exhibit heterogeneity and rapid shifts in expressed phenotypes. We will interrogate\nthe dynamics of these state changes and assess the degrees of heterogeneity in these models using newly\ndeveloped physical and sequencing methodology. In Aim 3, we will build on Project Achilles and the DepMap\n(www.DepMap.org) to create and implement an optimized genome scale CRISPR-Cas9 library that permits the\nsystematic genetic interrogation of genetic dependencies in patient-derived organoids.\n We anticipate that these studies will create new methods that permit rigorous evaluation of HCMI models as\nwell as the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer.

These Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter\nOrganoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) include: Synthetic Promoter\nActivated Recombination of Kaleidoscopic Organoids (SPARKO), Combinatorial Genetics En\nMasse (CombiGEM), and single-cell RNA sequencing panorama (Scanorama). SPARKO can annotate\nheterogeneous cancer populations in living cells via fluorescent protein expression libraries to make multi-\ncolored tumor organoids. CombiGEM can rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets via large-scale,\nmassively parallel, and unbiased combinatorial genetic screens. Scanorama can integrate the analysis\nof large datasets of single-cell transcriptomics via sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. These tools\nfocus on barcoding strategies to enable accurate tracking and analysis of individual tumor cells that harbor\ndistinct genetic aberrations, and substantially expand the utility of the Next Generation Cancer Models\n(NGCMs) for cancer mechanistic investigations or therapeutic discovery. The StarOrchard tools enable\ntargeted genetic perturbations in annotated heterogeneous tumor phenotypes without destroying cells for\nsequencing. These tools will be applied to a large number and variety of NGCMs to optimize experimental\nprotocol. To ensure success, we have convened an outstanding team: PI Timothy K. Lu, MD, PhD, has\nmade strikingly original contributions to Synthetic Biology tools that enable high-throughput genetic\ninterrogation of cancer cell drug dependency; PI Ömer Yilmaz, MD, PhD, has extensive expertise in cancers\nof the gastrointestinal tract and has developed novel technologies to maintain patient-derived colon cancer\norganoids for in vivo modeling; and PI Bonnie Berger, PhD, will use her expertise in bioinformatics and\nher Scanorama algorithm to integrate data across all tumor types based on dynamic single cell RNA\nsequencing (scRNAseq). We are also supported by leading experts in cancer biology and various cancer\ntypes at both the basic science and clinical oncology frontiers of cancer research.

project	5U01CA250565-02	U01CA250565	10229465	2021	Advanced tools for HCMI model genetic perturbation and metastasis characterization	Grant	ABSTRACT\nThe Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI) is creating next generation cancer models that will drive the future\nof cancer precision medicine research. Historical cancer cell lines have been selected for their rapid proliferation\non tissue culture plastic, which has made them amenable to high throughput screening such as genome-wide\nCRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screens. However, the historical lines have large gaps in their representation of the\ndiversity of human cancer, and they may lack physiological relevance given their optimization for rapid\nproliferation. Next generation HCMI models address these concerns, but will require the development of new\nmethods to make them useful. Specifically, standard approaches to genome editing (involving first creating Cas9-\nstably expressing lines and then introducing guide RNAs) will not work for slowly proliferating cells often growing\nin 3D. We will therefore develop all-in-one genome editing vector systems that will make it possible to bring the\npower of genome editing to HCMI models. In addition, standard viability read-outs of such “drop-out” screens\ninvolve the growth of cells over many population doublings. But for slowly proliferating HCMI models, alternative\nreadouts will be required for efficient screening. We will therefore develop short-term single cell RNA sequencing\n(scRNAseq) methods that will serve as surrogate read-outs for long-term viability. Given the clinical annotation\nassociated with HCMI models, there is also enormous opportunity to expand the use of these models beyond\nviability measures to more complex, physiologically relevant phenotypes such as organ-specific metastatic\npotential. We will therefore develop methods that make it possible to determine the metastatic potential for next\ngeneration cancer models, and we will create a public resource of the metastasis map (MetMap) for at least 50\nHCMI models. All data and protocols will be made publicly available without restriction, all reagents will be made\navailable via Addgene, and all modified models made available to ATCC for distribution. Importantly, throughout\nthe project, all cell models will be rigorously monitored for evidence of genetic and epigenetic drift. At the\nconclusion of the proposed project, we expect to have generated a set of tools and data that will help propel the\nfuture of cancer precision medicine based on next generation cancer models.	3-Dimensional;Address;Bar Codes;Benchmarking;Brain;CRISPR screen;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Model;Cancer cell line;Cell model;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Communities;Complex;Computational Science;Consumption;Data;Development;Dropout;Ensure;Enzymes;Epigenetic Process;Future;Gene Expression Profiling;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Screening;Growth;Guide RNA;Human;Immunodeficient Mouse;Injections;Kidney;Knock-out;Libraries;Liver;Lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organ;Organoids;Outcome;Phenotype;Physiological;Population;Proliferating;Protocols documentation;Reagent;Research;Resources;System;Systems Biology;Time;Translational Research;Ultrasonography;anticancer research;base;bone;cell growth;cost;experimental study;functional genomics;gene discovery;genome editing;genome-wide;high throughput screening;in vivo;innovation;model development;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;next generation;patient response;precision medicine;precision oncology;scale up;screening;single-cell RNA sequencing;targeted treatment;technology development;tissue culture;tool;tumor;tumor microenvironment;vector	BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.

project	5U01CA254822-02	U01CA254822	10264043	2021	A population-based virtual solution to reduce gaps in genetic risk evaluation and management in families at high risk for hereditary cancer syndromes:  The Georgia-California GeneLINK Trial	Grant	Project Abstract: There is growing evidence that targeting genetic risk evaluation (GRE) in families where a\ncancer susceptibility gene pathogenic variant (PV) has been identified may be the most cost-effective\napproach to reduce the population burden of cancer through prevention. However, there are enormous\nchallenges to implementing successful cascade genetic risk evaluation in families with hereditary cancer\nsyndromes. The clinical context of GRE after cancer diagnosis is increasingly complex: As MGP testing has\nbecome the norm, guideline organizations have converged on a list of >40 cancer susceptibility genes in which\nPVs are clinically actionable, with wide variability in cancer threat and a myriad of strategies for prevention and\nearly detection. A daunting challenge is that the cancer patient is responsible for communication and\nengagement of relatives for GRE. Despite the shared health threat among at risk relatives (ARRs), the social\nand contextual factors that affect family communication are complex. Furthermore, ARRs are dispersed world-\nwide and receive care in disparate health care practices. Importantly, there is little incentive and limited\nresources for clinicians to engage cancer patients’ relatives and genetic counseling services are increasingly\nstrained. Given the lack of guidance for families, it is not surprising that most ARRs of cancer patients with PVs\ndo not undergo GRE. We are uniquely positioned to develop and optimize a direct-to-family virtual genetic risk\nevaluation and testing solution offered to all at risk relatives of a population-based sample of adults recently\ndiagnosed with cancer in Georgia and California who tested positive for a clinically relevant PV. We will use a\nunique data infrastructure we pioneered to identify and invite a diverse cohort of cancer patients with clinically\nrelevant PVs and their families to participate in our study. We propose a 2 x 3 factorial randomized trial of 900\npatients diagnosed in 2018-2019 in the two states who had a clinically significant PV detected by genetic\ntesting that will offer genetic risk evaluation and testing to all 1st and 2nd degree relatives. We will evaluate the\neffects of two intervention design features on patient- and relative-centered outcomes: 1) the level of\npersonalized family genetic risk support (a technology assisted personally tailored patient and family member\neducation and communication tool called the Family Genetic Health Program, FGHP) vs. the FGHP plus direct\nassistance from a human FGHP Navigator); and 2) the price offered to the relatives for the genetic test\n(standard $200 vs. $100 vs. $50 per test). We will determine the independent effects of the two design\nfeatures on 1) the cancer patient’s appraisal of communication and their engagement with relatives about\nhereditary cancer and GRE; 2) the invited relative’s appraisal of decision-making and receipt of genetic testing;\nand 3) on the enrolled relative’s completion of formal GRE. We will also explore the effect of the features on\nthe outcomes across patient SES subgroups. The findings of this study have enormous potential to improve\ncancer prevention and early detection in families at high risk of hereditary cancer syndromes in the US.

Rather, it is critical to access\nappropriate follow-up care that may include cancer risk management (CRM) options for\nindividuals and their at-risk family members. Current gaps in implementation of\nguideline-adherent follow-up care based on inherited cancer genetic test results include\nboth over and under treatment among those with pathogenic and likely pathogenic\n(P/LP) variants or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Furthermore, we are missing\nthe opportunity to magnify the uptake and impact of testing among family members who\nare at high risk due to suboptimal family communication (FC) of genetic test results and\ncancer family history. Our highly innovative and practice-changing study is designed to\nshift the paradigm by which individuals with P/LP variants and VUS in inherited cancer\ngenes are provided with information to enhance guideline-adherent CRM and FC of test\nresults. Through our proposed type I effectiveness-implementation hybrid randomized\ncontrol mixed methods study, we will test two interventions with a diverse group of 600\nindividuals with a P/LP variant or a VUS result in a variety of inherited cancer genes for\nwhich CRM guidelines are available. Intervention A is focused on increasing guideline-\nadherent CRM (LivingLabReport), and Intervention B is focused on increasing FC and\nsubsequent family testing (GeneSHARE). Alongside developing, refining, and testing\ninterventions to improve guideline-adherent CRM and FC, we will study the\nimplementation of these interventions across racially, geographically, and socio-\neconomically diverse populations and settings. The information gathered through testing\neffectiveness and implementation of the interventions will be used to develop, modify\nand pilot test adaptive stepped interventions with the potential to efficiently maximize\neffectiveness in improving guideline-adherent CRM and FC. This transdisciplinary effort,\nenriched for accrual of Blacks, rural dwellers, and other underserved populations, will\ninform policy and the development of scalable models for delivering evidence-based\ncare. Ultimately, our study will help address the need for access to effective information\nto guide CRM and enhance FC in diverse populations across various genes and settings\nwhich is greatly needed if the population at large is to benefit from genomic advances in\nthis era of personalized medicine.

Together, these studies will address the\nhypothesis that autologous NeoAg-specific T cells can eradicate HNSCC tumors as well as defining the key\nquantitative and qualitative parameters governing therapeutic efficacy.

However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it\npossible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence\nat a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor\ncells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune-\nstimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine\nRT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the\ntypes of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating\neffects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral\ncancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived\nsuppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate.\nStudies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an\nimmunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti-\ntumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor\nmicroenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of\ntumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1)\ndetermine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer\nto RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the\nimmunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug\nformulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will\naccomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims:\nIn Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance\nin mouse oral cancer models.\nIn Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment\nwith RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses.\nIn Aim 3 we will develop a novel drug delivery system that can enhance delivery of inhibitors of MDSC function\ndirectly to the tumor and tumor-infiltrating MDSC.

project	5U01DK124165-02	U01DK124165	10176481	2021	Characterizing and predicting colitis in immune checkpoint blockade-treated cancer patients	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\n The first combination immunotherapy of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) approved for\nmelanoma in 2015 has achieved longer progression-free survival compared to nivolumab alone (11.5 vs. 6.9\nmonths), with 53% of patients still alive at 4 years, of whom 71% remain treatment free. Yet, safety is the\nbiggest barrier to broader implementation of this successful combination, due to much greater occurrence of\nserious immune-related adverse events (irAEs) compared to nivolumab alone. In particular, immune-related\ncolitis (irColitis) is the most common occurrence, with 10-15% of patients developing it upon receiving anti-\nCTLA-4 alone or in combinations. Such irColitis is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment with high-\ndose steroids or biologics such as anti-TNF, as well as ipilimumab or immunotherapy discontinuation. These\nsafety concerns have hampered the development of CTLA-4 targeting agents and may have reduced their\nefficacy due to lower recommended dosing in combination therapy and limited treatment course. There is\ntherefore an urgent need to comprehensively study the nature of irColitis and find whether potential risk factors\ncould be identified and mitigated for greater safety and efficacy of combination treatments.\n We have assembled a unique team of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) scientists and clinicians, tumor\nimmunologists, microbiome specialists, and medical oncologists specializing in immunotherapy of melanoma to\nanalyze colorectal tissue lesions, the gut microbiome, and peripheral blood biomarkers that could predict or\ncontribute to development of irColitis. By comparing what we already learned from studying biospecimens of\nIBD patients, i.e., their genetic subsets at the single cell level, gut microbiome, and predictive immune\nsignatures, we aim to characterize the transcriptomic, immunopathologic, serologic, and gut microbiome\nlandscape of irColitis and leverage this knowledge for better therapeutic options.\n We will address irColitis by characterizing gut biopsies of melanoma patients during treatment using single-\ncell RNA sequencing and multiplex immunohistochemistry mapping, and we will relate immune subsets and\nmarkers discovered to those found in IBD lesions. We will also measure peripheral blood serologic markers\n(anti-microbial and anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies by ELISA, soluble cytokine and protein analytes with Olink\nproximity extension assay) that we recently found to be risk factors detectable prior to development of IBD, and\nanalyze them for their capacity to predict irColitis. From stool collected before and throughout treatment, we\nwill analyze by 16S and metagenomic sequencing the gut microbiome of melanoma patients with or without\nirColitis to compare it to known colitogenic structure in IBD, and functionally assess bacterial communities in\ngnotobiotic models. Finally, we will integrate our findings to establish a mechanistic model of irColitis compared\nto IBD, to propose novel stratifications of cancer immunotherapy patients by risk factors, and to offer future\ntherapeutic opportunities, such as actionable tissue genomic and protein targets or fecal transplants.	16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Address;Antibodies;Autoantibodies;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;CTLA4 blockade;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials Design;Colitis;Colorectal;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Crohn&apos;s disease;Data;Development;Disease remission;Dose;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Feces;Flowers;Future;Genetic;Genomics;Gnotobiotic;Goals;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immunohistochemistry;Immunologist;Immunotherapy;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Intestines;Knowledge;Lamina Propria;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical Oncologist;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibodies;Nature;Nivolumab;Patient risk;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Predictive Value;Progression-Free Survivals;Proteins;Proteomics;Risk Factors;Safety;Scientist;Serology;Serum;Serum Markers;Specialist;Specimen;Steroids;Stratification;Structure;Symptoms;TNF gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Treatment Side Effects;Ulcerative Colitis;anti-CTLA4;anti-PD-1;antimicrobial;bacterial community;base;cancer immunotherapy;clinical development;cytokine;density;fecal transplantation;frontier;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;immune checkpoint;immune checkpoint blockade;immune-related adverse events;improved;ipilimumab;melanoma;metagenomic sequencing;microbial;microbiome;microbiome analysis;microbiome composition;microbiome signature;novel;patient subsets;peripheral blood;predictive marker;prospective;response;serological marker;single cell analysis;single-cell RNA sequencing;targeted agent;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions	ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Jean-Frederic  Colombel,Jeremiah James Faith,Sacha  Gnjatic	DCB	Aynur  Unalp-Arida	577498	$500k to $749k	385790	5-Jul-2021	1-Jun-2020	31-May-2025	RFA-CA-19-044	Moonshot

Reasons for the greater burden of aggressive disease in AA men are unknown, but are\nlikely to include a multitude of factors including social factors such as lifetime stress, inherited susceptibility, and\ntumor-related features such as somatic alterations and local inflammation in the microenvironment. The\noverarching goal of this Program Project is to uncover the social and biological factors that are related to PCa\naggressiveness in AA men. To accomplish this objective, we will establish a large, national, population-based\ncohort study, RESPOND, (Research on Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry: Defining the Roles of\nGenetics, Immunity and Social Stress) of 10,000 AA men with incident PCa identified through nine SEER and\nNPCR U.S. cancer registries from states that include 38% of all AA PCa cases in the U.S.. The cohort will provide\ncomprehensive information on multilevel stressors over the lifecourse such as discrimination, early-life adversity,\nand neighborhood disorder, including geospatial neighborhood data over time and degree of perceived stress;\n2) lifestyle factors and health behaviors; 3) disease-specific factors including PSA screening history and\ntreatment choice; 4) germline DNA to study genetic susceptibility, and 5) tumor block samples for\ncharacterization of somatic variation and immune profiling of the tumor microenvironment. No previous study\nhas attempted to obtain information across these domains in a single large sample in order to understand the\nrelative contribution of each and relationships between molecular and non-genetic components. In order to\naddress these goals, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and clinicians with established\ntrack records in PCa research. Leveraging the RESPOND resource and investigator expertise, we have\ndesigned a Program Project composed of four Projects that are supported by four Cores which are all focused\non the central theme of identifying social and biological factors related to PCa disease aggressiveness in AA\nmen. These Projects include: the investigation of multilevel social stressors across the lifecourse in relationship\nwith aggressive PCa (Project 1); genome-wide discovery efforts of germline susceptibility loci for aggressive\nPCa and examination of the relationship between germline and somatic variation (Project 2); the identification\nof underlying somatic alterations in PCa tumors and biological pathways that are related to aggressive disease\n(Project 3); and, a detailed assessment of inflammation in the tumor microenvironment as it relates to PCa\naggressiveness in AA men (Project 4). Each of the four Projects address a distinct research domain, however,\nwhen studied together, create scientific synergy and a far more comprehensive picture of the major factors that\ncontribute to aggressive PCa in AA men. The information we will discover is likely to have immediate clinical\nimplications in the areas of improved patient stratification and personalized medicine. Hence, this study has\nbroad reaching significance and addresses numerous challenges in the clinical management of PCa in AA men.

The leading QA centers; RPC, QARC, RTOG QA, ITC, ACRIN and CALGB/SWOG Imaging Core lab, in the current NCI Cooperative Group Program have joined together to form the IROC Group, administratively organized through the American College of Radiology (ACR) Clinical Research Center. The creation of IROC capitalizes on existing infrastructure and expertise at QA Centers currently providing services to the NCI Cooperative Groups. Work flows, processes and information systems currently in place will be further enhanced taking the best practices and standards in an integrated vision. The interdependencies between imaging and RT will be synergized in this QA Group eliminating duplication of services and optimizing towards efficient and effective workflows. A major strength of IROC will be the development of consistent standard operating procedures for all imaging and RT aspects of the NCTN and to facilitate a seamless flow of imaging and RT patient case datasets across the network. IROC's organizational structure allows the delivery of a broad array of imaging and RT QA services including Site Qualification; Trial Design Support; Credentialing; Data Management (Pre- and Post- Review); and Case Review. An information technology infrastructure will be developed that harmonizes IROC services, data collection, assessment and management for the NCTN Groups' clinical trials. IROC will implement programs that assure consistent high quality imaging and RT planning/delivery across the NCTN participating sites. IROC members will collaborate with the NCTN disease/modality committees within each Network Group to provide an optimal and effective imaging and RT core service. IROC will analyze QA data obtained prospectively/retrospectively to further advance QA science. IROC will manage all aspects of QA for NCTN trials that includes imaging and/or RT with the shared goal to achieve the best possible trial outcomes.

This platform will play an essential role in supporting studies of tumor initiation, development, heterogeneity, invasion, and metastasis. These tools will allow quantitative analyses of the interplay between morphology and spatially mapped genetics and molecular data and will be used in studies that predict outcome and response to treatment, in radiogenomic and quantitative radiology imaging studies and in studies to identify cancer targets. The software and methods will enable researchers to assemble and visualize detailed, multi-scale descriptions of tissue morphologic changes originating from a wide range of microscopy instruments and make it possible to efficiently manage, interrogate, and explore microscopy imaging data at multiple scales and to identify and analyze features across individuals and cohorts. The project will build on and extend the software and methods we have developed in microscopy imaging, integrative image analysis, high performance computing, databases, and visualization over the past fifteen years and will also leverage, integrate and adapt the Harvard Slicer platform. The design and implementation of the informatics platform will be driven by four well funded, leading edge cancer focused studies along with many additional collaborative efforts including the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), the Mayo Clinic Quantitative Imaging Network site, the Colon Cancer Family Registry and the Polyp Prevention Study.	3-Dimensional;Anatomy;Automobile Driving;Biomedical Research;Brain Neoplasms;Cancer Research Project;Clinic;Cloud Computing;Collaborations;Communities;Complex;Computer Simulation;Computer software;Data;Data Analytics;Databases;Department of Energy;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Distant;Doctor of Philosophy;Educational workshop;Foundations;Funding;Genetic;Genomics;Grant;Heterogeneity;High Performance Computing;Image;Image Analysis;Imagery;Individual;Informatics;Institution;Laboratories;Lead;Leadership;Letters;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Maps;Medical Imaging;Methods;Microscopic;Microscopy;Molecular;Morphology;National Cancer Institute;National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering;Neoplasm Metastasis;Ohio;Pathology;Pattern;Performance;Play;Polyps;Positioning Attribute;Prevention;Principal Investigator;Proteomics;Radiogenomics;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resolution;Resource Sharing;Role;Running;Science;Shotguns;Site;Slide;Structure;System;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Three-Dimensional Image;Time;Tissue Sample;Tissue imaging;Tissues;Training;United States National Library of Medicine;Universities;Work;analytical method;anticancer research;cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid;cancer cell;cancer clinical trial;cancer imaging;cohort;colon cancer family registry;design;digital;experience;image archival system;imaging modality;imaging study;in vivo imaging;innovation;instrument;laser capture microdissection;melanoma;method development;microscopic imaging;middleware;next generation;novel therapeutics;online resource;open source;outcome prediction;predicting response;programs;protein expression;public health relevance;quantitative imaging;radiological imaging;reconstruction;research and development;sialodacryoadenitis virus;tool;tool development;treatment response;tumor;tumor initiation	STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK	STONY BROOK	NY	UNITED STATES	Joel H.

project	5U24CA180996-05	U24CA180996	9334747	2017	Cancer Genomics:Integrative and Scalable Solutions in R / Bioconductor	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal develops scalable R / Bioconductor software infrastructure and data resources to integrate complex, heterogeneous, and large cancer genomic experiments. The falling cost of genomic assays facilitates collection of multiple data types (e.g., gene and transcript expression, structural variation, copy number, methylation, and microRNA data) from a set of clinical specimens. Furthermore, substantial resources are now available from large consortium activities like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Existing analysis pipelines focus on the treatment of a specific data type, leaving a critical need for tool for integrative analysis of multiple genomic assays for locally generated or publicly available data. R / Bioconductor has historically provided standardized genomic data structures and annotations that have enjoyed widespread adoption in the cancer genomics research community. This proposal adapts R / Bioconductor to meet the increasing conceptual and computational complexity of multi-assay cancer genomic experiments. We begin by developing software containers for coordinated representation, manipulation, and transformation of heterogeneous derived data from multiple cancer genomic assays. These containers are then extended to manage very large primary data resources. To facilitate integration of local experimental results with major public cancer genomics experiment data sets and annotations, we re-package public resources and provide software and cloud-based facilities for easy and fast programmatic access from within R/Bioconductor. This greatly simplifies cancer genomic analysis tasks that otherwise require significant, error-prone individual efforts. Finally, we provide software infrastructure to enable high-throughput computation using parallel and iterative approaches. The ability to manipulate multi-assay cancer genomic experiments, to understand individual experimental results in the context of public experiments and annotations, and facilities for improved high-throughput computational performance in a well-established computing environment greatly enhances opportunities for analysis and comprehension of large multi-assay cancer genomic experiments.

This software ecosystem is supported by core\ndata classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and\nefficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell\nassays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of\nDNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a\nsingle specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the\ndata. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to\nmeet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of\nsingle-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant\nprioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of\nexperimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create\nprovenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in\nprioritization. Third, we develop scalable infrastructure for the curation, distribution, maintenance,\ndiscoverability, and usability of cancer data resources within and externally to Bioconductor. Finally, we\ndevelop a program of user training and new outreach approaches to support adoption of advanced\nBioconductor infrastructure by developers of new cancer-related packages and existing packages critical to the\ncancer research community.

project	5U24CA194215-02	U24CA194215	9331533	2017	Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data\nsuch as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities.

It's open and flexible environment enables interoperation of diverse bioinformatics software via a user-friendly web-based interface. Despite its proven value for genomic bioinformatics, Galaxy's potential for enabling cancer research has not been fully realized. One area of emerging potential for Galaxy is multi- omic informatics. Multi-omics integrates high throughput genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomics data to reveal new molecular discoveries in cancer. For example, integrating metabolomics information with genomic and/or proteomic data reveals biochemical consequences of gene and protein variations underlying carcinogenesis. Integration of genomic or transcriptomic data with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic data (proteogenomics) identifies novel protein variants linked to genome mutations. Integration of metagenomic data with MS-based proteomic data (metaproteomics) identifies proteins expressed by microbial communities giving insights into biochemical contributions from the microbiome to carcinogenesis. Despite their potential pay-off, these multi-omic approaches require use of diverse informatics tools out of the reach of most bench researchers. Fortunately, Galaxy offers a solution. We propose to extend Galaxy and create a powerful, unified hub for multi-omic informatics. We will focus on enhancing Galaxy with a stand-alone Multi-omics Visualization Platform (MVP) for results visualization and interpretation. We will build novel Galaxy extensions enabling metabolite profiling, results interpretation and targeted clinical validation studies. We will extend current Galaxy-based tools to create a complete solution for proteogenomic and metaproteomic informatics, making easy-to-build workflows that ensure accurate results. Finally, we will empower cancer researchers to use Galaxy for multi-omics in their work via a variety of dissemination and training activities. We will achieve these outcomes via these Specific Aims: 1) Extend a Galaxy-compatible Multi-omics Visualization Platform (MVP) for enhanced results interpretation and data exchange utilizing cancer knowledge bases and informatics resources; 2) Extend Galaxy and the MVP tool for metabolite profiling in cancer research; 3) Extend Galaxy and the MVP tool for integrative genomic-proteomic informatics and workflows.; 4) Catalyze the use of multi-omic workflows and associated tools by cancer researchers via dissemination, promotion and training activities. Our work will be guided via driving cancer projects with a network of collaborators. We will partner with developers of established software and methods in different 'omic domains, and utilize world-class infrastructure at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. Our deliverables will directly complement other projects currently funded through the NIH ITCR program. The upshot of our work will be a large network of cancer researchers empowered to utilize high impact, multi-omic approaches, ultimately catalyzing new discoveries that will help decrease the suffering and death from cancer.

MD Anderson Cancer Center has been a leader in the\nimplementation of this antibody-based technology that can assess many protein markers across large numbers\nof samples in a cost-effective, sensitive and high-throughput manner. The platform currently assesses ~300\nprotein markers, covering all major signaling pathways and most drug targets. Its utility was demonstrated\nthrough its selection as the sole platform for characterizing >10,000 patient samples through The Cancer\nGenome Atlas (TCGA); and recently it has been designated as one of two NCI Genome Characterization\nCenters, and will characterize up to ~10,000 samples from ongoing NCI initiatives and other consortium\nprojects. For TCGA project, the applicants built The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), a web platform for\nvisualizing and analyzing RPPA data, which has a community of >5,000 users worldwide. The long-term goal\nis to promote the ability of functional proteomics to impact cancer research and the development of relevant\ntherapeutic strategies. The current objective is to expand the scope of TCPA by adding new functionalities and\ndatasets, and to enhance and improve its existing analytic capabilities. Working relationships have been\nformed to link TCPA with other widely used bioinformatic resources (e.g., cBio, UCSC Genome Browsers,\nFirehose and Synpase) and other ITCR projects. An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled\nto pursue four specific aims: Aim #1. Develop an open source, all-in-one software package for processing\nRPPA data. This effort will standardize each informatic step for RPPA data generation including experimental\ndesign, quality control, and data normalization. The resultant program will be exported to other RPPA facilities.\nAim #2. Expand and enhance our existing web platform for the analysis of patient-cohort RPPA data. The web\nplatform will cover other patient cohorts, incorporate other types of molecular/clinical data, and provide\npathway/network-based analytics. Aim #3. Build a user-friendly, interactive, open web platform for the analysis\nof cell line RPPA data. This effort will collect and compile RPPA data of >1,500 cell lines, and develop a web\nplatform parallel to Aim #2. Aim #4. Promote TCPA and active interaction with the user community. This effort\nwill provide documentation, hands-on workshops, and bug fixes, and build web APIs for interaction with other\ntools. The expected outcome is the first, dedicated bioinformatic resource that fully integrates RPPA data\ngeneration, analysis and user feedback, allowing for fluent exploration and analysis of high-quality proteomic\ndata in a rich context. The project is important because it will greatly enhance the quality and reproducibility of\nRPPA data from important consortium projects; substantially reduce barriers biomedical researchers face in\nmining complex functional proteomic data; serve as a hub for integrating proteomic data into other widely used\nbioinformatic resources; and directly facilitate development of protein markers for precision cancer medicine.

We have assembled an outstanding team of basic and clinical scientists to discover and confirm proteins\nand protein modifications associated with cancer progression using genoproteomic approaches. This\nmultidisciplinary team will be managed by the same three Principal Investigators (PI) and consists of\ninternationally recognized experts in proteomic technologies, genomics, proteogenomics-specific bioinformatics,\nbiostatistics, oncology, pathology, cancer biology, assay development, quality control, technology optimization,\nand clinical laboratory science/clinical chemistry. Our team has complementary and integrated expertise with\nprevious and ongoing successful collaborations. The plan is to integrate the genomics findings with proteomic\nanalysis (genoproteomics) and to overcome the caveats and challenges in the comprehensive understanding of\ntumor biology. We believe that genomic data provides a highly valuable molecular route towards the identification\nof genes and pathways that could be useful for the detection, differential diagnosis, outcome prediction and\ntherapeutic targets of cancer. The proteomic approaches will provide the identification of unique features that\nare inherent to proteins including post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation.\nWe propose to use the technology platform validated during the current CPTAC which is high throughput, robust\nand state of the art. These technologies are proven, with the capability of generating reproducible results across\nlabs. We will use a two-step strategy to characterize defined sets of genomically-characterized samples. The\nfirst step is the discovery of target proteins from both biological and clinical specimens using mass spectrometry\nand affinity based technologies. The second step is the confirmation of these targets using high-throughput,\nCPTAC Tier 2 analytically validated targeted assays, for example, Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass\nSpectrometry (MRM-MS). In addition, we propose to develop pilot studies for technology improvement. The goal\nis to generate accurate, reproducible, sensitive, quantitative, and multiplexed assays using optimized and\nstandardized high-throughput technologies for the discovered targets. While this PCC application is focused on\nthe proteomic characterization of biological and clinical specimens, we believe that the understanding of and\nexpertise in proteogenomic data analysis and translation will be critical for the success of the PCC and the overall\nCPTAC network. Investigators/PIs from our proposed PCC will be part of applications for the CPTAC\nProteogenomic Data Analysis (PGDAC) and Translational Research (PTCR) Centers. Collaboration and team\nwork are key to the success of the CPTAC program. With this multidisciplinary team of outstanding basic and\nclinical scientists, our PCC offers the best opportunity for the successful characterization of biological and clinical\nspecimens to discover and confirm cancer targets to advance precision cancer medicine.

We believe that genomic data provides a highly valuable molecular route towards the identification\nof genes and pathways that could be useful for the detection, differential diagnosis, outcome prediction and\ntherapeutic targets of cancer. The proteomic approaches will provide the identification of unique features that\nare inherent to proteins including post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation.\nWe propose to use the technology platform validated during the current CPTAC which is high throughput, robust\nand state of the art. These technologies are proven, with the capability of generating reproducible results across\nlabs. We will use a two-step strategy to characterize defined sets of genomically-characterized samples. The\nfirst step is the discovery of target proteins from both biological and clinical specimens using mass spectrometry\nand affinity based technologies. The second step is the confirmation of these targets using high-throughput,\nCPTAC Tier 2 analytically validated targeted assays, for example, Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass\nSpectrometry (MRM-MS). In addition, we propose to develop pilot studies for technology improvement. The goal\nis to generate accurate, reproducible, sensitive, quantitative, and multiplexed assays using optimized and\nstandardized high-throughput technologies for the discovered targets. While this PCC application is focused on\nthe proteomic characterization of biological and clinical specimens, we believe that the understanding of and\nexpertise in proteogenomic data analysis and translation will be critical for the success of the PCC and the overall\nCPTAC network. Investigators/PIs from our proposed PCC will be part of applications for the CPTAC\nProteogenomic Data Analysis (PGDAC) and Translational Research (PTCR) Centers.

project	5U24CA224020-03	U24CA224020	10254377	2021	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC)	Grant	ABSTRACT\nIn contrast to the decline in mortality in other cancers, the incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n(PDAC) is increasing, and therapeutic approaches, for the most part, have not been successful at improving\nsurvival in patients. Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers,\ncomparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an\nimmune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune\nbarriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease.\nThe U01 “Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME” was created through the National Cancer\nMoonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC,\nespecially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24\nRFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal\nAdenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio\nWistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center\n(UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with\nrespect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental\ntherapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics),\nAndy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton\n(co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple\nareas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01\nawardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage\ncapabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing\ntranslationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support\nadministrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and\naccess to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will\nserve as the central “hub” for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we\nwill utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be\nreadily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics\nservices for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and\ndevelop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well\nas provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be\nan indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.

However, results from individual\nresearch groups have been difficult to validate due to the lack of standardized PDX procedures, lack of scale\nfor adequately powered PDX studies and the inability to efficiently share PDX specimens. A key contributor to\nthis challenge is the lack of well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of\nintegrated, standardized datasets from PDX models. The JAX-Seven Bridges PDX Data Commons and\nCoordination Center (PDCCC) seeks to address this challenge and unite the efforts of the component data-\ngenerating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI’s Patient-Derived\nModel Repository/PDMR) parts of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research Network (PDXNet) into\na cohesive, trans-Network whole. Using innovative cloud computing and bioinformatic approaches, our\nPDCCC will provide administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX method\nstandardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. We will build a data storage,\nsharing, and analysis platform that harmonizes PDXNet data with other large datasets and analysis workflows\navailable in the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud. Simultaneously, we will administer planning meetings, training\nactivities, and research pilots to build synergies within the PDXNet, enhancing the ability of the PDXNet to\ndevelop clinical trials from PDX studies. Our Specific Aims are to 1) establish a leadership and\nadministration unit to manage and coordinate activities within PDXNet, including annual meetings,\nregular conference calls, training activities, trans-Network pilot projects, and outreach; 2) develop a cloud-\nintegrated PDXnet Data Commons that integrates PDXNet data with the existing cloud-based data analysis\nplatform - the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC); and 3) build analysis workflows and data\nsharing practices to optimize PDXNet research and enable PDXNet data to facilitate clinical trial design. To\naccomplish these Aims we have assembled a team with unique expertise in PDXs, cancer treatment, genomic\nanalysis, data coordination, and project management from The Jackson Laboratory and Seven Bridges. Our\ncombined institutional strengths include a history of leadership in (and commitment) to PDX, data resource,\nanalytic and consensus standards development and application; practical expertise in PDX model sharing and\ncollaborative community efforts; a broad array of statistical, bioinformatic, and software-related PDX resources;\nleadership expertise in large-scale, cloud-based biomedical data projects, notably the SB-CGC; and deep\nexperience in high-performance database engineering and development. Our goal is to build an innovative,\nsystematically organized PDCCC that will advance the efforts of PDXNet to improve the validity—and expand\nuse—of the PDX system as a preclinical platform for precision oncology.

project	5U24CA224122-03	U24CA224122	10255532	2021	Coordinating Center for Canine Immunotherapy Trials and Correlative Studies	Grant	The primary mission of goal of the Pre-medical Cancer Immunotherapy Network for Canine Trials (PRECINCT) is to facilitate the performance of immunotherapy clinical trials in dogs with cancer and to expedite the identification of\nimmunological correlates of successful therapeutic responses. The PRECINCT will achieve these goal by supporting a highly coordinated clinical trials network of participating U01 sites. As a coordinating center, the PRECINCT will work in consultation with U01 investigators, the Steering Committee, representatives from the Comparative Oncology Program (COP) at NCI and an External Advisory Committee to provide expert services in project management and research technology, data management, biostatistical support and immunological monitoring.\nSpecifically, we will establish a PRECINCT Data Coordinating Center to provide comprehensive project oversight,\nsupervise all project management and regulatory compliance activities, and coordinate site management for all\naspects of single and large multi-site projects. Through the PRECINCT, U01 investigators will have ready access to research services and standardized protocols that will facilitate the performance of clinical research across the\nPRECINCT. We will establish a PRECINCT Data Management System to collect, store and share all clinical and\ncorrelative data amongst the U01 sites and with the COP directors and Steering Committee. We will develop the\ninfrastructure necessary to achieve an efficient, highly functioning coordinated network and develop standard\noperating procedures (SOPs) that can be applied across all PRECINCT-associated U01 projects to ensure high\nquality, repeatable data sets. We will provide biostatistical support for study design and data analysis to ensure\nthat immunotherapy clinical trials performed within the network are strategically designed and appropriately\npowered to achieve meaningful clinical and laboratory data results in the most expedite way. The renowned\nexpertise of the University of Pennsylvania in both human and canine clinical trials will foster rapid translation of\nstate-of-the art methods for human clinical study design and analysis to canine clinical trials and results from\ncanine trials can rapidly inform human clinical trials, thus optimizing results for both species. Finally, the University\nof Pennsylvania is a leader in cancer immunotherapy and is also home to world renowned experts in immune\nreagent development and immunological monitoring. We will leverage this expertise to both accelerate the\nmission of the U24 and extend it by providing support for immunologic reagent development for use in correlative\nstudies and biomarker identification. In concert with U01 investigators, the COP and the Steering Committee, we\nwill design, generate and validate several multiparametric, multicolor flow panels and SOPs for their use across the\nU01 sites. Successful immunologic monitoring will allow canine cancer patients to be streamlined to single or\ncombination therapies most likely to be effective and will provide essential insight for future translational\napplication to human cancer patients.

Cancer genomics has\ncontributed to many advances in treating several cancers, but the field is limited by a lack of genomics data. The\nParticipant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network will promote and support\nresearch on direct participant engagement approaches to address these gaps, especially among rare cancers,\nhighly lethal cancers, cancers with an early age of onset, cancers with high disparities in incidence/mortality, and\ncancers among under-represented minorities.\n Our team wishes to contribute to the important work of the (PE-CGS) Network by serving as its\ncoordinating center. We have the necessary faculty, resources, and experience to address the needs and\ngoals of the Network by supporting network coordination, promoting effective and equitable outreach and\npromotion, and establishing and disseminating network best practices. In addition to meeting all the requirements\nof the RFA, we bring innovation by establishing Participant Engagement Community (PEC) by applying the\nprinciples of community-based participatory research and by promoting a diverse pool of future scientists,\nespecially those from underrepresented groups through a Summer Scholar Program and by two post-doctoral\npositions that will be supported by our comprehensive cancer center.\n Our proposal for the coordinating center is focused around four specific aims. First, we will effectively\nmanage administrative and scientific coordination of the PE-CGS network. This will include providing\nadministration/coordination, governing all advisory, organizing meetings/site visits, fostering collaboration,\ndissemination and implementation, and coordinating communication. Second, we will foster effective and\nculturally appropriate outreach and promotion activities. We will establish a common branded, public relations,\ncommunication resources, facilitating interactions, and managing outreach. Third, we will develop and\ndisseminate network best practices and data collection/processing standards. We provide support for participant\nengagement and cancer genome sequencing activities, establish data standards, ensure data are accessible to\nthe public, data are appropriately shared, and support efforts to make the Network sustainable. Finally, we want\nto address health disparities and promote equity throughout the Network and ensure there is a diverse pool of\nfuture scientists, including those from underrepresented groups, to support future efforts in participant\nengagement and cancer genomics. We envision that the network will need to evolve to address emerging issues\nin participant engagement and believe that being based in a university setting will provide us the capacity to\nanticipate and address these issues as they emerge. We are strongly supported by the OSU College of Medicine,\nthe OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the OSU Center for Clinical and Translational Science.

However, the fundamental mechanisms driving resistance\nremain largely unknown. Tumors are comprised of a complex multicellular ecosystem of malignant and non-\nmalignant cells, and changes in their composition, states, spatial organization and interactions are central to\ntherapeutic resistance. Thus, there is an enormous need to chart an atlas of a tumor's cells, their spatial\norganization and interactions as those change dynamically in resistance to therapy. Technological\nbreakthroughs in spatial and single-cell genomics, including many innovations by our team, now put an atlas\nwithin reach, but harnessing this remarkable opportunity, requires collection of multiple spatial and single cell\ngenomics data in clinical samples; novel study design strategies; new experimental and computational strategies\nto integrate across cellular and spatial data; algorithms to construct tumor atlases that capture the resistant state;\nand showing how to use an atlas to formulate and test new predictive models of resistance. The Boston Human\nTumor Atlas Network Research Center (HTA-RC) will address each of these challenges by creating three\ncomprehensive atlases of the cellular geography of human cancer to understand how changes in the\ntumor ecosystem lead to therapeutic resistance in: (1) Primary and acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition\nin breast cancer; (2) Primary and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic melanoma;\nand (3) Primary resistance to immunotherapy in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinoma (CRC)\ncompared with microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC. All three tumors types tackle an unmet clinical need; have an\napproximately equal rate of resistance and response to allow comparisons between states; and harness\nsignificant clinical experience and build on substantial preliminary results at our center. To construct the atlases,\nwe will collect at least 100 biospecimens per year from resections and biopsies of the three tumor types and\nanalyze them with histopathological data, high-resolution spatial multiplex RNA and protein data, single-\ncell genomics data, and temporal clinical data. Our algorithms will recover key features of each data modality,\nand integrate them into a single atlas to determine what predicts and underlies resistance. We build on a\nwell-established interdisciplinary team in two major cancer centers (DFCI, MGH) and four research\ninstitutions (Broad, Harvard, Stanford, Princeton). Our leadership (Haining, Regev) and Units comprise of\nforemost experts and pioneers in clinical genomics (Biospecimens; Johnson, Wagle), spatial and single cell\ngenomics (Shalek, Rozenblatt-Rosen, Nolan, Zhuang), and computational biology and data science (Regev,\nVan Allen, Engelhardt).

project	5U2CCA233280-02	U2CCA233280	9788351	2019	Omic and Multidimensional Spatial Atlas of Metastatic Breast and Prostate Cancers	Grant	ABSTRACT - Overall\nWe propose to create an Omic and Multidimensional Spatial (OMS) Atlas that will enable discovery of\nmechanisms of resistance that arise in individual patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancer during\ntreatment with current generation targeted therapeutic combinations and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The\nOMS Atlas is motivated by the fact that these treatments typically are only transiently effective in the metastatic\nsetting. Possible resistance mechanisms may be intrinsic to the tumor cells or derive from the diverse\nmicroenvironments in which the tumor cells live. The OMS Atlas will focus on elucidating these resistance\nmechanisms in three specific current generation clinical scenarios: (a) hormone-receptor positive breast cancer\n(HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, (b) triple negative\nbreast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and (c)\ncastration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) undergoing treatment with enzalutamide. We will accomplish this\nthrough work in four areas. A Biospecimen Unit will prospectively collect, manage, and distribute longitudinal\nclinical information, blood, and biopsies from 20 patients from each of two metastatic breast cancer cohorts and\none prostate cancer cohort that will be analyzed to create three OMS Atlases. The biopsies will be preserved to\nenable analyses using multiple characterization modalities. A Characterization Unit will analyze (a) OCT frozen\nspecimens using Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) and Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing ATAC-\nseq (sci-ATAC-seq) to elucidate spatially defined genomic changes and chromatin accessibility in single cells,\n(b) formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to\nassess the immune microenvironment and cyclic Immunofluorescence (cycIF) to assess the composition and\nmolecular states of tumor cells and their microenvironments, and (c) paraformaldehyde fixed, resin embedded\n(PFRE) specimens using a Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM) to identify\nultrastructural changes in 2D images and targeted 3D images with 4-nm resolution. Omic characterization of the\nsame tumor samples will be provided by the SMMART Program. A Data Analysis Unit will develop and deploy\ntools to (a) manage, analyze, and visualize Tier 1 data comprised of raw sequence data and images to generate\nunimodal Tier 2 results, (b) integrate omics and imaging data through crosswise mapping to create single\ntimepoint tumor maps and quantify systems biological functions of tumor cellular subpopulations to generate Tier\n3 results, and (c) explore differences between pre- and on/post-treatment tumor maps to reveal mechanisms of\nresistance that comprise Tier 4 results. We will collaborate with private sector partners to evaluate and adopt\nnext generation technologies that increase analytical power and speed and reduce costs.

project	5U2CCA233285-02	U2CCA233285	9791161	2019	Center for pediatric tumor cell atlas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL\nChildhood Cancer is the second most common causes of childhood deaths. Cancers in children are highly\ndistinct from those in adults. Causes, mechanisms and therapeutic approaches cannot be extrapolated from\nthe study of adult malignancies. To impact the burden of pediatric cancers requires the specific study of\npediatric cancers. We therefore propose the in depth characterization of three specific subtypes of pediatric\nmalignancies which, together, account for over 50% of all pediatric cancer deaths: high grade glioma (pHGG),\nhigh risk neuroblastoma (NB), and very high risk acute lymphoblastic B-cell precursor leukemia (VHR-ALL). All\nthree tumor types share a characteristic of typically initial response to therapy, followed by the emergence of\nresistance and refractory disease. We will map molecular and cellular changes in tumor cells,\nmicroenvironment and the immune system using comprehensive multi-dimensional single-cell and in situ\ntechnologies associated with two critical transitions: initial response, and emergence of resistant disease –\nboth high-priority transitions. Treatment modalities will include standard chemotherapy, molecular targeted\ntherapies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-) T cell therapy, capturing the cutting edge of current cancer\ntherapy. The final product will impact global childhood cancer research in the following manner: 1) Tumor\nAtlases: atlases will provide a highly user friendly, publicly available, searchable database of the most\ncomprehensive multi-omic, single cell analysis of the three most lethal childhood cancers. Molecular data will\nbe richly annotated with access to additional pathological evaluation, clinical and outcomes data, and grant\naccess to source data such tumor imaging. 2) Computational methods: in addition to the data, the critical\ncomputational tools and pipelines used in this project will be available to the research community. These\ninclude methods and pipelines for processing multi-omics and in situ data, inference of cancer phylogeny,\ninference of cell- and clone-specific pathways, methods for inferring cell-cell crosstalk, as well as database\nalgorithms for the query, exploration and visualization of highly complex data. 3) Access to biospecimens for\nfollow up studies: biospecimens collected in this project will be banked and made available to the biomedical\nresearch community. These include tissue sections, viably frozen specimen, and patient derived xenograft\n(PDX models). In summary, the proposed project will seek to address a major public health need in pediatrics,\nbroadly impact the entire research community, and jumpstart target discovery based on a sophisticated\nunderstanding of the key molecular circuits that drive pediatric cancer.

project	5U2CCA233285-04	U2CCA233285	10251223	2021	Center for pediatric tumor cell atlas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL\nChildhood Cancer is the second most common causes of childhood deaths. Cancers in children are highly\ndistinct from those in adults. Causes, mechanisms and therapeutic approaches cannot be extrapolated from\nthe study of adult malignancies. To impact the burden of pediatric cancers requires the specific study of\npediatric cancers. We therefore propose the in depth characterization of three specific subtypes of pediatric\nmalignancies which, together, account for over 50% of all pediatric cancer deaths: high grade glioma (pHGG),\nhigh risk neuroblastoma (NB), and very high risk acute lymphoblastic B-cell precursor leukemia (VHR-ALL). All\nthree tumor types share a characteristic of typically initial response to therapy, followed by the emergence of\nresistance and refractory disease. We will map molecular and cellular changes in tumor cells,\nmicroenvironment and the immune system using comprehensive multi-dimensional single-cell and in situ\ntechnologies associated with two critical transitions: initial response, and emergence of resistant disease –\nboth high-priority transitions. Treatment modalities will include standard chemotherapy, molecular targeted\ntherapies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-) T cell therapy, capturing the cutting edge of current cancer\ntherapy. The final product will impact global childhood cancer research in the following manner: 1) Tumor\nAtlases: atlases will provide a highly user friendly, publicly available, searchable database of the most\ncomprehensive multi-omic, single cell analysis of the three most lethal childhood cancers. Molecular data will\nbe richly annotated with access to additional pathological evaluation, clinical and outcomes data, and grant\naccess to source data such tumor imaging. 2) Computational methods: in addition to the data, the critical\ncomputational tools and pipelines used in this project will be available to the research community. These\ninclude methods and pipelines for processing multi-omics and in situ data, inference of cancer phylogeny,\ninference of cell- and clone-specific pathways, methods for inferring cell-cell crosstalk, as well as database\nalgorithms for the query, exploration and visualization of highly complex data. 3) Access to biospecimens for\nfollow up studies: biospecimens collected in this project will be banked and made available to the biomedical\nresearch community.

Physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the\nSiteman Cancer Center (WUSM-SCC) are longtime leaders in the allied sub-disciplines of cancer, including\ngenomics, proteomics, imaging, functional characterization, pathology, clinical trials, and clinical care. WUSM-\nSCC is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, which sees ~9,000 new cancer patients annually.\nBuilding on our expertise, established infrastructure, large patient population, and extraordinary institutional\ncommitment, we propose to develop the Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center (WU-\nHTARC) within the NIH Human Tumor Analysis Network (HTAN).\nWe will focus on generating organ-specific human tumor atlases for three high priority cancer types associated\nwith exceptionally poor prognosis: the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), glioblastoma (GBM), and\npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

In addition to standard\nhistopathological analyses, bulk DNA/RNA sequencing, proteomics, and clinical imaging, etc., we will conduct\ncutting-edge, comprehensive analyses, including single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), multiplexed\nimmunofluorescent protein localization (MxIF), mass cytometry/Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF) cellular\ncharacterization, metabolomics analysis, innovative imaging, and 3-D modeling.\nWe have established infrastructure covering the aforementioned areas, from specimen procurement\n(Biospecimen Unit), to multidisciplinary analyses modules (Characterization Unit), and to analysis pipelines\n(Data Analysis Unit). Data generated from this study will be valuable for revealing the clonal evolution of the\ntumor cells from longitudinally collected specimens and to reconstruct the tumor ecosystem involving non-\ncancer cells and acellular structures.

There has been a failure to improve survival rates or decrease\ntreatment-related morbidity in OS/LMS due to insufficient characterization of the genomic landscape, resulting\nin a lack of targeted therapeutic approaches, diagnostic methods, and preventive strategies. There is an urgent\nneed for a large, shared database of clinical and genomic data in OS and LMS. Yet, because of the rarity of\nthese tumor types as well as other challenges in patient recruitment and the genomic characterization of these\ntumors, to date it has been difficult to generate this data. The overarching goal of this proposal is to engage\nadult and pediatric participants with OS and LMS as partners to generate a shared database of clinical,\ngenomic, molecular, and patient-reported data. This should accelerate discoveries that drive novel treatment\nstrategies, new clinical trials, and new standards of care. The Count Me In PE-CGS U2C Research Center will\nleverage our experience in patient engagement, genome characterization, computational analysis, and\nbehavioral research to create and launch two patient-partnered projects to generate this clinicogenomic\ndata. We will build two websites with patients in the OS and LMS communities—the Osteosarcoma Project\n(OSproject) and the Leiomyosarcoma Project (LMSproject)—and consent 3,000 patients over the course of the\nstudy. We will collect medical records, patient-reported data, archival tumor tissue samples, and saliva and blood\nfor genomic analysis. We will generate clinically annotated genomic data from at least 750 tumor specimens,\n500 circulating tumor DNA specimens, and corresponding germline specimens and share the de-identified data\nwidely. At the same time, we will study and optimize the approach to patient engagement in cancer research,\nparticularly among rural and minority participants and participants across a range of literacy levels, ages, and\nstages in development. To accomplish these goals, we will build on a well-established interdisciplinary team from\nthe Broad Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with members who have pioneered these approaches. Our\nleadership (Wagle, Janeway) and Units are comprised of experts in patient-partnered cancer research (Wagle,\nPainter), sarcoma clinical and translational research (Janeway, George, Crompton, Raut), genome\ncharacterization, analysis, and clinical interpretation (Gabriel, Getz, Van Allen, Wagle, Janeway),\ncomputational biology/data science (Getz, Van Allen, Philippakis), and behavioral science (Mack, Rebbeck).\nOur Center will uncover the key clinicogenomic features of OS/LMS, integrate them into a single comprehensive\ndatabase with a goal of accelerating research and improving the lives of these patients. In doing so, we also\naim to present a general approach to patient-partnered research that can be disseminated broadly and applied\nto other tumors types and patient communities.

project	5U54CA209978-03	U54CA209978	9669900	2018	Combating Subclonal Evolution of Resistant Cancer Phenotypes	Grant	Overall abstract\nOur Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution) will develop\na suite of\nsystems-based methodologies to understand how genomic diversity, clonal evolution, and phenotypic change\n . To evaluate their potential for\ntranslation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these\nphenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from\nselection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and\nmodeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets.\nSelective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's\ntumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and\nphenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it\nis not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and\nhow they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other\nquestions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the\nchanges and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using\nour unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will\ntest in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes.\nOur Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in\naddition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of\nthe evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad\nmultisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical\ntargeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor\nheterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our\nmultidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical\nbiologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges.

However, it\nis not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and\nhow they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other\nquestions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the\nchanges and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using\nour unique patient cohorts.

Treatment strategies for AML have not changed in 30-40 years. Single-agent\ntargeted therapies based on AML genetics or microenvironmental disease features have been disappointing, at\nbest. The investigators on this DRSC Program, Drug Combinations to Circumvent Resistance (D2CR), have\ncollaborated for over a decade and have developed functional genomic pipelines for evaluation of primary AML\npatient samples that have collectively led to numerous discoveries with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.\nFor this Program, our long-term goals are to translate effective drug combinations that target tumor-\nintrinsic and microenvironmental pathways into the clinic for patients with AML. Our immediate goals\nare to prioritize the most relevant tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways for each AML\ndisease subset and establish sufficient preclinical data to facilitate immediate clinical investigation of\ndrug combinations. Based on the central hypothesis that drug combinations targeting tumor intrinsic\nand extrinsic features of AML biology will be essential to the development of more effective and\ndurable therapeutic strategies, we predict that the drug combinations established by this D2CR-DRSC\nProgram will substantially improve outcomes for patients with AML. To accomplish these goals, 3\nProjects are proposed: 1) What are the tumor-intrinsic genes and pathways that contribute to drug sensitivity\nand resistance? Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screens on parental and drug-resistant AML cells will be\nintegrated with computational analysis of the largest functional genomic AML cohort in the world. The result will\nnominate genes/pathways for validation on patient samples in gene-edited models and for drug combination\nstudies in Project 3. 2) What are the tumor-extrinsic pathways promoting tumor cell growth, drug resistance,\nand immune suppression? Inflammatory cytokine profiling of our large bank of AML patient samples will be\nconducted. Our bank of AML patient bone marrow stromal cells will also be accessed for studies of the reactive\nsignature of these stromal cells when exposed to specific drugs. Finally, high-parameter immunophenotyping\nand T-cell functional assays will be used to define the immune landscape with candidate drugs tested in an\nimmune-competent, spontaneous mouse model of AML. Candidate targets will be nominated for combination\nstudies with tumor-intrinsic targets. 3) What are the drug combinations that most effectively bridge tumor-\nintrinsic and microenvironmental biology to eliminate AML cells and circumvent resistance? Drug combinations\nfrom targets nominated in Project 1 and 2 will be tested ex vivo on primary AML patient samples and in vivo\nusing AML patient-derived xenografts. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a major\nimpact on our understanding of AML biology, with successful clinical translation of new, more effective drug\ncombination strategies.

project	5U54CA224065-03	U54CA224065	10009286	2020	University of Texas PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	SUMMARY\nOur overarching goal for the University Texas PDX Development and Trial Center (UTPDTC) is to optimize\npersonalized biomarker-based cancer therapy and identify effective targeted drugs based on the molecular\ncharacteristics of each tumor. Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly-\nannotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The\nprimary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single\nagents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs\nor combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets\nof tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused\non non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative\nbreast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other\nhistologies. Over the past 9 years, both University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDACC) and The University of\nUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) have established institution-wide efforts to generate\nnovel PDX models and perform preclinical testing. Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX\nmodels of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC,\nn=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases\nwhere there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics.

project	5U54CA224065-04	U54CA224065	10242641	2021	University of Texas PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	SUMMARY\nOur overarching goal for the University Texas PDX Development and Trial Center (UTPDTC) is to optimize\npersonalized biomarker-based cancer therapy and identify effective targeted drugs based on the molecular\ncharacteristics of each tumor. Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly-\nannotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The\nprimary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single\nagents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs\nor combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets\nof tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused\non non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative\nbreast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other\nhistologies. Over the past 9 years, both University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDACC) and The University of\nUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) have established institution-wide efforts to generate\nnovel PDX models and perform preclinical testing. Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX\nmodels of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC,\nn=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases\nwhere there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We have characterized many tumor subtypes in our existing\nPDXs and plan to characterize many more with the ultimate goal of developing drug combinations in defined\ntumor subsets in a context that can lead to clinical trials which will validate the experimental results. We plan to\nfocus on NCI-IND agents that are primarily used by the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network.

Due to the\nsize and complexity of this challenge, we believe a collaborative team approach is critical and have assembled\na team of drug resistance experts from three leading institutions (MGH, the Broad Institute, and MIT/Koch\nInstitute) with an exceptional track record of impactful discoveries in this field. We propose an integrated full-spectrum\ntranslational platform—including liquid biopsy, patient-derived tumor models, exome and\ntranscriptome sequencing of tumor tissue, rapid autopsy, functional genomic screens, innovative preclinical\nmouse models, and a high-throughput combination drug-screening platform covering the CTEP portfolio—to\naddress critical principles of drug resistance across several major cancer types—lung, melanoma and GI\ncancers, which impact a large percentage of cancer patients. Overall, these three projects will focus on the\ncommon theme of bypass resistance mechanisms, a critical ad frequent mechanism of therapeutic resistance\nthat can involve both genetic and adaptive resistance mechanisms that “bypass” the effects of therapy, and\nwhich can drive both intrinsic and acquired resistance. To maximize the potential impact on cancer patients we\nwill focus projects on three major tumor types—lung, melanoma and GI cancers—with each project integrating\nat least two tumor types. We will focus our projects on defining and overcoming key bypass resistance\nmechanisms to three of the most critical classes of cancer therapeutics: MAPK inhibitors, RTK inhibitors, and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors. While each project will focus on a specific therapy and at least two specific\ncancer types, we believe the overall program design can be readily applied to additional agents and\nmolecularly-defined cancers, such that the ultimate impact of this work will go beyond the specific studies\nproposed and will serve as a “blueprint” for critical discoveries related to drug resistance. We anticipate that\nthese efforts will define a new standard in our mechanistic understanding of bypass resistance mechanisms\nand will lead to novel opportunities to overcome them in the clinic.

In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens\nhave been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas.\nThese treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof-\nof-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will\nprogress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been\nshown to be effective in patients with a wild-type BRAF. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments\nthat prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are\neffective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies,\nover the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical,\nhistological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of >450 PDX models represents one of the\nlargest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately\nrecapituluates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also\nincludes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been\nmaintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a\nrobust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we\npropose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued\nexpansion of our robutst melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical\ngaps in this disease. Project 1 will characterize kinase inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the\nPI3K-AKT pathway in combination with approved targeted therapies in PDX models in treatment-naïve and drug-\nresistant BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanomas. Project 2 will characterize targeting the apoptotic machinery of cancer\ncells as a combinatorial approach with MAPK pathway inhibitors in PDX with and without BRAFV600E/K mutations,\nincluding in subsets with aberrancies in anti-apoptotic genes. Both Projects will utilize baseline characteristics of the\nPDX models to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to guide personalized patient selection for\nfuture clinical testing. In addition, tumors will be analyzed for treatment-induced effects that correlate with sensitivity\nto identified resistance mechanisms and potential new combinatorial strategies. Finally, markers identified in the\npreclinical models will be compared to parallel biomarker studies of metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in\nclinical trials utilizing the same agents. These studies will be supported by the PDX, Bioinformatics, and\nAdministrative Cores to ensure their success, along with a Pilot Project program to open new areas of investigation.\nTogether these studies will have high potential to translate into new personalized clinical trials for patients.

project	5U54CA224079-03	U54CA224079	10005184	2020	The MSKCC-UW/Fred Hutch Prostate Cancer Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center	Grant	OVERALL ABSTRACT\nThe lethal stage of metastatic prostate cancer, called castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), kills\n~26,000 men per year in the US. Despite remarkable improvements in survival with next generation AR\npathway inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, CRPC patients ultimately progress and die from\ntheir disease. Our understanding of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to AR therapy has increased\ndramatically in recent years, largely based on genomic landscape analyses of tumors from CRPC patients and\npreclinical studies of acquired resistance in patient-derived models (organoids, PDX). Much of this progress is\ndirectly linked to the members of this Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center (DRSC) team. A major\nmechanistic insight from these studies is the recognition of two categories of AR therapy resistance: one in\nwhich AR pathway signaling is restored and the other in which it remains inhibited. Underlying both categories\nare a heterogeneous set of resistance mechanisms, many of which were discovered by our DRSC team\nmembers. Importantly, we have shown that several of these resistance mechanisms can be targeted with\ncurrent clinical grade drugs. The overarching goal of this DRSC proposal is to evaluate these translational\nopportunities across a unique set of preclinical organoid and PDX models (again, discovered and developed by\nour DRSC team members) and to catalyze the initiation of clinical studies in patients most likely to benefit\nbased on appropriate biomarker profiles. We address this goal in three Projects. Project 1 focuses on\nresistance caused by restored AR pathway function, which occurs in over ~50% of CRPC patients, by targeting\nthe glucocorticoid receptor, which is upregulated and substitutes for AR, or by further inhibition of AR signaling\nusing drugs targeting specific components of the chromatin machinery. Project 2 will take a similar approach\nbut will focus on the opposite category of acquired resistance (absence of restored AR pathway activity),\nleveraging insights from our recent data showing that cancer can revert from an AR-negative to AR-positive\nstate by targeting specific chromatin modifiers. Project 3 integrates with Projects 1 and 2 by focusing on\nkinase inhibitors as an adjunct to AR pathway therapy in two distinct contexts – PI3K/AKT activation in tumors\nwith PTEN loss and FGFR activation in tumors with autocrine FGF8/FGF9 production. Excitingly, a recent\nclinical trial of combined AKT and AR inhibition, which was initiated based on our earlier work, demonstrated a\nsignificant improvement in survival for patients with PTEN loss prostate cancer. The Administrative Core will\noversee the integration of the Projects with each other, with NCI scientific staff and with other DRSCs.\nCollectively our studies will validate various combination therapy regimens, in conjunction with molecular\nbiomarkers for patient selection, as a critical step toward clinical translation. In addition, the drugs and targets\nstudied here are broadly relevant for multiple cancer types.

Despite remarkable improvements in survival with next generation AR\npathway inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, CRPC patients ultimately progress and die from\ntheir disease. Our understanding of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to AR therapy has increased\ndramatically in recent years, largely based on genomic landscape analyses of tumors from CRPC patients and\npreclinical studies of acquired resistance in patient-derived models (organoids, PDX). Much of this progress is\ndirectly linked to the members of this Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center (DRSC) team.

This translational approach will be part of the NCI's Drug\nResistance and Sensitivity Centers Network to develop innovative strategies to understand and combat\nmechanisms of tumor resistance and exploit tumor sensitivity to anti-cancer therapies.\n To accomplish this, BATAR-UP will support two projects and one core driven by a multidisciplinary\nteam of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University. Project 1 will define and interrogate the molecular and\ncellular basis of residual disease in lung cancers treated with targeted inhibitors in clinical use. We will prioritize\nfor initial study both EGFR-mutant and ALK gene rearrangement positive lung cancers, given their importance\nas key molecular disease subtypes and our prior published work and expertise. We will harness genetic and\ntranscriptomic analysis of clinical samples (liquid and tumor biopsies) to provide a molecular view of the\nevolution of response, residual disease, and acquired resistance. We will generate organoid and PDX models\nand apply cutting-edge functional screens (genetic, pharmacologic, and targeted proteomic assays) to identify\nkey vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited, including with CTEP agents. This systematic\napproach will allow us to reveal the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that drives EGFR\nand ALK inhibitor resistance and pinpoint therapeutic strategies to intercept the evolution of residual disease\nand eventual acquired resistance. Project 2 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of\nresistance and residual disease in lung cancers treated with current immunotherapies, including PD-1 and PD-\nL1 antibodies. Leveraging shared platforms in synergy with Project 1, we will perform systematic analyses of\nliquid and tumor biopsy specimens (and ex vivo models) obtained from patients longitudinally before and\nduring treatment and upon acquired resistance. We will focus our studies on EGFR and ALK wild type patients,\nincluding squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma patients where immunotherapy has shown efficacy\nbut is typically non-curative.

Among patients with NF1, loss of\nthe non-mutant allele of NF1 in a rare Schwann cell or precursor, along with other ill-defined factors, leads to\nbenign dermal or plexiform neurofibromas. The main cause of death among NF1 patients is the malignant\nperipheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most likely develops\nfrom plexiform neurofibroma, in particular the so-called “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma. Approximately half of\nMPNSTs are NF1-associated, and NF1 patients have 10-15% lifetime risk of developing this terrible cancer.\nMPNSTs metastasize early and are often resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main treatment for\nMPNSTs is surgical resection but, despite radical excision with wide surgical margins, followed by\nchemoradiation, 5-year survival rates are poor due to metastases as well as local recurrence. NF1 patients\ncould greatly benefit from prophylactic vaccination that would prevent the malignant transformation of benign\nplexiform neurofibromas into “atypical” plexiform neurofibromas and to MPNSTs. We aim to determine if the\nmutations that govern the development of “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma (NF1 loss followed by CDKN2A\nloss) and MPSNT (NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12 loss) lead to the expression of recurrent alternately processed\ntranscripts, such as transcriptionally-induced chimeras, that could express neoantigens and be used as targets\nfor prophylactic vaccines. Such transcripts can be translated to produce novel peptides downstream of\nframeshift mutations caused by coding exon read-through into introns, mis-splicing from a coding exon to a\nnon-canonical splice acceptors or splice acceptors in other genes. In most cases, a premature termination\ncodon (PTC) will be rapidly encountered by the ribosome translating such transcripts. Therefore, we\nfurthermore hypothesize that these alternately processed transcripts can express what we call “cryptic”\nneoantigens when treated with drugs that suppress utilization of premature codons such as Ataluren or\ngentamycin.

project	5UG3CA244697-02	UG3CA244697	10024065	2020	Intercepting progression from pre-invasive to invasive lung adenocarcinoma	Grant	Abstract\nDespite advances in therapeutic strategies, non-small cell lung cancer remains a deadly disease. An\nimproved understanding of the biology of lung cancer is needed to intercept the disease at an early point in\nits progression. Our project, which is inspired by that challenge, focuses on events transpiring in the earliest\nradiographically-detected manifestation of lung cancer: the computerized tomography (CT)-detected non-\nsolid nodule, of which as many as 40% harbor frankly invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, despite conventional\nwisdom that CT-detected non-solid nodules represent pre or minimally invasive malignancy, clearly transition\nto more invasive histologies occurs in a significant proportion of these nodules.\nUnderstanding the cellular and molecular changes within non-solid nodules that drive progression will provide\nunique and novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that\nalterations in cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a role in initiating and supporting this\nprogression. In agreement with that proposal, our preliminary multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) studies\nsuggest that progression to a more invasive phenotype is associated with the development of a strong\nimmunosuppressive TME. In this project we test our hypothesis using multidimensional methods to profile the\nTME and to determine the crosstalk between cancer cells and the TME in pre-invasive to invasive human\nlung non-solid adenocarcinomas. Comparative analysis of the cellular and molecular events associated with\nthe distinct histological stages will lead to identification of the critical events triggering progression and\nthereby identify targets to intercept disease progression. We will use appropriate mouse models in pre-clinical\nstudies to develop these targets as strategies to intercept progression of pre-invasive to invasive cancer.\nIn the first phase of these studies (UG3 phase), we will define TME alterations associated with progression of\nlung nodules using RNAseq profiling and image-based methods (multiplex IF and imaging CyTOF) in studies\nof our archival tumor samples. These studies will generate a comprehensive catalogue of the cellular and\nmolecular events that trigger progression of indolent lesions to frankly invasive cancers, with a strong focus\non immune mechanisms. These analyses will provide novel and detailed insights into how the composition\nand activity of the TME changes with progression. In the second phase (UH3 phase), we will leverage mouse\nmodels to explore interception strategies to target immune mechanisms and prevent progression.\nThe proposed cohort satisfies the RFA’s focus on High-Risk Cohorts for Cancer-Immunoprevention Studies,\nsince lung nodules are premalignancies highly prevalent in smokers.

project	5UH3CA202663-04	UH3CA202663	9790952	2019	Cytology-Free POC Cervical Cancer Diagnostics for Global Health	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):HPV-associated cervical cancer is among the leading causes of death in women worldwide, with more 500,000 cases and 275,000 deaths annually. While repeated screening through frequent use of the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear has drastically reduced the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in developed nations, the vast majority of cervical cancer-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries with minimal healthcare infrastructure. Cytology-based prevention programs have proven to be extremely difficult to implement and sustain in low-resource settings, and as a result over 85% of new cervical cancer cases originate in developing countries. The lack of adequate infrastructure for traditional cytology-based screening combined with the presentation of cervical cancer, where symptoms are not present until the cancer is in an advanced stage, emphasize the clinical need for a screening test appropriate for low resource settings. Development of a reliable Point-of-Care (POC) test with high sensitivity and specificity has the ability to reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer worldwide. We propose to develop a novel nanotechnology- based diagnostic assay platform to detect cervical cancer progression in low-resource settings. This multiplex assay platform, which is currently being developed for non-oncology applications by Becton Dickinson (BD), is designed to be low-cost, easy to use, and inexpensive. We propose to adapt this platform to develop a highly specific diagnostic test that will screen women who do not need treatment and identify women with cervical lesions who need to be referred for colposcopy. The diagnostic test is based on Surfaced Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) technology, that enables detection of multiple targets in a complex sample without the need for washing or purification. The test and analysis is completed in less than 30 minutes, provides a "sample-in- answer-out" workflow, making the platform ideal for a "screen and treat" test in low-resource settings. Diagnostic development and validation will be done in close collaboration with a multidisciplinary team with expertise in HPV and cervical cancer screening as well as clinical oncology. By combining BD's experience in assay development, global healthcare delivery, and regulatory approval with the clinical expertise of other team members, the team has the expertise required to develop and validate a POC cervical cancer test for low resource settings. In addition to BD assay development, engineering, global healthcare delivery, and regulatory personnel, the team includes Dr. Jennifer S. Smith (UNC-Chapel Hill), Dr. Douglas Clark (UNM), Dr. Mark Stoler (UVA Health System), Dr. Scott McClelland (UW), and clinical validation site leaders including Dr. You-Lin Qiao (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences), Dr. Nelly Mugo (Kenya Medical Research Institute), Dr. Jose Fregnani (Barretos Cancer Hospital), and Dr. Adhemar Longatto-Filho (Barretos Cancer Hospital, Brazil).

In North Carolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions. Community health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable populations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%. Substantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and system-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening targets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based screening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase screening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to systematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for uninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from stakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We hypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective approaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through improved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research, implementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central hypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based interventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable. The specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot studies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a process for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2 (Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening approaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess implementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the multilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This project is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation modeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact on CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities.

project	5UH3CA233282-03	UH3CA233282	10018812	2020	(ACCSIS) Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia	Grant	Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section\nThis multi-site project aims to increase screening and follow-up for colorectal cancer (CRC) in central Appalachia, a medically underserved region recognized as one of three distinct “hotspots” for CRC mortality. Specifically, the Appalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern Kentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the area are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents screened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence on CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with Appalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention and control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted from evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the community (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in 12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base for a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically underserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden of CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test, measure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH and Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI approval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI in a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2) Assess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with community and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to early or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined by US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county- level behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating Center, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community partners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia.

Specifically, the Appalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern Kentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the area are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents screened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence on CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with Appalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention and control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted from evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the community (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in 12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH.

Grant	Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality. The US \nPreventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends CRC screening through a variety of invasive and non-invasive \ntests for individuals aged 50 to 75 years. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and other strategies \nexist to promote CRC screening, but adoption and implementation of these are limited, especially in CHCs. \nOur hypothesis is that a Hub and Spoke multilevel intervention will be superior to usual care. The hub will be \nHealth Quality Partners of Southern California (HQP), a non-profit organization comprised of 16 CHC systems \n(spokes), serving 135 rural and urban clinic sites. We propose a 2-phase study to pilot and optimize (Phase I) \nand rigorously test (Phase II) the Hub and Spoke approach and its impact on CRC screening, follow-up, and \nusual care. UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary \noutcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed \nmethods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients \nserved by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and \ncoordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3 \nImplementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a \nregionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care \namong CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability \nModel (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, \nMaintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness\nof the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post \nimplementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3) \nproportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and \nsustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods \napproach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM \nconstructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e. \npatients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and \nSustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of \nImplementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate \nprogress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are \nscalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.

Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up\ncolonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing\nprogram with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage\npartnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest\nCenter for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation\nsupport to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate\nworking with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics\n(reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients).\nIn Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a\nlarge-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor\nsupported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never\nbeen screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to\nsupport follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and\nrecruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the\ntraining and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings.\nIn Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi-\nexperimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice\nfacilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan-\nvendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never\nbeen screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred\nfor colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will\nevaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and\nqualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program\nthrough partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care\nclinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO\n(Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model.

Since\n2007, a sea change has occurred in the field of cancer immunotherapy, resulting from the success of anti-PD1\nand anti-PD-L1. However, most of the priority agents identified in the NCI Workshop are still not broadly\navailable for academic IITs.\nSince the original award in 2011, the CITN focused on testing these high-priority agents, including 5 of the top\n8 ranked agents that hit targets critical for optimal immune responses.

project	6R37CA230617-05	R37CA230617	10601468	2022	Hormone signaling and translation control in advanced prostate cancer	Grant	ABSTRACT\nThe recent advent of highly potent inhibitors of the androgen receptor and androgen biosynthesis has had the\nunfortunate iatrogenic effect of fueling new lethal prostate cancer phenotypes in patients. In particular, non-\nneuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an aggressive form of this\ndisease, is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The main barriers against\ntherapeutic advances are a paucity of relevant disease models and a very poor understanding of the\nmechanisms that give rise to this phenotype. The process of protein synthesis has long been considered\nsubordinate to alterations at the levels of DNA and RNA in cancer etiology. However, work from our laboratory\nand others have revealed that protein synthesis control is a dynamic process that coordinates not only bulk\nmRNA translation, but also the specialized translation of distinct mRNAs important for cancer phenotypes.\nRecently, our laboratory has developed and characterized a new in vitro and in vivo toolkit of both human and\nmurine androgen receptor-low CRPC. We have used these models to discover a critical link between androgen\nreceptor signaling and the process of mRNA translation initiation, which is critical for androgen receptor-low\nCRPC growth. We hypothesize that androgen receptor-low CRPC is driven by the specific translation of\ndistinct mRNA networks, thereby leading to persistent tumor growth, which may represent a therapeutic\nvulnerability. Our long-term objective is to utilize state-of-the-art mouse models, ribosome profiling, and patient\nderived xenografts to definitively investigate the fundamental link between the androgen receptor and protein\nsynthesis control in a highly relevant and newly emerging disease course for prostate cancer patients. To do\nso, we will address the following aims: 1) determine the mechanism by which the androgen receptor\ncommunicates with the translation apparatus, 2) delineate how aberrant protein synthesis drives the translation\nof distinct oncogenic mRNAs, and 3) elucidate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting translation initiation in\nandrogen receptor-low CRPC.\nUltimately, these studies are poised to uncover a new paradigm for gene regulation in androgen receptor-low\nprostate cancer and provide the preclinical basis for targeting the protein synthesis apparatus in an\nincreasingly common highly aggressive disease.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this\ncomplex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the\nprohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water,\ndense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and\npro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this\nproject has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several\nhighly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and\ninteractions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote\nthe survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that\nsignificantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also\nthe three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In\nthe following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and\nmyeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will\npursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and\nmitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic\nallografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).

project	6U01CA244291-02	U01CA244291	10603047	2019	Optimizing myeloma-specific immunity after autologous stem cell transplantation	Grant	Abstract\nMultiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy and despite improved patient\noutcomes in the era of novel agents, it remains largely incurable. Clinical studies show that autologous stem cell\ntransplantation (ASCT) remains an efficacious consolidation treatment for eligible patients and a subset of\ntransplant recipients achieve long-term control of disease. Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced\nby ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates\ninflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the\npotential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. We have recently utilized novel preclinical models to provide\ndefinitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific T cell immunity and the re-establishment of a state of\nimmune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these systems\nis a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive populations\nand the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. These inhibitory pathways are highly\namenable to immunotherapeutic approaches after ASCT that invoke long term survival. This proposal will utilize\nsophisticated protein and transcriptional based approaches to examine the relationship of T cell function in the\nperi-transplant period to subsequent survival and disease control in well-annotated clinical cohorts. A major focus\nwill be the optimization of innovative immunotherapy approaches after ASCT in preclinical systems for clinical\ntranslation.

Although cytokine release\nsyndrome and neurotoxicity are the earliest and most dramatic immune related adverse events (irAEs) after\nCARTx, severe manifestations are transient and only affect a minority of patients. In contrast, on-target, off-\ntumor depletion of non-malignant B lineage cells affects the majority of patients and all long-term responders.\nCD19 expression declines as B cells differentiate into plasma cells, whereas BCMA is selectively expressed by\nplasma cells. Since plasma cells are responsible for maintaining long-lived antibodies and naïve/memory B cells\nare important for generating new immunity, CD19 versus BCMA-CARTx may differentially affect preexisting\nimmunity and vaccine responses. Dr. Hill’s goal is to understand the long-term effects of CARTx on humoral\nimmunity. This proposal incorporates the expertise of an outstanding group of researchers in infectious diseases,\nimmuno-oncology, epidemiology, laboratory medicine, and statistics who are dedicated to ensuring the success\nof this innovative research proposal. They will leverage their expertise and high-volume immunotherapy\nprograms to achieve the following aims.\nThe first Aim involves a prospective observational cohort study of 130 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 50\npediatric CD19, 30 adult BCMA) with relapse-free survival ≥6 months. Dr. Hill will use a novel systematic viral\nepitope scanning method (VirScan) to longitudinally characterize the antivirome to 206 viral pathogens. These\nresults will describe, and identify correlates of, antivirome diversity metrics at 6- and 12-months post-CARTx.\nVirScan will allow for a nuanced assessment of the differential impacts of CARTx on humoral immune\ncompetence. The second Aim will utilize samples from Aim 1 to determine the effect of CARTx on the durability\nof preexisting humoral immunity to vaccine-preventable infections and the proportion of patients lacking\nseroprotection after CARTx. These data will expand on Aim 1 to inform vaccination strategies. In the third Aim,\nDr. Hill will perform a prospective observational study of 95 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 25 pediatric CD19,\nand 20 adult BCMA) to define the frequency and correlates of positive vaccine responses ≥6 months after\nCARTx. Patients will be vaccinated for S. pneumoniae, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, H. influenza b, and\nhepatitis A and B according to institutional guidelines.\nThis proposal will address critical knowledge gaps by employing innovative methods to elucidate the scope of\npathogen-specific deficits in humoral immunity, and whether vaccination can mitigate these irAEs, after CARTx.\nThe findings will guide evidence-based strategies for infection prevention, such as vaccination or immunoglobulin\nreplacement, to improve outcomes in this rapidly growing population of high-risk individuals.

Since\n2007, a sea change has occurred in the field of cancer immunotherapy, resulting from the success of anti-PD1\nand anti-PD-L1. However, most of the priority agents identified in the NCI Workshop are still not broadly\navailable for academic IITs.\nSince the original award in 2011, the CITN focused on testing these high-priority agents, including 5 of the top\n8 ranked agents that hit targets critical for optimal immune responses. CITN trials are among the few academic\nIITs of these agents, and each trial has defined biologic and therapeutic principles. Two trials have led to\nchanges in clinical practice. The abbreviated Specific Aims for the CITN are as follows:\nAim 1: (a) to continue to conduct innovative early phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for adult cancers\nusing high-priority immunomodulatory agents; (b) to form a Pediatric CITN (PedCITN) to conduct innovative\nearly phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for pediatric cancers using high-priority immunomodulatory\nagents; (c) to provide leadership, infrastructure, and statistical support for the conduct of these clinical trials;\n(d) to continue to access high-priority agents central to immune responses and not broadly available for IITs\nAim 2: to coordinate studies with Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) and other labs for\nspecimen analysis (immune monitoring, biomarker credentialing) of adult and pediatric patients on CITN trials\nScientific Goals of the CITN\n1. Continue trials with T cell and natural killer cell activator and growth factor IL-15, homeostatic T cell growth\n factor IL-7, dendritic cell activator anti-CD40, dendritic cell growth factor Flt3L, and IDO inhibitor ± anti-PD1\n2. Continue trials with anti-PD1 for orphan and ultra-orphan indications, including pediatric cancers\n3. Conduct biopsy-intense trials to identify actionable causes of anti-PD1 failure and linked to therapeutic\n administration of potential rescue agents\n4. Conduct trials to assess therapies that eliminate or activate the myeloid, monocytes/macrophage, and/or\n myeloid-derived suppressor cells that reside within most cancers\n5. Conduct multicenter Phase I and early Phase II immunotherapy trials for pediatric patients with cancer\nThe results will inform future trial designs and improve the understanding of these high-priority agents. CITN\ntrials are designed to identify paths to regulatory approval and will likely change standard practice or spur\nconfirmatory pivotal trials by NCI cooperative groups and industry for adult and pediatric cancers.

The dendritic cell (DC) is a specialized immune sentinel that directs T cells to\ntolerance or immunity. DC comprise a rich network in skin consisting of several different\npopulations, but are understudied, leaving a major gap in therapeutic intervention. We have\nidentified distinct properties for DC in skin that relay information by migrating out to the draining\nlymph node (LN). We find during inflammation skin migratory DC may direct T cells to tolerance\nby unknown mechanisms, counter-regulating and controlling immunity. These cells are uniquely\ngenetically programed in humans and in mouse to dampen immunity with a high expression of\nshared tolerance genes, including some genes such as PD-L1 that have been successfully\ntargeted in the clinic for peripheral tissue cancers including melanoma skin cancer, colorectal\ncancer and lung cancer. We hypothesize homeostatic programming of skin DC leads to failed\nimmune priming leading to impaired early detection of skin cancers. We find these pathways are\nof great importance as therapeutic targets to promote self-tolerance (such as during\nautoimmune disease) or to block tolerance (to improve immunity during cancer). Because these\nmechanisms are distinct they can be combined with current modalities for patients in\nimmunotherapy of skin cancer, vaccine science, and inflammatory skin disease. In 2 discrete\naims, this application will address programmatic conditioning of skin DCs and the unique cellular\nmechanisms by which they promote immune tolerance in both mice and humans, examining\nconsequences during immune priming and early skin cancer growth.

project	7R01CA143971-08	R01CA143971	9759724	2018	Understanding the AGL metastasis suppressor for therapeutic gain	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer kills 15,000 annually and because of few therapeutic advances there is a need for innovation. This project has discovered suppressors of bladder tumor growth and metastasis and shown that low expression of AGL, an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis, and RhoGDI2, an inhibitor of multiple GTPases, is associated with cancer recurrence and death. The Goal of this continuation project is to understand how reduced AGL levels result in aggressive bladder cancer and to translate this knowledge into novel therapies. We found bladder cancer cells with low AGL express elevated levels of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) synthase 2 (HAS2), and its extracellular product HA, and have activated RhoC and Rac1, known drivers of tumor progression. We demonstrated RhoC/Rac1 activity is suppressed by RhoGDI2, linking the actions of the two metastasis suppressors. Cells with low AGL also exhibit increased glycolysis, glucose import and autophagy. When either glucose import or autophagy are blocked, low AGL tumor cells show greater reduction of in vitro growth than cells with higher AGL levels, exposing a vulnerability of these aggressive cells. These data support an innovative Hypothesis: Tumor cells with low AGL generate growth and metastatic signals via production of HA, activation of its receptors CD44 and RHAMM, and downstream effectors such as RhoC and Rac1. For these signals to be actualized, sufficient energy needs to be provided via enhanced glucose import and autophagy. Three Specific Aims will test this hypothesis. 1) Evaluate impact of HA signaling on aggressiveness of bladder cancers with low AGL. We will determine if HA drives tumor progression via its receptors CD44 and RHAMM and effectors RhoC and Rac1 that are inhibited by RhoGDI2. Experiments will use RNAi and receptor inhibition in human xenografts. 2) Determine role of the AGL signaling network in bladder cancer development and progression. We will evaluate the independent predictive value of tumor suppressor genes and components of the AGL signaling network in a large panel of annotated human tumors, to define a predictive multigene biomarker signature and possible new therapeutic targets. We will use full and conditional (bladder urothelium) AGL knockout mice in a chemical carcinogenesis model that generates spontaneous visceral metastases to test whether lack of AGL makes urothelium more susceptible to carcinogenesis and resulting tumors more aggressive. 3) Target molecular vulnerabilities of bladder cancers with low AGL expression. Here we test whether blocking glucose import and/or autophagy reduces in vivo bladder tumor growth. We will use shRNA and pharmacologic agents already in preclinical/clinical testing. We will screen shRNA libraries to metabolic and autophagy genes in cells with low AGL to discover novel genes essential to the aggressive tumor phenotype, with the expectation that some of these will become therapeutic targets. We will evaluate combined inhibition of HA signaling and energy production pathways with the expectation this will have synergistic detrimental effects on tumor progression. Impact: This project will lay the foundation for future biomarker-driven personalized clinical trials that target critical vulnerabilities in bldder cancer while informing us on how AGL executes its unanticipated role in cancer.

However,\ntargeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in\nglioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse\n(GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have\nprevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non-\ngermline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and\nchemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft\n(PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor\nbeads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en\nmasse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this\nMulti-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models\nagainst human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from\ndistinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will\ndevelop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that\nwill be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM\nmodels against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and\ndrug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to\ndevelop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically-\ndefined tumor subtypes. This work will therefore help realize the promise of precision medicine in neuro-\noncology.

Understanding the genetic basis of response and resistance to\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors are critical for improving outcomes with current agents and for\ndeveloping new ones. Patients can undergo dramatic remissions after treatment while others reap no\nbenefit. Furthermore, the immune phenotype shows substantial temperospatial variability and is\ninfluenced by multiple variables. The rationale of this project is that there is a fundamental genetic\nbasis underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors that is poorly understood. Our preliminary\ndata demonstrates that response to immune checkpoint blockade is strongly determined by the tumor\nmutation landscape and dictated by a specific neoantigen repertoire. We will apply a conceptually\nand technically innovative, systematic, multidisciplinary, and highly collaborative approach to\nelucidate the neoantigen landscape underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our\ncontribution here is expected to provide unparalleled mechanistic detail on how immune checkpoint\ninhibitors function and to provide biomarkers to identify patients who will benefit from PD-1 blockade.\nFurthermore, building on data showing that resistance may be mediated by immune pressure and\nimmunoediting, we will shed light into how resistance to these drugs develop, providing definitive\nevidence for causal mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity.

Such an understanding will provide great insight\ninto the mechanisms underlying how immune checkpoint blockade works, provide much needed\nprecise biomarkers, and establish a foundation to develop more effective immunotherapy.

Paradoxically, although estrogens stimulate breast cancers, risk rises markedly after menopause,\nwhen estrogens decrease. After menopause, estradiol falls and estrone is produced largely in fat by\naromatase. Obesity women have high estrone, and both obesity and high estrone, but not estradiol, increase\nER+ breast cancer risk after menopause. Low intra-tumor levels of enzymes converting estrone into estradiol,\nand elevation of enzymes that produce estrone both confer worse ER+ breast cancer outcome.\n Obesity mediates chronic inflammation through NF-κB driven cytokine expression. We showed contact\nbetween invading breast cancer cells and obese adipose tissue induces pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cell\ntypes that stimulate cancer stem cells (CSC) and drive metastasis. Our data suggest that cytokine induction\nafter breast fat:cancer cell contact is estrogen:ER dependent, since blocking estrogen synthesis with the\naromatase inhibitor, letrozole, reduced cytokine induction upon co-culture. While estradiol is known to oppose\nNF-κB mediated inflammation, the role of estrone in inflammation is not known and may differ from that of\nestradiol. We will study how estrone and estradiol, and changes in the ratios thereof before and after-\nmenopause, may influence NF-κB activity and the pro-inflammatory state in obese postmenopausal women.\n We hypothesize that increased estrone:estradiol ratio after menopause shifts ER from an NF-κB co-\nrepressor to a co-activator to up-regulate cytokines in obese adipocytes and cancer cells that drive CSC\nexpansion and metastasis. We also posit that enzymes that convert estradiol to estrone may contribute to the\npoor outcome of ER+ cancers in obesity. Aim 1 will test if estradiol:ER decreases, estrone:ER increases or\ndifferent estradiol:estrone ratios alter ER effects on NF-κB mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine\ngene drivers of CSCs in ER+ breast cancer cells. To test in Aim 2 if estrone cooperates with obesity to drive\nER+ breast cancer initiation and growth, we will co-culture human ER+ breast cancer cells with mammary\nadipocytes from women with different body mass index (BMI) +/- aromatase inhibition and test consequences\non cytokine levels and CSC. We will also implant syngeneic breast cancers into lean or obese wild-type or\naromatase knock-out mice to elucidate if host estrone mediates tumor promoting effects of obesity. Aim 3 will\ntest if overexpression of HSD17B14, that converts estradiol to estrone, increases ER+ breast cancer cytokine\nexpression and CSC in vitro, and increases tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo. We will also compare levels\nof estradiol/estrone interconversion enzymes in breast adipocytes and cancers from lean, overweight and\nobese women. A better understanding of the roles of estradiol and estrone may lead to new strategies for\nbreast cancer prevention and treatment, and to changes in hormone replacement therapies. Shifting toward a\nhigher estradiol: estrone ratio in serum or in breast cancer cells may prove to have therapeutic potential.

Furthermore,\nlower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality\noutcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more\neffective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and\nmortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have\ntargeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a\nstatistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web-\nenabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms\nwill be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider\ncommunication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot\ntrial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly\nreminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control\ngroup (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding\nthe intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to\ndevelop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term\neffects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample\npowered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1)\nan “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group\n(n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a\n“Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET\nadherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning\nsymptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable\nalerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long-\nterm adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures,\nincluding AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will\nprovide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the\n“Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience.

Unfortunately, there are\nsubstantial gaps in existing capabilities in terms of sensitivity. For example, a minimum of many thousands of\ncells is required for in-depth profiling of proteins in a biological sample. We have recently developed a\nbreakthrough technology, termed nanoPOTS (Nanodroplet Preparation in One pot for Trace Samples) which,\nwhen coupled to ultrasensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), enables effective analysis of\nas few as 10 mammalian cells with a coverage of >3000 identified proteins. We hypothesize that the nanoPOTS\nplatform will be an enabling technology to characterize the molecular underpinnings of tumor heterogeneity by\ncreating 3D proteome maps of human tumors. The overall objective of our study is to extend and validate this\nanalysis platform to enable single-cell resolution measurements at high throughput (>100 samples per day) and\napply the platform to create 3D proteome maps of human tumors. Studies in Aim 1 will focus on optimizing and\nvalidating the ultrasensitive nanoPOTS proteomic workflow to enable robust proteome profiling of ≥3,000 protein\ngroups from single human cells obtained by both flow cytometry and laser capture microdissection (LCM). Aim\n2 will evaluate and compare two complementary technologies for increasing measurement throughput to ~100\ncells/day with minimal impact on proteome coverage. We will determine whether multiplexing through application\nof isobaric labels for pooled analysis, or rapid LC coupled with ultrahigh resolution ion mobility spectrometry-MS\nprovides greatest coverage, quantitation and reproducibility for single cell proteomics at the desired throughput.\nIn Aim 3, we will apply the optimized platform to create in-depth proteome maps for human pancreatic ductal\nadenocarcinomas (PDAs) at single cell resolution. Following initial targeted studies of specific cells of interest\nwithin sectioned tissues, we will use a combination of cryosectioning, LCM and the optimized nanoPOTS\nplatform to analyze single cells within the tumor microenvironment. 3D reconstruction of these in-depth, spatially\nresolved proteomic analyses will provide the first global proteomic tumor maps at single-cell resolution. This\nproject will not only establish an innovative measurement capability that will broadly advance cancer research,\nbut will also provide unique molecular insights into cellular heterogeneity relevant to PDA pathology. The\nresulting platform will be disseminated through a combination of publication and commercialization.

Recent clinical and experimental studies addressing this problem require the\narduous collection of pre- and post- treatment data for every new specific treatment and cancer type studied.\nThus, a computational approach that can expedite the identification of molecular determinants of resistance\nvia the analysis of existing large-scale cancer cohorts is called for.\n Our proposal seeks to identify novel ways to counter de novo and acquired resistance through drug\ncombinations. We focus on gene interactions rather than individual genes and leverage large scale genomic\ndatasets and patient response data. Our approach is based on recent work in the Ruppin and other labs\nshowing that genetic interactions can be computationally identified by analyzing omics tumor data.\n To decipher pathways of resistance to cancer therapies, we focus here on studying a new type of genetic\ninteractions, termed synthetic rescues (SRs). SRs denote a functional interaction between two genes whereby a\nfitness reducing change in the activity of one of the two genes (termed the vulnerable gene) is compensated by\naltered activity of another gene (termed the rescuer gene), which restores cell fitness and rescues it. We have\nrecently developed tools for SR data-driven identification from large cancer tumors cohorts, successfully\nenabling the prediction of drug response and emergence of resistance in patients. Building on these\ntransformational results the specific aims of this proposal are:\nSpecific Aim 1. Perform a pan-cancer and cancer type-specific SR-based analyses, focusing on\nmelanoma, breast, head and neck, and colon cancer, identifying the major rescuer genes in each\ncancer type, together with specific recommendations of combinatorial therapies mitigating resistance.\nSpecific Aim 2. Develop a new version of SR analysis tools that will be made publically available\nfor use by others in a standard, user friendly manner and includes analysis of gene methylation and\ngenome wide mutation data, on top of other omics data already utilized in our previous SR inference tools.\nSpecific Aim 3. Experimentally test predicted rescuer targets and combination therapies in\npatient derived resistant cancer cells.\n Taken together the proposed study, will present a transformative SR based approach for identifying and\ntargeting resistance pathways across the whole cancer genome.

Colonoscopy as primary screening has been accompanied by\na modest but steady decline in CRC incidence through identification and removal of precursor lesions, the\nadenomatous polyp. Indeed, there has been a 32% decline between years 2000-2013 in CRC incidence in\npatients over age 50 (thus eligible for screening). Strikingly, during this same time period, the incidence rate for\nthose under 50 has increased by 22%. Thus, new and effective screening strategies are urgently needed to\naddress the rising burden of CRC (≤50 years) which is expected to increase over the next decade with the rising\nyoung population. The objective of the R33 Moonshot Project is to develop a highly advanced screening\napproach to identify the subset of young patients who actually harbor advanced adenomas and could benefit\nfrom colonoscopy via a test that is sensitive to advanced adenomas, low-cost, and that can be carried out in a\nprimary care setting. To this end, we have developed a new technology, partial wave spectroscopic (PWS)\nmicroscopy or nanocytology. Nanocytology performed on colonocytes swabbed from the rectal mucosa is able\nto identify nanoscale alterations in higher order chromatin structure, which are highly accurate markers of the\npresence of advanced adenomas that might be located anywhere in the colon. The goal for the proposed\nproject is to finalize the PWS technology, turn it into a practical, accurate, and low-cost test that is viable\nfor young population screening, and conduct a pre-definitive clinical trial. We aim to achieve sensitivity\nand specificity over 90%. Upon the completion of this moonshot project, nanocytology will be ready for a\ndefinitive clinical trial, which can lead to CLIA approval and launch in clinical practice as a laboratory-developed\ntest (LDT).

The project detailed here commences with the selection and careful\ncharacterization of a dozen fully human antibodies to Glypican-2, the most promising antigen in\nneuroblastoma, from a pre-existing hybridoma stock. These antibodies, along with their full\nsequences, binding affinities, cellular internalization, epitope, and (where possible) crystal structures,\nwill be made available to Consortium members within the first year for use in their modality of choice.\nThis project will explore their utility as components in double bispecific antibody therapy: this double\nbispecific approach targets two cancer antigens and two T cell receptors simultaneously, inducing T\ncell activation and co-activation only in the presence of cancer cells expressing both antigens. The\ndouble targeting strategy should allow for a much higher level of selective engagement and killing\nthan has heretofore been possible with therapies that target only a single cancer antigen, and should\nit prove effective in neuroblastoma the approach is likely to have utility in a wide variety of cancers.\nOne historical weakness for the development of immuno-oncology approaches such as this one is\nthat the animal models have had very little predictive value. For this reason, the best of the\nhumanized mouse models, “MISTRG” mice, will be used both for the development of these molecules\nand for testing the other consortium members’ approaches, where they could be useful. CIVO multi-\nneedle array technology will be employed to simplify the combinatorial challenge associated with\ntesting pairs of bispecific molecules; this technology will also be open for use collaboratively with the\nother Consortium members. In short, the proposal provides the Consortium with human antibodies\nagainst a validated neuroblastoma target, access to the current state-of-the-art in humanized mice, a\nCIVO multi-needle array device to facilitate testing therapeutics, and a double bispecific antibody\ntherapeutic approach that promises a high level of T cell killing and selectivity and a likely broad\napplicability beyond neuroblastoma.

Bridging of this gap could lead to novel immunotherapies. Our long-term goals are to develop novel\nimmunotherapies for leukemia and pediatric solid tumors. Our objective in this application is to investigate the\nrole of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing Stimulation-2 (ST2), the IL-33 receptor in the\nmicroenvironment as well as ST2 on tumoral cells. Our central hypothesis is that we can target the tumoral\nmicroenvironment and tumoral cells by blocking the IL-33/ST2 pathway with neutralizing and bispecific\nantibodies that we will develop. This hypothesis was formed based on our unpublished preliminary data\nshowing that: First, nonmalignant mice deficient in T-bet have elevated numbers of BM-infiltrating ST2+ Tregs\ncompared to wild-type (WT) mice (45% vs 25%, respectively), suggesting reciprocal roles of ST2/IL33 and T-\nbet/interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in Tregs from the BM niche. Second, we observed 10-fold more Tregs expressing\nsignificantly more activation markers in the BM niche of AML-bearing mice than in the nonmalignant niche.\nThird, MLL-AF9 AML cell proliferation was significantly lower in mice receiving donor syngeneic ST2 knock-out\n(ST2-/-) T cells than in mice receiving donor syngeneic WT T cells (2% vs 17%, respectively). ST2 blockade\nalso decreased Treg activation (i.e., KLRG1) and increased type 1 signaling in CD8+ T cells as well as\ndecreased their exhaustion, suggesting restoration of an antitumoral response in ST2-/- mice. The rationale for\nthis study is that once we are able to understand the biology of the immunological microenvironment in the\nmalignant niche, we can propose personalized treatment plans to block the tolerogenic pathways. Similarly,\nunderstanding the biology responsible for the overexpression of ST2/IL-33 on the tumoral cell, will help target\nthis pathway. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Explore ST2 and IL-33 expression on\ntumoral cells and in the tumoral microenvironment from liquid and solid childhood cancers in human and mice;\n2) Examine whether ST2/IL-33 blockade can impact tumor immunity in the malignant BM niche and solid tumor\nmicroenvironment as a proof-of-principle of a novel antitumoral immunotherapy; and 3) Optimizing anti-ST2\nneutralizing antibodies against murine and human targets for translational purpose. This approach is innovative\nbecause, to our knowledge, the function of ST2+ Tregs in the malignant microenvironment, remains virtually\nunexplored. It will also provide biological insights into the nature of ST2+ Tregs and ST2+ tumoral cells in the\nmicroenvironment and determine whether their blockade can restore antitumoral activity and decrease tumoral\nproliferation via a dual mechanism. The proposed research is significant because novel antitumoral\nimmunotherapies that are more targeted and less toxic than classical chemotherapy/irradiation regimens are\nneeded.

project	7U01CA233085-02	U01CA233085	10406767	2019	U01 Proposal Transfer - 2021	Grant	The goal of our studies is to generate robust and long-lasting tumor-specific T cell responses for\ndurable tumor regression in patients with chemotherapy-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Although\nimmunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive T cell therapy, or oncolytic viruses has generated\nremarkable results in several other tumor types, long-term tumor control has been infrequent in EOC patients.\nStudies by our group have identified key stumbling blocks underpinning the limited efficacy of immunotherapy\nin EOC, which include: (i) tumor-derived CXCL12 production that recruits intra-tumoral T regulatory cells and\nsuppressive myeloid cells, (ii) expression of multiple co-inhibitory receptors on tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes\n(TIL), (iii) compensatory upregulation of immune checkpoints upon blockade of one pathway, (iv) low intrinsic\ntumor immunogenicity partially dependent on reduced IFNβ production, (v) inability of TIL to resist immune\nsuppression mediated by inhibitory cytokines such as TGFβ, and (vi) adaptive upregulation of immune\ninhibitory checkpoints. While combinatorial immunotherapy strategies have the potential to overcome these\nintrinsic and adaptive immune resistance mechanisms, they are often associated with unacceptably high rates\nof toxicities in patients. Our proposal addresses these stumbling blocks using innovative, clinically translatable,\nstate-of-the-art strategies to concomitantly reprogram the tumor microenvironment (TME) and T cells, while\nminimizing the potential for high rates of systemic toxicities.\n We have previously demonstrated that an oncolytic vaccinia virus armed with a CXCR4 antagonist\n(OV-CXCR4-Fc) results in direct tumor oncolysis but is incapable of preventing tumor recurrence due to\nupregulation of multiple immune checkpoint receptors and insufficient persistence of T cells in the TME due to\nincreasing levels of immunosuppressive TGFb. To overcome these limitations, we propose to test the efficacy\nof a multifaceted oncolytic virus incorporating the CXCR4 antagonist and multiple checkpoint inhibitors,\nfollowed by adoptive transfer of tumor antigen-specific T cells engineered to resist TGFβ. We hypothesize that\nin vivo tumor destruction by the multipotent oncolytic virus will limit dampening of the immune response in the\nTME and thus further promote the infiltration and sustained anti-tumor function of the transferred T cells\nengineered to resist TGFβ. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims:\nAim 1. To select the optimal combination of oncolytic vaccinia virus-delivered immune checkpoint inhibitors\n that would effectively augment the efficacy of OV-CXCR4-Fc.\nAim 2. Determine the therapeutic synergy of OV-CXCR4-Fc-MICB with adoptively transferred T cells that are\n rendered insensitive to TGFβ.\nAim 3. To manufacture and certify a Master Viral Bank (MVB) and Final Product (FP) of recombinant oncolytic\n vaccinia virus selected in Aims 1 and 2 for IND qualification.

To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections,\nalmost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and\ncommunities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and\naffordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and\nmore likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies\namong AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating\nthat the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing\nPA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0-\n20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the\nefficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal\nlevel) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a\nprivate Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community\nlevel) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA\ntracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other\nactivities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be\nrecruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site\nRCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group,\nto achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 -\nTo improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life.\nAnalyses of hypothesized mediation factors for Aims 1-3 and post-trial qualitative interviews among participants\nwith and without private health insurance will provide explanatory knowledge to help refine intervention\nprocedures and tailor the intervention for future RCTs among patient subgroups who will most benefit. If shown\nto be efficacious, this mHealth intervention to improve PA in AYA survivors is highly scalable because\nsmartphones and social media are widespread, PA trackers are popular and affordable, goal setting can be\nautomated, and social media activities do not require specialized staff.

project	7U01DE028233-04	U01DE028233	10291087	2020	Targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and immuno-radiotherapy for oral cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT:\nRadiation therapy (RT) is a mainstay of cancer treatment. However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it\npossible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence\nat a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor\ncells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune-\nstimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine\nRT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the\ntypes of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating\neffects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral\ncancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived\nsuppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate.\nStudies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an\nimmunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti-\ntumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor\nmicroenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of\ntumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1)\ndetermine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer\nto RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the\nimmunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug\nformulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will\naccomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims:\nIn Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance\nin mouse oral cancer models.\nIn Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment\nwith RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses.\nIn Aim 3 we will develop a novel drug delivery system that can enhance delivery of inhibitors of MDSC function\ndirectly to the tumor and tumor-infiltrating MDSC.

project	7U24CA180996-09	U24CA180996	10449603	2021	Cancer Genomics: Integrative and Scalable Solutions in R/Bioconductor	Grant	Abstract\nBioconductor is an ecosystem of more than 1,500 open-source software and data packages for the statistical\nanalysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is widely used by the cancer genomics\nresearch community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core\ndata classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and\nefficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell\nassays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of\nDNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a\nsingle specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the\ndata. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to\nmeet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of\nsingle-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant\nprioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of\nexperimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create\nprovenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in\nprioritization. Third, we develop scalable infrastructure for the curation, distribution, maintenance,\ndiscoverability, and usability of cancer data resources within and externally to Bioconductor. Finally, we\ndevelop a program of user training and new outreach approaches to support adoption of advanced\nBioconductor infrastructure by developers of new cancer-related packages and existing packages critical to the\ncancer research community.

project	7U54CA209978-02	U54CA209978	9482409	2017	Combating Subclonal Evolution of Resistant Cancer Phenotypes	Grant	Overall abstract\nOur Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution) will develop\na suite of\nsystems-based methodologies to understand how genomic diversity, clonal evolution, and phenotypic change\n . To evaluate their potential for\ntranslation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these\nphenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from\nselection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and\nmodeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets.\nSelective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's\ntumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and\nphenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it\nis not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and\nhow they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other\nquestions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the\nchanges and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using\nour unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will\ntest in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes.\nOur Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in\naddition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of\nthe evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad\nmultisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical\ntargeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor\nheterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our\nmultidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical\nbiologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next\ngeneration of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and\ntheir impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient\nsamples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell\npopulation dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a\nknowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients.\ninteract in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer		BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE	DUARTE	CA	UNITED STATES	ANDREA Hope BILD	DCB	Shannon K Hughes	1531573	>=$1M	1531573	16-Mar-2018	15-May-2017	30-Jun-2022	RFA-CA-15-014	Moonshot
