project	1F30CA260911-01	F30CA260911	10233119	2021	Thymic PD-1 blockade mediates the anti-tumor immune response in pediatric high-grade glioma	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, are highly expressed in human and murine thymus. Despite this knowledge, the function of the PD-1 signaling pathway during T cell development has been severely understudied. In the past decade, immunotherapies inhibiting the PD-1:PD-L1 axis have produced remarkable improvements in the clinical management of several malignancies, at least in part by restoring T cell receptor (TCR) signaling within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, because TCR signaling is essential for thymocyte development, we postulate PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may have profound effects on the function and specificity of newly generated T cells. These thymus-specific actions may highlight a key unexplored mechanism by which PD-1 blockade elicits anti-tumor immune responses. Leveraging this pathway for pediatric cancer patients may be particularly beneficial considering their high rate of thymic T cell production. Our preliminary data illustrate that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) administered in conjunction with anti-PD-1 therapy expands the T cell pool and helps overcome treatment-resistance in murine glioblastoma. This may suggest anti-PD-1 therapy acts within the thymus to promote the proliferation and maturation of HSC-derived thymocytes. Importantly, pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG) is the prevailing cause of cancer-related death in children which emphasizes the need for new therapies. Thus it is our priority to investigate this novel pathway with the goal of improving the standard of care for pediatric HGG and other childhood tumors. Our objective is to characterize how inhibiting PD-1 signaling modifies thymocyte development in health and HGG. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that PD-1 inhibition increases thymic T cell production and promotes the positive selection, or survival, of tumor-specific TCRs. Aim 1 will determine the impact of PD-1 blockade on the proliferation, selection, and output of developing thymocytes in healthy and glioma-bearing mice. Aim 2 will assess the thymic contribution towards the therapeutic response in the context of PD-1 inhibiton and HSC transfer. This work is significant because no prior study has investigated how thymus-specific PD-1 blockade impacts anti-tumor immune responses. The results from this study have the potential to substantially influence clinical decision making and treatment regimens for pediatric HGG patients. This project is innovative because it will utilize nontransgenic mouse models to more accurately define how PD-1 inhibition affects thymus physiology in health and disease. In summary this proposal will comprehensively characterize how the PD-1 pathway modulates T cell development and will investigate a novel thymic mechanism that may revolutionize our understanding of anti-PD-1 therapy in cancer.

DIPG 2-year survival rate is <10% due to its unresectable tumor location and resistance to radiation and available therapeutics. This emphasizes the need for better understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of DIPG to identify new therapeutic vulnerabilities. Histone H3 Lys27Met (K27M) mutations are a unifying molecular feature observed ~80% of DIPGs and pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (DMG). The high frequency of K27M and their exclusivity to childhood DIPG and DMG suggests K27M has a unique selective advantage in a distinct spatiotemporal setting for tumorigenesis. Understanding the regional selectively of K27M and its phenotypic and molecular effects will further elucidate oncogenic mechanisms and help identify new and better treatment options. The Baker laboratory developed a genetically engineered mouse model harboring a conditional knock-in of K27M into the endogenous H3f3a locus which allows the mutation to be studied in a physiologically and developmentally relevant manner. With this model, we showed K27M cooperates with Pdgfra activation and or p53 loss to drive spontaneous gliomagenesis selectively in brainstem and hindbrain locations. K27M causes dramatic loss of the repressive H3K27me3 but only specific changes in gene expression related to neurodevelopment. Single-cell RNA-seq of human K27M DIPGs reveals oligodendrocyte precursors (OPC) are the main proliferative and stem-like population present in DIPGs. We have also showed that depletion of K27M in patient-derived xenografts induces oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation signatures, decreases stemness signatures, and reduces proliferation and tumor growth. In total, these studies indicate a role for K27M in regional selectivity of brainstem tumorigenesis along with altered OL differentiation, promoting OPC-like state. However, many questions still remain regarding K27M and DIPG. Why is K27M found almost exclusively in brainstem and midline pediatric glioma? What are the oncogenic effects and mechanisms of K27M alone? I will utilize our K27M knock-in mice to dissect the regional effects of H3 K27M on glial development and tumorigenesis in vivo (Aim 1) and evaluate the regional K27M-mediated epigenetic and transcriptomic dysregulation in oligodendrocyte development to identify K27M DIPG dependencies (Aim 2). Through completion of these studies, we will gain insights into the molecular mechanisms and spatiotemporal context of K27M that disrupt development and promote tumorigenesis which will help to direct therapeutic development to target the molecular programs involved that are specific to region and cellular state.

project	1F32CA250155-01A1	F32CA250155	10143613	2021	Investigating mechanisms underscoring dichotomous T cell responses between medulloblastoma subgroups	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (30 lines of text): Medulloblastomas are one of the most common childhood brain tumors and are comprised of several histological and molecularly distinct subtypes based on genetic, clinical, and prognostic factors. Transcriptional profiling has subsequently identified four subgroups which include wingless/integrated (WNT)-activated, sonic hedgehog (SHH)-activated, Group 3, and Group 4. Each subtype differs in clinical prognoses, in which WNT tumors have best outcomes, SHH and Group 4 have intermediate prognoses, and Group 3 have the worst outcomes. Standard therapeutic treatment of these tumors includes surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However, long- term side-effects often result in negative side-effects for patients, as noted through global reductions in physiological, psychological, and economic welfare of patients. Immunotherapy, given the success in adult tumors, is an attractive option as it may impart similar therapeutic success with potentially diminished adverse side-effects. Immunotherapies hinge on the relative abundance and cytolytic effector capacity of CD8+ T cells. Activation of these cells is dependent on both the immunogenicity of tumors and on priming by competent migratory antigen presenting cells. Once migrated to tumors, relative antitumor success of T cells is dictated by the capacity of cells to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor environment. T cells must also resist T cell exhaustion which results from the persistent antigenic environment of tumors. Establishment and propagation of this exhaustive cell fate decision has been demonstrated to be intimately tied to epigenetics. Our preliminary data shows striking differences in PD1hiCD8+ T cells between Group 3 and SHH preclinical tumor models, in which there is high infiltration of these T cells into Group 3 tumors and low infiltration into SHH tumors. Conversely, we have observed significantly higher infiltration of PD1hiCD8+ T cells in the tumor-draining lymph nodes of SHH tumors expressing N-Myc as compared to Group 3 tumor-draining lymph nodes. Taken together, this dichotomy may underscore differential therapeutic responsiveness, particularly in the presence of checkpoint blockade. In this proposal, we aim to investigate both tumor immunogenicity and T cell dysfunction as potential mechanisms underscoring these dichotomous T cell responses between medulloblastoma subgroups. In particular, we will examine the inherent immunogenicity of tumors in vivo and determine if established epigenetic mechanisms of T cell exhaustion impacts the abundance and therapeutic responsiveness of T cells in Group 3 and SHH medulloblastomas. The completion of these aims will add to a deeper understanding of the underlying biological differences between the clinical outcomes of medulloblastoma subgroups, as well as inform studies aimed at enhancing the efficacy of T cell-based therapeutics in medulloblastoma. Furthermore, the techniques outlined in this proposal will enhance the professional development of the applicant into becoming an independent researcher capable of running their own research program at an academic institution.

project	1F32CA261034-01	F32CA261034	10234303	2021	Lipid metabolism as a therapeutic vulnerability in BET inhibitor-resistant medulloblastoma	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract  MYC-driven medulloblastomas are a particularly devastating group of pediatric brain tumors that exhibit resistance and continued progression despite standard of care treatments. Our preclinical work[1] identified BET-bromodomain inhibitors as a potentially promising new class of drugs for children with medulloblastoma (MB) and other MYC-driven cancers, providing rationale to evaluate these agents in clinical trials. However, treatment with BET inhibitor (BETi) alone is unlikely to be sufficient for a cure, with most tumors evolving to acquire resistance to single-agent targeted therapies. An attractive strategy to overcoming therapy resistance is to identify and exploit new vulnerabilities that exist in drug-tolerant cells. Metabolic pathways are of particular interest in this context as they often rely on few essential enzymes, are frequently “rewired” in cancer cells vs. normal cells, support and drive adaptive resistance to drug, provide essential survival capabilities, and can be easily targeted with pharmacologic inhibitors[3]. Our previous work applied an integrative genomics approach to identify genes and pathways mediating BETi response in MB[2]. These studies revealed that MYC-driven MB cells with acquired resistance to BETi reinstate transcription of essential genes suppressed by drug and exhibit changes in cell-state and new vulnerabilities not present in drug-sensitive cells. We now have a growing body of evidence showing that BET inhibition downregulates the expression of key lipid metabolism genes and metabolism-related signaling pathways, and that MB cells with adaptive resistance to BETi differentially express and exhibit preferential dependency on specific lipid metabolic genes and transcriptional regulators. These findings led me to hypothesize that metabolic reprogramming creates novel vulnerabilities in BETi drug- tolerant MB cells that can be targeted to overcome resistance. The studies described herein will characterize the altered lipid metabolism of BETi-resistant MB cells, assess the impact of BETi-driven metabolic rewiring on cell signaling and the resistance phenotype, and investigate the possibility of exploiting lipid metabolic dependencies as a novel approach to overcome resistance to BETi-targeted therapy.

project	1K08CA259610-01	K08CA259610	10192359	2021	Developing novel CAR T cell designs using combinatorial antigen detection	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: The applicant, Greg Allen, MD/PhD, is a medical oncologist at UCSF with a long-term goal to lead an independent laboratory-based translational research program focused on cellular therapies. The K08 application is key for his career development, providing him with (1) mentorship from a diverse team of scientists and physician-scientists, (2) formal didactics to expand his knowledge in clinical trial design and tumor immunology, (3) extensive hands-on training in the translation of newly developed cellular therapies to early phase clinical trials and (4) data collection for an R01 application. Research: CAR T cells are a game-changing treatment for B cell malignancies — genetically reprogramming a patient's cytotoxic T cells allows them to recognize and clear tumor cells. Unfortunately for solid cancers the current generation of CAR T cells have been ineffective – no simple single antigen targeted CAR is able to precisely recognize and safely clear solid tumor cells. There is a clear unmet need for the design and implementation of the next-generation of engineered cell therapies to overcome these challenges. The core hypothesis of this proposal is that combinatorial antigen recognition—the detection of tumor cells and tumor microenvironments using information from multiple antigens (with AND/OR/NOT gates) can provide a powerful solution to the problem of precise recognition and allow the construction of more effective therapies. In this project the first aim will investigate the use of AND gates to safely target pancreatic adenocarcinoma by recognizing and overcoming the suppressive tumor-microenvironment seen in this disease. The second aim will apply newly developed receptors that provide NOT gate functionality to avoid CNS toxicity seen with CAR T cells designed to target neuroblastoma. Mentorship and Training: Dr. Allen's training will be accomplished through formal coursework and under direct mentorship of world leaders including Wendell Lim, PhD, chair of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology at UCSF who has extensive expertise in modular signaling platforms, synthetic biology and cellular therapy. Professor Lim has over his 20 years at UCSF mentored ~50 postdoctoral fellow as well as 4 clinical fellows. Dr. Allen will be co-mentored by Dr. Larry Fong, MD, an expert in translational immunology and immunotherapy who leads the Cancer Immunotherapy Program at UCSF and has extensive experience in helping translational immunology researchers achieve independence. Environment: The candidate's training and research will be performed at the University of California, San Francisco, which provides an exceptional research environment with state-of-art facilities and world-renowned faculty. UCSF is dedicated to developing next-generation cell therapies and Dr. Allen will be part of the UCSF Cell Design Institute (focused on cell engineering), the UCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology and the UCSF Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center.

project	1K08CA263179-01	K08CA263179	10282756	2021	Defining a therapeutic platform for DIPG with mRNA CAR T cells and microglia inhibition	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. Jessica Foster's career goal is to become a translational physician-scientist focused on immunotherapy for pediatric brain tumors. This proposal describes a five-year plan to facilitate her transition to independence through the acquisition of critical technical skills and scientific training in brain tumor modeling and evaluation of the tumor microenvironment with single cell RNA sequencing, integrated with comprehensive mentoring from a diverse team of faculty members. She will conduct the proposed studies under the proven mentorship of Dr. John Maris, an international leader in translational neuroblastoma research and immunogenomics. Additionally, her dedicated Advisory Committee is comprised of highly regarded physician-scientists with diverse expertise in immunotherapy and pediatric brain tumors. Finally, the collaborative research environment with unparalleled resources at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia provides an ideal setting to conduct these translational studies. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a devastating pediatric brain tumor that remains incurable despite decades of clinical trials, with a median survival of 11 months. This proposal seeks to use chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, a form of immunotherapy, to target DIPG. Recently GD2 was identified as an immunotherapeutic target for DIPG, and lentiviral GD2-directed CAR T cells were able to successfully treat murine models of DIPG. However, a significant number of mice treated with CAR T cells died due to inflammation and herniation, prompting concerns for potential toxicity from this therapy, in particular in the pons. This proposal is building upon the applicant's experience utilizing mRNA for the creation of CAR T cells that are transient and can be titrated to effect to avoid toxicity, here using repeated local delivery of GD2- directed mRNA CAR T cells to effectively treat DIPG while still maintaining safety. Aim 1 will determine the effect of GD2-directed mRNA CAR T cells on tumor, microenvironment and normal tissue using both immunocompetent and xenograft models of DIPG. Aim 2 will use single cell RNA sequencing to investigate the role of microglia in DIPG development and test mRNA CAR T cells in combination with inhibition of microglia. Dr. Foster's ultimate goal is to create a clinical trial for patients with DIPG using mRNA CAR T cells directed against GD2, as well as generating a new treatment platform for all pediatric brain tumors. These efforts will provide an outstanding foundation for her career as a physician-scientist and the development of an independent translational research program.

project	1K99CA263021-01	K99CA263021	10283079	2021	Reviving cancer immune surveillance with CD4 T cell help	Grant	Abstract The immune system is capable of eliminating advanced malignant tumors, yet cancer immunotherapy success has been limited to a subset of cancer types. Conventional CD4, or `helper', T cells play an integral role in orchestrating immune responses, and can potentiate the function of antitumor immunity: both via activation and potentiation of antigen presenting cell function and antitumor CD8 T cells. My postdoctoral work demonstrated that reactivating childhood vaccine-specific CD4 T cells after intratumor injection of recall antigen (e.g. polio capsid or tetanus toxoid), mediates antitumor efficacy and causes both innate and adaptive inflammation within tumors. The antitumor efficacy of intratumor recall responses were partially dependent upon CD8 T cells, and coincided with infiltration of activated granulocytic macrophages with phenotypes distinct from tumor associated macrophages after direct innate stimulation with Poly IC. Thus, inducing CD4 T cell recall represents a novel therapeutic opportunity, with a distinct mode of inflammatory and antitumor potential. We hypothesize that intratumor childhood vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell recall responses instigate distinct and durable inflammatory reprograming of myeloid cells to potentiate antitumor CD8+ T cell function and mediate antitumor efficacy. To test this hypothesis, we will define reprogramming of innate immunity after triggering intratumor recall responses and determine its role in mediating antitumor efficacy (Aim 1) and test if polio vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell recall responses `help' antitumor CD8+ T cells (Aim 2). These analyses will inform clinically actionable routes to develop recall antigen-based therapies that enlist CD4 T cell help within tumors (the goal of the independent, R00 phase). The clinical translation of these findings will be informed by identifying therapeutic strategies, such as combined innate pattern recognition receptor agonist therapy, that may synergize with recall antigens in mediating systemic antitumor efficacy; as well as identifying more targeted molecular routes to recapitulate CD4 T cell help in tumors therapeutically (Aim 3). The K99 phase of this work will be mentored by several distinguished experts in tumor immunobiology and cancer immunotherapy: including Drs. Darell Bigner (primary Mentor, cancer immunotherapy of brain tumors), Simon Gregory (computational expert), Qi Jing-Li (T cell biologist using transcriptome analyses to gauge T cell function), Amy Heimberger (tumor associated myeloid cell expert who has previously applied transcriptome analyses to define activation/suppressive features of tumor associated myeloid cells), and James Herndon II (biostatistical support). This proposal will enable clinical translation of recall antigens to cancer patients and will seed a research program that leverages the potent immune-stimulating effects of CD4+ T cell help to develop novel cancer therapies.

project	1R01CA222518-01A1	R01CA222518	9973837	2020	Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis in AMKL	Grant	! Project Summary/Abstract Fundamental analysis of the mechanisms of leukemogenesis is required in order to develop optimized treatment approaches. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant RNA modification, plays key roles in RNA metabolism, transcript stability, and translation efficiency. Aberrant regulation of m6A writers and erasers contributes to leukemogenesis, though the exact mechanisms how the methyltransferase machinery is altered in leukemia remains to be shown. Mutations in methyltransferase writers have not been identified to date, with one exception: in the recurrent t(1;22) translocation in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) a component of the m6A writer machinery, RBM15, is fused with MKL1, a transcriptional cofactor of serum response factor (SRF). Understanding the mechanism by which the RBM15-MKL1 (RM) fusion protein causes leukemia will shed light on the role of disordered m6A RNA methylation in leukemogenesis, specifically AMKL but also AML and to cancer in general. We hypothesize that for RM-associated AMKL to develop, the MKL1 domain aberrantly targets RBM15 activity to sites of SRF binding and that RBM15 recruits the m6A writer complex to associated RNAs, altering m6A mRNA methylation and expression of genes that are required for transformation and/or are important for megakaryocyte fate commitment and maturation. We propose focused, unbiased genome-wide studies to determine how the m6A epitranscriptome and the SRF transcriptional networks are coopted in RBM15- MKL1 AMKL. The functional effects of candidate target genes common to the genomic approaches (m6A RNA immunoprecipitation, chromatin mapping, RNA stability assays, and mapping of the translatome) as well as the relevance of critical domains in RM-mediated leukemogenesis will be tested with assays of growth, differentiation and oncogene dependence in RM-induced murine AMKL as well as primary human AMKL patient derived xenotransplants (PDX). The studies are highly clinically relevant as they address a unique mechanism causative of AMKL via comprehensive analysis of fundamental biologic mechanisms, and will reveal previously unidentified regulation of the epitranscriptome that may be a novel shared oncogenic mechanism in AML and other cancers. The proposed approaches are multifaceted, using cell lines as well as genetically engineered animal models, and primary human and murine leukemia samples. The studies will contribute to our understanding of leukemogenesis by elucidating the direct role of a component of the m6A RNA methylase complex in leukemia shedding light on the broader role of m6A mRNA modifications in AML. !

This is true both in international comparisons of rates of ALL in African nations to those elsewhere, and in comparing rate of B-ALL in African-American (AA) children to that in European-American (EA) children in the United States. The inverse association of African ancestry with incidence of B-ALL is independent of established perinatal risk factors for the disease. Moreover, AA children have lower incidence despite having greater exposure to many putatively causal environmental risk factors for B-ALL than do EA children. Common genetic variants established by genomewide association studies incompletely explain the deficit of B-ALL in AA children, suggesting undiscovered contributing genetic factors may be detected by admixture mapping. We have assembled existing DNA samples and data for 930 B-ALL patients with AA ancestry and will additionally accrue ~590 over the life of the project. We will conduct admixture mapping in the assembled group of patients to detect new genetic loci and new variants at established loci associated with occurrence of B-ALL. In addition, we will examine admixture in association with clinical characteristics at diagnosis and survival. Candidate genes/variants will be functionally evaluated through both in silico and in vitro techniques. The proposed research will potentially answer a long- standing mystery by revealing critical genes or loci that explain the comparative deficit of B-ALL in AA compared to EA children. In addition, we may uncover genes or variants associated with the worse characteristics at presentation in AA patients as well as with worse survival, which will indicate avenues for improving outcome among AA children.

Accordingly, the study of cancer predisposing genes and their associated hereditary syndromes provides critical insights into normal physiology and cancer biology. By investigating families with autosomal dominant transmission of thrombocytopenia and B- acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we and others identified pathogenic germline variants affecting ETV6, the gene encoding the ETS variant 6 transcriptional repressor. Subsequently, we sequenced germline samples from 4,405 children with B-ALL and detected similar variants in 0.5% of patients. Further association studies revealed a significant 22.94-fold enrichment of pathogenic ETV6 variants in this ALL cohort compared to 134,187 non-ALL controls in gnomAD (P= 2.2 × 10-16). These data firmly support our overall premise that pathogenic germline ETV6 variants predispose to childhood ALL. To better understand how germline ETV6 variants promote leukemogenesis, we used in vitro assays to interrogate their effects on the functions of the encoded ETV6 protein. Notably, each of the pathogenic ETV6 variants examined significantly reduced ETV6 transcription repressor activity, impaired ETV6 DNA binding capacity and mis-localized ETV6 to the cytoplasm. In parallel, we generated a novel mouse model harboring a recurrent B-ALL-associated Etv6 variant (Etv6R355X). Preliminary studies of Etv6R355X/+ mice reveal significant perturbations in early B cell development, as well as hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) number and function. Finally, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines harboring pathogenic ETV6 variants, which generate dysplastic megakaryocytes, similar to ETV6 variant positive patients. Based on these results, we hypothesize that ETV6 variants predispose to ALL by perturbing key transcriptional programs that impair hematopoietic development. In this proposal, we will make use of our unique model systems to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize the hematopoietic compartments of humans and mice that do or do not harbor pathogenic germline ETV6 variants. We will examine whether WT and ETV6 variant-positive iPSCs or mouse hematopoietic progenitors properly differentiate along various lineages. To establish how germline ETV6 variants influence gene expression in developing hematopoietic progenitors, in Aim 2 we will use RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing to explore transcriptional landscapes and identify putative ETV6 target genes in mouse and iPSC-derived B progenitors and HSPC harboring WT or variant ETV6. Finally, in Aim 3 we will perform comprehensive whole genome and RNA-sequencing of B-ALL samples to elucidate the somatic genetic lesions that function in concert with germline ETV6 variants to drive B-leukemogenesis. We will use in vitro and in vivo approaches to assess the leukemia- promoting effects of these second hits. This project will provide new insights into the influence of germline genetic variation on hematopoiesis and development of B-ALL, the most common childhood cancer.

Here we will test whether radiation  delivered in ultra-high dose rate (one-tenth of second), which far exceed the dose rate used in current clinical  practice (minutes), can significantly reduce normal tissue toxicities associated with the radiotherapeutic  management of childhood medulloblastoma (MB). The overarching goal is to alleviate the long term  neurocognitive and cerebrovascular complications that compromise the quality of life of MB survivors while  maintaining tumor control. To achieve these goals, we will undertake studies using clinically relevant FLASH  and conventional radiation regimens. Two distinct human MB tumor models will be orthotopically implanted  in the brain of nude mice to investigate simultaneously tumor response and neurocognitive function after  irradiation. In addition, for long-term follow up, tumor-free mice will also be subjected to cranial irradiation  using FLASH or conventional dose rate irradiation. Short-term (1-month) and longer term (4-6 months) studies  conducted on tumor bearing and tumor free mice respectively, will critically evaluate tumor control,  neurocognitive, cerebrovascular and molecular outcomes in these cohorts. Preclinical studies investigating the  response of MB tumors, behavioral performance on multiple learning and memory tasks, vascular structure and  integrity and the sparing of the neurogenic niche will unambiguously elucidate many of the mechanisms  underlying the neuroprotective effects of FLASH radiotherapy. Data derived from these collaborative studies  between UCI and the CHUV will facilitate the clinical translation of FLASH-RT to pediatric oncology, where  despite the favorable prognosis of children diagnosed with MB, survivors still suffer a lifetime of complications  caused by their prior radiotherapy, a scenario we hope to ameliorate with our innovative FLASH technology.

Unfortunately, many survivors now live with life-long side effects from treatment itself. Radiation therapy, used for brain tumors, is particularly damaging. The most serious side effect is necrosis which can result in weakness, paralysis or even death. Proton therapy is an increasingly popular radiation modality. Proton therapy reduces exposure to normal tissues and the reby may decrease the incidence of cognitive deficits following radiation. However, recent studies, including our own suggest that certain areas of proton beams may be more damaging to brain tissue than others potentially leading to higher rates of necrosis. Here we will develop high accuracy models to correlate necrosis with the physical parameters of proton beams. These models will include multi-cell type human brain “organoids” as well as rodent animal models. Using these models as well as clinical data, we will identify the physical factors of proton therapy which may lead to necrosis. This is significant in that this data may be used to design safer proton therapy treatments in which the most biologically effective portions of beams are solely placed within the tumor. This should reduce necrosis and improve disease control. In a second component of our study, we will examine the molecular mechanisms of necrosis. Rather than being simple dis-organized death, we will determine if radiation induces an orderly programmed cell death pathway. We will conduct the following aims; (1) relate the physical factors of proton beams with biological response, (2) explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms of radiation induced brain damage and (3) validate the clinical consequences of variability in the effectiveness of proton beams. The knowledge gained will quickly influence the treatment of brain tumor patients and expedite the clinical introduction of agents and approaches to combat the negative effects of radiation on the brain.	3-Dimensional;Adult;Adverse effects;Animal Model;Animals;Apoptosis;Area;Biological;Biological Factors;Biological Markers;Brain;Brain Injuries;Brain Neoplasms;Cancerous;Cell Death;Cells;Cerebrum;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Childhood;Childhood Ependymoma;Clinical;Clinical Data;Coculture Techniques;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Cranial Irradiation;Data;Dependence;Disease model;Distal;Dose;Educational workshop;Effectiveness;Engineering;Exposure to;Glioma;Human;Image;In Vitro;Incidence;Inflammatory;Intensity modulated proton therapy;Intervention;Knowledge;Laboratories;Laboratory Study;Lead;Life;Linear Energy Transfer;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Mission;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;National Cancer Institute;Necrosis;Necrosis Induction;Normal tissue morphology;Organoids;Outcome;Paralysed;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Photons;Planning Techniques;Preparation;Prevention;Process;Protons;Public Health;Radiation;Radiation Injuries;Radiation necrosis;Radiation therapy;Relative Biological Effectiveness;Research;Research Support;Rodent;Roentgen Rays;Role;Scanning;Signal Transduction;Survivors;Techniques;Tissues;Transgenic Animals;Treatment Side Effects;Uncertainty;brain cell;brain tissue;cancer cell;cancer rehabilitation;cancer therapy;cell injury;cell type;clinical investigation;clinical practice;clinically relevant;combat;design;disorder control;high risk;imaging platform;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;induced pluripotent stem cell;insight;irradiation;medulloblastoma;novel;pediatric patients;pre-clinical;predictive modeling;proton beam;proton therapy;radiation effect;radiation response;radiation risk;response;side effect;treatment planning;treatment response;tumor	UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR	HOUSTON	TX	UNITED STATES	DAVID R GROSSHANS	DCTD	Pat G Prasanna	174886	<$250k	174886	2-Aug-2021	2-Aug-2021	31-Jul-2026	PAR-19-325	CCDI
project	1R01CA255643-01A1	R01CA255643	10298611	2021	Leveraging Tumor Suppressor Inactivation for Osteosarcoma Therapy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor, found in the pediatric population and often leads to death due to tumor progression and metastasis. Despite intensive, multimodality treatment protocols with cytotoxic chemotherapy and aggressive surgery, 30-40% of patients still succumb to relapsed and metastatic disease. Current treatment options for these patients are extremely limited. More importantly, the clinical outcome for OS patients has not improved at all during the last four decades. Our long-range goals are to reduce OS disease burden and improve long-term survival by developing molecular-based therapies that target mechanisms of tumor growth and metastasis. The F-box protein s-phase kinase-associated protein-2 (Skp2) is the substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) complex and considered a key oncogene through its ability to target cell cycle regulators for ubiquitin degradation, regulates cell migration and metastasis. Skp2 interacts with the accessory protein Cks1 to ubiquitinate p27 for degradation, thus promoting cell cycle progression and cancer growth. Currently, the oncogenic mechanisms and therapeutic potential of Skp2 in OS is largely unknown. There are specific and rational reasons for targeting the SCF-Skp2 axis in OS, based upon preliminary data generated by the PI and his colleagues: (1) A high Skp2 expression in OS tissues portends a poor prognosis in patients; (2) High levels of Skp2 are observed in many OS cell types, including established cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and primary cultures from OS patients; (3) Skp2 deletion effectively blocks pituitary and prostate tumorigenesis in Rb1/p53-deficient mouse models. In OS, genomic sequencing studies reveal a high rate of Rb1/p53 co-inactivation, suggesting that OS may be susceptible to Skp2 blockade; (4) Genetic and drug-induced depletion of Skp2 reduces the proliferation and invasion of OS cell lines and; (5) Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and OS tumor cells with Rb1/p53 deletion are more sensitive to SCF-Skp2 inhibition than wild-type and Skp2-deleted cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the SCF-Skp2 complex may offer a unique therapeutic opportunity for treating a tremendously challenging cancer such as OS. We hypothesize that blockade of the SCF-Skp2 complex in the context of Rb1/p53 inactivation will reduce OS progression. This hypothesis will be addressed by the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (Oncogenic Mechanisms): To define the pro-oncogenic mechanisms of SCF-Skp2 in Rb1/p53-inactivated OS. Specific Aim 2 (Translational Therapeutics): To determine the effect of inhibiting SCF-Skp2 in preclinical models of Rb1/p53- inactivated OS. Finally, since cancer organoids represent an emerging technology that faithfully replicates the tumor's genetic landscape, we will examine the effect of inhibiting SCF- Skp2 in mouse OS organoids as a proof-of-concept to translate findings into patient-specific therapeutics in the future. The successful completion of this study will be translatable to target the SCF-Skp2 complex to block osteosarcoma progression.

Prevention, therefore, remains the ultimate goal. An essential part of future preventive efforts will involve identifying children harboring preleukemic clones at birth. Several leukemia-initiating genetic lesions have been shown to arise prenatally; however, many other leukemia-initiating lesions have not been examined at birth. Several critical questions remain to be answered: 1) What subtypes and what proportion of childhood leukemia develops in utero? 2) What is the specific cell(s) of origin in which preleukemic clones arise? and 3) Are some newborns more prone to developing leukemia-initiating lesions than others? In this project, we will answer these questions, with a focus on the ~70% of patients with known translocation or point mutation driver events. This project has three main aims. Aim 1: To identify the presence and clonal frequency of prenatal leukemia-initiating lesions at birth. We will obtain matched cord blood (CB) and diagnostic leukemia samples from ~250 childhood leukemia patients in the Children’s Oncology Group Project:Every Child study. Backtracking will focus on ~182 patients with translocation/mutation-driven subtypes. We derive patient-specific somatic mutations from tumor profiling, then use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in flow-sorted CB cells to confirm the presence and frequency of leukemia-initiating lesions at birth, and at different hematopoietic stages. We will also use ddPCR to backtrack lesions in available newborn dried bloodspots (N ~45). Aim 2: To determine the cell of origin of leukemia- initiating lesions, the transcriptomic changes from preleukemia to overt leukemia, and whether secondary mutations arise prenatally, across childhood leukemia subtypes. In 50 childhood leukemia patients where CB ddPCR is positive we will conduct single-cell TARGET-seq on flow-sorted cell populations to simultaneously detect the presence of each patient-specific leukemia-initiating events, secondary mutations, and gene expression in genotypically- and immunophenotypically-defined populations at a single cell level. Aim 3: To determine whether the presence and frequency of preleukemic clones correlate with known risk factors for leukemia. Demographic, perinatal, and genetic risk factors for childhood leukemia will be obtained through parental survey, birth records, and sequencing data. For overall ALL and AML, and for common subtypes, we will test for association between risk factors and the presence and clonal frequency of preleukemic clones at birth, as measured in Aim 1. Identifying a specific cell of origin of preleukemic genomic alterations, and their frequency in neonatal blood, will shed light on childhood leukemia etiology and have important implications for precision prevention efforts. This study will identify key steps required for leukemogenesis by directly comparing the genetic and transcriptomic architecture of preleukemic CB to the subsequent full-blown leukemia. Results will provide a platform for development of large- scale population testing of preleukemic clones in healthy newborns and will enable the first cohort studies examining progression from pre- to overt leukemia.	15 year old;Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Acute leukemia;Architecture;Biological Assay;Birth;Birth Records;Blood;Blood Cells;Blood specimen;CBFA2T1 gene;CD34 gene;Cause of Death;Cells;Cesarean section;Child;Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia;Childhood Leukemia;Cohort Studies;DNA Sequence Alteration;Data;Development;Diagnostic;ETV6 gene;Eligibility Determination;Ethnic Origin;Etiology;Event;Face;Frequencies;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Fusion;Generations;Genetic;Genotype;Goals;Hematopoietic;Infant;Lesion;Light;MLL gene;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Measures;Morbidity - disease rate;Mutation;Natural History;Neonatal;Neonatal Screening;Newborn Infant;Parental Ages;Patients;Pediatric Oncology Group;Perinatal;Point Mutation;Population;Preleukemia;Prevention;Preventive;RUNX1 gene;Race;Resolution;Risk Factors;Sampling;Somatic Mutation;Surveys;Survivors;Testing;Umbilical Cord Blood;cell type;digital;disorder risk;driver mutation;epidemiology study;genetic risk factor;genome sequencing;high risk;in utero;indexing;individualized prevention;leukemia;leukemogenesis;prenatal;progenitor;risk prediction model;screening;sex;stem;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;tumor;whole genome	UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA	MINNEAPOLIS	MN	UNITED STATES	Adam  De Smith,Logan G.

We demonstrated that unlike conventional T and CAR-T cells, V24-invariant natural killer T cells (NKTs) and CAR-NKTs effectively traffic to tumor sites in xenogeneic models of neuroblastoma (NB), which led to initiation of a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial evaluating autologous GD2- specific CAR-NKTs in children with NB. Interim results from this trial have shown that the treatment is well- tolerated and produces antitumor activity, underscoring the need for systematic investigation of NKTs as an alternative cellular platform for CAR-redirected immunotherapy. We reported that repeated antigenic stimulation of NKTs and CAR-NKTs leads to their effector-like differentiation, exhaustion, and loss of antitumor activity. Our preliminary data demonstrate that Wnt signaling—specifically, activation of transcription factor LEF1—is required and sufficient for maintenance of the CD62L+ central memory-like NKT subset and is associated with NKT metabolic and functional fitness. These findings provide rationale for examining the role and potential therapeutic targeting of LEF1 in CAR-NKTs for cancer immunotherapy. Pre-clinical in vivo studies of CAR-NKTs have been limited to xenogeneic models, which do not allow for evaluation of the full spectrum of downstream innate and adaptive immune responses. To address this gap, we have developed protocols to generate and expand highly pure murine NKTs that express a murine CAR targeting the GD2 antigen expressed on human and murine NB cells. We have also adapted a syngeneic NB model that faithfully recapitulates the clinical and pathological characteristics of high-risk NB in children. We hypothesize that 1) LEF1 transcriptional activity is required for and can be therapeutically enhanced to maintain CAR-NKT cell metabolic fitness, in vivo persistence, and durable antitumor activity; and 2) CAR-NKT antitumor activity depends on direct targeting of tumor cells, control of tumor-associated macrophages, transactivation of NK cells and induction of tumor-specific T cells. These hypotheses will be tested in the following specific aims: 1) to examine and therapeutically explore the mechanism responsible for maintenance of human central memory-like NKT and CAR-NKT cells, and 2) to explore the mechanism by which CAR-NKTs mediate antitumor activity in a syngeneic NB model. We will use genetic loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches to study the role of LEF1 in CAR-NKT functional differentiation, metabolism, and antitumor activity using in vitro experimental systems with human cells and in vivo xenogeneic NB models in mice. To study the mechanism by which CAR-NKTs mediate antitumor activity in the syngeneic setting, we will perform a side-by-side comparison of murine NKTs and T cells expressing a GD2- specifc CAR. The proposed experiments will mechanistically dissect the contributions of the native NKT cell TCR, the tumor-specific CAR, and therapy-induced innate and adaptive immune responses.

project	1R01CA262887-01	R01CA262887	10279241	2021	Image-guided combination therapies for radiotherapy-induced neurocognitive impairment in pediatric brain tumor survivors	Grant	Approximately 90% of pediatric central nervous system tumor (CNST) survivors, treated with radiotherapy, experience radiotherapy-induced brain injury (RIBI) and neurocognitive decline later in life. This is a progressive treatment-related side effect, which impacts the quality of life of pediatric CNST survivors. Since more pediatric patients are surviving cancer, there is a growing need for RIBI prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Chronic oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are key contributors to RIBI. Thus, neuroprotective strategies to reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are being explored. Neuroengineering strategies using regenerative stem cells to repair RIBI are also being explored. However, prolonging the survival of transplanted stem cells at injury sites is a challenge, partly due to chronic oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Accordingly, strategies to improve transplanted stem cell survival are on the horizon. For these strategies to be effective, drug delivery systems capable of effectively delivering neuroprotective drugs to brain injuries are greatly needed. Also critical for clinical translation efforts are methods to noninvasively image drug delivery and tissue responses to therapy. Nanotechnology in combination with image-guided neuro-interventional procedures are promising for drug delivery. In addition, diamagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (CEST MRI) is a promising MRI technique that can be used to noninvasively and directly image organic drugs. Although, CEST MRI is based on a magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) technique, it is more sensitive (~1000 times) than MRS. Furthermore, given the inherent correlation between CEST MRI signals, pH, and oxidative stress, it can also be used to image changes in tissue oxidative stress, in response to effective drug delivery. We propose to develop CEST MRI theranostic biosensors and complementary CEST MRI nanotheranostic agents for image- guided combination therapy of RIBI. In Aim 1, neuroprotective drugs will be screened by CEST MRI, and each drug’s potential to serve as a pH-dependent CEST MRI theranostic biosensor will be evaluated in our preclinical RIBI model. The feasibility of imaging changes in tissue oxidative stress in vivo with the CEST MRI theranostic agents will also be evaluated. In Aim 2, we will develop oxidative stress-activable CEST MRI nanotheranostic biosensors and evaluate each agent’s potential to sustainably reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in our RIBI model. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the feasibility of improving transplanted stem cell survival and neurorepair in our RIBI model, by sustainably reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Stem cell survival will be imaged with our stem cell tracking MRI biosensor, capable of noninvasively imaging stem cell delivery, migration and survival. All results will be validated with multi-parametric MRI; PET imaging of neuroinflammation, using the translocator protein radiotracer [(11)C]DPA-713; behavioral tests of memory and learning; histology and immunohistochemistry. This project will advance the development of neuroprotective and neuroengineering strategies for RIBI in pediatric CNS survivors, ultimately improving their quality of life.

project	1R01CA263500-01	R01CA263500	10279921	2021	Developing Safe and Effective GD2-CAR T Cell Therapy for Diffuse Midline Gliomas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer related death in children; among these, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and other histone-3 K27M (H3K27M) mutated diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are the most aggressive and are universally fatal with current standard therapies. Despite several decades of investigational trials testing dozens of therapeutic approaches, median overall survival for DIPG is 11 months. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T-cells have mediated impressive clinical activity in B-cell malignancies, and recent preclinical and early clinical results suggest benefit in CNS malignancies. We discovered homogenous, high overexpression of the GD2 ganglioside on H3K27M DMGs and demonstrated impressive antitumor effects in xenograft models of H3K27M-mutant DIPG following treatment with GD2-CAR T cells (GD2-CART, Mount, Nat Med 2018). Significant clinical experience with GD2 targeting CAR T cells, available mostly from studies in neuroblastoma, demonstrate safety and some early signals of antitumor activity. Safe and effective translation of these findings to children with DMGs would transform the landscape for this universally lethal pediatric brain tumor. This bench-to-bedside-to-bench project will conduct three aims in parallel leveraging a recently launched single institution Phase I trial of GD2.BB.z.iCasp9-CAR T cells administered intravenously following a lymphodepleting preparative regimen in children and young adults with H3K27M DMGs. The first aim focuses on safety, integrating insights gleaned in our preclinical models into trial design to diminish the risk of tumor inflammation associated neurotoxicity (TIAN), to establish best practices and to develop improved grading and treatment algorithms for this novel toxicity. The second aim focuses on efficacy, assessing clinical activity of GD2-CART in DMG and identifying biomarkers and clinical features associated with response. We further address the limitations of standard radiographic imaging in these infiltrative tumors using a novel machine learning aided MRI radiomics approach to quantify textural changes within the tumor and assess whether such changes correlate with clinical outcome, and we assess whether GD2-CART induced changes in CSF cell free DNA can provide a rapid quantitative assessment of antitumor response. Our third aim is a discovery aim, focused on improving understanding of the biology associated with myeloid cell activation following GD2-CART therapy for DMGs, which we observe in preclinical models and we observed in the first patient treated. Here we undertake comprehensive single cell profiling of CSF myeloid cells emerging post-GD2-CART in patients enrolled on the study and in preclinical models, and bedside-to-bench translation using murine models to test the hypotheses that GD2-CART induced CNS myeloid cell expansion/activation limit the efficacy of GD2-CART, are modulated by corticosteroid therapy and that this obstacle can be overcome by engineering CD47 overexpression in the GD2-CART.

TERT oncogene rearrangement with transcriptional super-enhancers leads to substantial TERT over-expression and neuroblastoma in high-risk neuroblastoma patients. Telomerase inhibitors show little anticancer effects and cause life-threatening side effects in childhood brain cancer patients in clinical trials. The transcriptional kinases CDK7 and CDK9 play critical roles in super-enhancer-associated oncogene transcriptional initiation, pause release and elongation respectively, and CKIα induce p53 protein degradation. The CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51 suppresses super-enhancer-associated oncogene expression and activates p53 protein expression, resulting in leukemia regression in mice with no toxicity to normal tissues. Preliminary Data. We have found that CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-knockdown with shRNAs or treatment with the CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51 considerably reduced TERT gene expression and MDM2 protein expression, activated p53 protein expression, and induced substantial apoptosis in TERT oncogene- rearranged neuroblastoma, but not normal cells. Analysis of a RNA sequencing gene expression-patient prognosis dataset from 493 neuroblastoma patients, showed that high levels of CDK7 gene expression in human tumor tissues positively correlated with high levels of TERT gene expression, and that high levels of CDK7 and CKIα expression in human neuroblastoma tissues correlated with poor patient prognosis. Specific Aims. (1) To identify the critical roles of CDK7 and CDK9 in inducing TERT gene transcriptional initiation, elongation and over-expression and CKIα in inducing p53 protein degradation in TERT-rearranged neuroblastoma cells; (2) To identify the critical roles of CDK7, CDK9 and CKIα in TERT-rearranged neuroblastoma cell proliferation and survival in vitro and tumor progression in vivo; (3) To define the anticancer efficacy of the CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51 against TERT-rearranged neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Outcomes and Significance. We hope to demonstrate that CDK7 and CDK9 co-operatively induce TERT gene transcriptional initiation, pause release, elongation and over-expression, and CKIα induces p53 protein degradation; that CDK7, CDK9 and CKIα co-operatively induce TERT-rearranged neuroblastoma cell proliferation and survival in vitro and tumor progression in vivo; and that the CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51 efficiently blocks TERT gene transcriptional initiation, pause release, elongation and expression, activates p53 protein expression, induces neuroblastoma cell apoptosis in vitro, and blocks tumor progression and causes tumor regression in mice xenografted with TERT-rearranged neuroblastoma cell lines or patient-derived neuroblastoma tissues. As A51 is currently in clinical trials in leukemia patients, completion of this project will provide the vital evidence for clinical trials of A51 therapy in patients with TERT gene-rearranged neuroblastoma, against which no targeted therapy is now available for, or has ever be tested in, clinical trials.

project	1R03CA256550-01	R03CA256550	10109666	2021	Genomic Profiling of T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The outcome for patients with relapsed T-ALL is dismal with 3-year event free survival of <15%. Thus, the primary goal in the treatment of T-ALL is to prevent relapse, which requires accurate risk stratification. Unfortunately, no genetic alterations have been identified to date that are reproducibly prognostic independent of minimal residual disease (MRD), making it difficult at diagnosis to identify which patients are more likely to relapse. AALL0434 was a Children's Oncology Group-initiated phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing Capizzi-style escalating methotrexate plus pegaspargase (CMTX) vs. high dose methotrexate (HDMTX), with/without six 5-day courses of nelarabine. Survival on this study was superior to any prior trial for de novo T-ALL, changing the standard of care. Yet, a substantial minority (~15%) of patients had relapsed or refractory (r/r) disease. Our group recently received an X01/Gabriella Miller Kids First award to perform comprehensive genomic profiling on 1262 cases of T-ALL treated on the AALL0434 clinical trial (1X01HD100702-01). This includes whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), and transcriptome profiling (RNAseq) of tumor and WGS of germline. We have separately performed copy number analysis (SNP) on germline samples that will be integrated with this work. We hypothesize that comprehensive genomic profiling of the entire AALL0434 cohort will identify recurrent genetic alterations that can be segregated into biologically relevant deregulated pathways that can be combined with MRD to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes before they relapse and provide rationale for treatment with alternative therapies. In addition, a number of small recent studies demonstrated that many of the biologically relevant alterations in T-ALL occur in non-coding regions of the genome, but no large studies have performed whole genome sequencing in T-ALL. We further hypothesize that whole genome sequencing of a large cohort of patients with T-ALL will identify novel lesions in coding and non-coding regions that will be highly impactful in the understanding of T-ALL pathogenesis. We will test our hypotheses with the following specific aims: (1) identify recurrent genetic alterations that predict poor outcome in T-ALL; (2) identify novel alterations, including non-coding alterations in T-ALL; and (3) identify germline genetic variants that predispose to T-ALL. The goal of the Kids First Program is improve understanding of genetic mechanisms of disease, leading to improved diagnostic capabilities and ultimately more targeted therapies or interventions. This proposal will meet that important goal through identification of germline and somatic alterations in T-ALL that can be used to identify patients that are likely to relapse before they relapse and can be treated with new therapies.

project	1R15CA263868-01	R15CA263868	10290439	2021	Determining the significance of the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction in neuroblastoma.	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor found in infants, with almost all cases being diagnosed by the age of five. The most severe cases of neuroblastoma are linked to amplification of the N-MYC oncogene, which occurs in ~20% of all NB. N-MYC amplification is associated with ~50% overall survival despite aggressive multimodal therapies, highlighting the need for new targeted therapies to combat this pediatric cancer. N-MYC, like any MYC protein, must be able to recognize and bind chromatin in order to activate its oncogenic potential. This project is built on the premise that an essential co-factor for MYC proteins called WDR5 acts to recruit N-MYC to chromatin at genes that work to maintain neuroblastoma function, and that targeting the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction can serve as a focal point for anti- N-MYC based therapies. Support for this hypothesis comes from published data showing that WDR5 is a conserved regulator of protein synthesis genes across multiple cellular contexts where WDR5 binds and regulates these loci through its so-called “WIN”-site. In addition, the MYC family member, c-MYC, requires WDR5 to bind genes associated with biomass accumulation and translation, and the c-MYC-WDR5 interaction is essential for tumor maintenance in lymphoma mouse models. In an N-MYC amplified NB cell line, preliminary data reveal that targeting the WIN-site of WDR5 using small molecule inhibitors results in a genome-wide decrease in WDR5 binding, with a subsequent loss of N-MYC binding at specific N-MYC- WDR5 co-bound genes. And, importantly, disrupting the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction using genetic mutants impairs the ability of N-MYC to drive anchorage-independent growth, providing evidence that there are essential tumor functions tied to N-MYC that require interaction with WDR5. Together these data provide a solid foundation for the notion that N-MYC requires WDR5 to bind and regulate N-MYC-WDR5 co-bound genes that are important for driving N-MYC specific activities. The goal of this project is to interrogate the N- MYC-WDR5 interaction in N-MYC amplified neuroblastoma cell lines and determine the influence that WDR5 has on N-MYC driven transcriptional processes and neuroblastoma function using genetic and chemical perturbations. Specific Aim 1 will employ genetic and genomic approaches to identify the genes that are bound by N-MYC and WDR5, and determine at which genes the recruitment of N-MYC is dependent on the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction. Specific Aim 2 will combine high-resolution transcriptomic analyses with cellular and in vivo functional assays to challenge the significance of the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction. At the completion of these studies we will have identified the precise genes in which N-MYC binding and transcription is regulated by the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction, and have directly challenged the significance of the N-MYC-WDR5 interactions on multiple facets of NB tumorigenesis.

Two targets have been considered for Diffuse Midline Glioma H3 K27M-mutant tumors (previously Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG)), however as neither are exclusively restricted to neoplastic tissue, safety concerns exist with respect to on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Moreover, ancillary treatment meant to boost CAR T function to overcome a constellation of immune suppressive mechanisms associated with the solid tumor microenvironment also has the potential to exacerbate the problem. Our group has conducted extensive preclinical characterization of oncolytic viruses and has demonstrated them to be a highly effective immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. We propose to leverage the tumor tropism of ∆24 oncolytic adenovirus to deliver a CAR target along with CD40L. Our preliminary data indicates that oncolytic Ad∆24-CD40L provides a significant therapeutic advantage in a GL261 glioma model as a monotherapy, and further, can potentiate CD19 CAR T therapy in a proof of concept combination setting against subcutaneous B16-CD19 tumors. The goal of this proposal is to develop a dual therapy approach which builds on direct tumor cell viral oncolysis and CAR T cytolysis, enhanced CAR T cell recruitment/activation by virus-mediated inflammation, and importantly, CD40L-mediated mobilization of endogenous antigen presenting cells, B cells and T cells. We will engineer an oncolytic vector to deliver titratable levels of CD40L using the E. coli DHFR destabilizing domain, and an intracellularly truncated signaling-dead EGFRvIII molecule to be used in conjunction with safety tested EGFRvIII CAR T cells (Aim1). The safety and efficacy of the OV-CAR T approach will be evaluated in a genetically engineered immunocompetent model of DIPG (Aim 2). This project is expected to provide novel insight into how CD40L can mobilize an endogenous B cell and T cell response and support CAR T therapy. Together, we hope to capitalize on the properties of designer oncolytic viruses to more broadly enable the use of CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors, and in particular apply existing safety tested immunotherapies to a devastating and urgent unmet clinical need.

We have recently revealed critical transcriptional programs downstream of CIC-DUX4 that drive malignant phenotypes, including tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, recent studies demonstrate that Capicua (CIC) protein expression is directly modulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathway. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to identify and dissect the critical molecular pathways that regulate fusion oncoprotein stability and expression in human sarcoma. Our studies will reveal fusion oncoprotein-specific vulnerabilities that can facilitate precision-based therapeutic design to improve outcomes for patients with universally lethal forms of sarcomas. The objective of this proposal is to fuse our expertise in Capicua (CIC) biology and MAPK signaling to develop the first precision-based therapeutic approach for CIC-DUX4 sarcomas. We hypothesize, that genetic or pharmacologic MAPK activation will lead to the degradation of the CIC-DUX4 oncoprotein. Our rationale is based on our prior studies demonstrating MAPK-mediated regulation of wild-type (non-fused) CIC protein expression in the context of human cancer. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1) human ERK physically interacts with nuclear CIC-DUX4; (Aim 2) MAPK-ERK pathway activation decreases CIC-fused oncoprotein stability, leading to degradation; and (Aim 3) pharmacologic activation of the MAPK pathway decreases tumor cell survival through rapid degradation of the CIC-DUX4 fusion oncoprotein. The significance of these findings are highly impactful, as there are no effective therapeutic strategies to target CIC- DUX4 sarcomas, which remain lethal in the metastatic setting.

The long-term goal of the Mossé and Maris translational research programs is to substantively improve neuroblastoma cure rates by developing patient-specific therapies that target the unique oncogenic drivers of each case. Within the context of the National Cancer Institute’s Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) we propose a Neuroblastoma Research Program built on richly annotated and highly characterized patient derived xenograft (PDX) and other recently developed murine models of this disease. The central hypothesis to be tested in this Program is that neuroblastoma-specific oncogenic drivers and optimal immunotherapeutic targets can be defined and exploited through rationally designed therapies based on validated and clinically measurable biomarkers. Through our dedicated focus on neuroblastoma and our central role in the former Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program and Consortium, we have developed an investigative team and rich set of resources and reagents to be uniquely positioned to achieve the goals of the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Here we propose to use a large (and growing) collection of PDX models that have been fully characterized with the most modern genomic technologies to address the challenge of prioritizing the large armamentarium of anti-cancer agents in development so that early phase biomarker-driven clinical trials can be designed with the objective of showing potent and specific anti-tumor activity. We propose three specific aims directed towards 1) developing and characterizing highly annotated models of human neuroblastoma; 2) performing preclinical trials with drugs directed against defined therapeutic vulnerabilities in order to prioritize agents for the clinic, and 3) developing the portfolio of preclinical data required for design of clinical trials with robust biomarkers for patient selection and monitoring. In collaboration with other preclinical testing programs, we will seek to determine if discoveries in our program are relevant to other childhood cancers and collaborate across disease groups on clinical development strategies. Thus, this Program will seek to shift the paradigm for how high-risk neuroblastoma patients are treated with the goal of substantively improving the outcomes, both in terms of cure rates, but also by decreasing the toxicity associated with current standards of care.

Accordingly, there is a pressing need for clinically relevant preclinical studies that can help prioritize pediatric indications for clinical application of nearly the entire universe of cancer drugs currently in development. To meet this need, we established a preclinical testing program that has created >300 genomically-characterized pediatric solid tumor patient- derived xenograft (PDX) models between the pediatric oncology programs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and University of California San Francisco. We propose to leverage this large portfolio of models across a diversity of diseases, along with the deep expertise of the team, to establish a NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) Research Team focused on pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas, renal tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) and other rare pediatric solid tumors. The Aims of this Research Team are: Aim 1. Integrate with the Coordinating Center and other Research Teams to prioritize agents for preclinical evaluation. We will leverage our team's translational expertise as well as existing connections to disease committees within cooperative groups to inform and facilitate new agent selection and preclinical evaluation in appropriate models to prioritize agents to advance into pediatric oncology clinical trials. Aim 2. Utilize PDX portfolios representative of disease heterogeneity to assess therapeutic agents. We will utilize the >300 PDX models from MSKCC and UCSF, supplemented with models from the PROXC consortium where necessary, to assess 8-10 therapeutic agents/year using study designs matched to the therapeutic question. All preclinical drug testing will be conducted at MSKCC. Aim 3. Align central and local data analyses to ensure rigor in results reporting. For the purposes of prioritization, we will maintain equipoise in validating (“go”) or invalidating (“no go”) therapeutic hypotheses, and will complement central data analyses with advanced local biostatistical expertise. Aim 4. Translational biomarker discovery. We will leverage the combined expertise of our Research Team to identify clinically translatable biomarkers predictive of enhanced response or drug resistance. In some cases, predictive biomarkers may not be genetic, but instead will depend on transcriptional or protein-based assays of target activity. In other cases, genomically identified biomarkers have to be translated to clinically utilizable assays. Together, the expertise and capabilities of this Research Team will support the rigorous evaluation of novel therapeutic hypotheses in clinically-representative models to enable prioritization and translation of the most promising emerging agents into biomarker-informed clinical trials for children with high risk solid tumors.

project	1U01CA263969-01	U01CA263969	10300360	2021	In Vivo Testing of Novel Drug Combinations for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcomas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the advances made in our understanding of the etiology of pediatric soft tissue sarcomas (STS), the overall survival of those diseases has not significantly improved in over 2 decades. For children with recurrent disease, survival is below 30%, and long-term survivors have an increased burden of disease associated with the curative therapies they received. Therefore, the goal of our research team is to improve the survival and quality of life of children with STS by integrating basic, translational, and clinical research. For the past 10 years, we have consented STS and other solid tumor patients to donate tissue for orthotopic implantation into immunocompromised mice to develop orthotopic patient derived xenografts (O-PDXs). Our O-PDXs have been used for ex vivo high- throughput drug screening and in vivo testing using a standardized preclinical phase I, II, III paradigm. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common STS in children and genomic studies have shown that rare subsets of clonally related cells can survive treatment and contribute to disease recurrence. Subsequent integrated analyses using transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic data showed that RMS tumors retain lineage-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of their developmental origins. More recently, single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) and in vivo lineage-tracing showed that clones of cells can transition through their normal developmental programs. Indeed, single- cell ATAC-seq demonstrated that the cell- and developmental stage–specific super-enhancer activity is correlated with those clonal changes in gene expression. Chemotherapy eliminates the most proliferative tumor cell populations, and the surviving dormant tumor cells rapidly expand and re- establish their developmental hierarchy, which leads to disease recurrence. This is a striking example of the complex cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic signaling within STS and the intricate connection between developmental and oncogenic pathways in childhood cancer. In this proposal, we will perform in vivo testing for 8-10 drugs per year using our STS O-PDX models. The most compelling pathways are developmental kinase pathways (Aim 1), cell stress pathways (Aim 2) and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints (Aim 3). Novel drug combinations will be tested as well as those that include conventional chemotherapy for standard of care. Particular emphasis will be placed on eliminating all the clones in the tumor to improve survival by reducing disease recurrence.

Consequently, the number of patients that can be enrolled in phase I/II clinical trials is small, and most patients will have been extensively treated, hence drug/radiation resistant. Thus, preclinical studies that accurately translate into effective clinical therapy are an essential component of pediatric drug development. Our group has contributed to studies in the PPTP/C that have led to clinical studies through Children's Oncology Group (COG). Of importance, we have developed and characterized over 330 Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX), developed from tumors both at diagnosis and relapse, that can be used to facilitate pediatric drug development as directed by FDA under the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity for Children Act (RACE for Children Act). Based on our studies, both in and outside the PPTC, we propose to use PDX/CDX models of sarcoma, kidney cancer, and hepatoblastoma derived from high-risk patients to identify novel agents and combinations, and to test at least 8-10 agents per year, for which we have expertise. We will explore specific hypotheses to integrate molecular-targeted agents with conventional chemo-radiation treatment, advanced drug delivery systems (antibody-drug conjugates, nanoparticles), and the use of Single Mouse Testing (SMT) as the primary screening approach. In collaborative studies, we will evaluate a new humanized mouse model where testing of immuno-oncology agents is a priority to treat these PDX models. One of the objective limitations of PPTP/C testing was that relatively few tumor models representing a specific disease (n=3-8/disease) could be used within the resource constraints, a number clearly insufficient to recapitulate the genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity of each clinical disease. Our retrospective analysis of PPTP data, and recent prospective testing in the PPTC, shows that a single mouse/tumor line gives essentially similar data to conventional testing' (using 10 mice/group for each tumor line). The advantage of the SMT design is that it allows for incorporation of up to 20-fold more models, more accurately representing the genetic/epigenetic diversity of each pediatric cancer within the same resource constraints. The proposed studies will adopt SMT as the primary screening approach to identify agents that have biologically meaningful activity (i.e. large antitumor effects) and identify tumors that are `exceptional responders' for validation. The SMT approach, when linked to the molecular characterization of PDX models, potentially increases the power to identify biomarkers associated with response. Using SMT we can essentially conduct preclinical phase II trials and simulate the likely clinical response rate more accurately for a given disease. As part of the Ped-In Vivo-TP, we aim to develop highly effective, less toxic therapies for high-risk cancers that afflict children and adolescents/young adults (AYA).

project	1U24CA263963-01	U24CA263963	10300314	2021	Pediatric Oncology In Vivo Testing Program Coordinating Center	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of NCI's Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) is to improve outcomes of pediatric cancer patients and to satisfy the requirements of the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act to assess the efficacy of targeted anti-cancer agents developed for adults in pediatric contexts. To coordinate the activities of the new Ped-In Vivo-TP initiative, we have assembled a team of investigators from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and Seven Bridges Genomics (SB) with unique combined expertise and experience with in vivo cancer models, scalable cloud-based data management and analysis systems, informatics resource development, and multi-site project coordination. Combining the complementary strengths of JAX and SB provides the ideal foundation for a coordinating center to maximize the short- and long-term impacts of the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program for advancing the application of precision medicine in pediatric oncology. We will manage a comprehensive and cohesive testing program to advance precision medicine in pediatric oncology through effective public-private partnerships among pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies, funders, and research organizations. We will achieve this goal through the following aims: Aim 1: Establish and maintain the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Coordinating Center (PIVOT CC) to provide administrative and logistical support for diverse stakeholders in the Pediatric in Vivo Testing Program consortium. We will draw on our team's combined decades of experience with multi-site program management, cancer model development, standardized testing of in vivo cancer models, data management and analysis, and informatics resource development to ensure timely decision making, conformance to standard protocols, resource tracking, and effective communications within the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Aim 2: Provide data management, statistical, and bioinformatics support to ensure data security and integrity. We will leverage existing protocols and software systems at JAX and SB to identify relevant in vivo cancer models and to collect, analyze, and securely manage data generated from testing centers within the consortium. We will perform statistical and bioinformatic analyses on consortium data to reliably inform the evaluation of the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in a pediatric oncology setting. We will develop a public- facing data portal for sharing of data and methods with the broader scientific community. Aim 3: Provide scientific coordination to maintain an efficient and effective preclinical testing pipeline. We will draw from the extensive experience of our team with in vivo pharmacology and coordination of similar consortia to manage and coordinate the testing of agents by the Ped-In Vivo-TP centers at all stages of the process, from the identification of relevant in vivo models to the generation of final technical reports and publication of results. We will develop, record, and track performance metrics for the consortium to inform the evaluation of the program's success and impact.

project	2K12CA090354-21	K12CA090354	10198388	2021	Training Program in Nervous System Tumors	Grant	Project Summary We propose continuation of a multidisciplinary research training program in neuro-oncology based at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer (MGH) Center but integrating programs from across the 7 institutions comprising the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, Harvard School of Public Health, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The primary objective of this two-year program is to train physician-scientists capable of providing a critical bridge between the biological sciences and experimental therapeutics. In order to achieve this objective, the training program emphasizes a didactic curriculum in clinical research methodology, mentor-supervised clinical and basic science research experiences, and ongoing Scholar monitoring and feedback. All Scholars are assigned a clinical trial project during the course of the training program. All 40 clinical and laboratory mentors participating in this training program have extensive experience in neuro-oncology research and training, active research funding, and provide an excellent resource for Scholars interested in translational research. All Scholars have access to dedicated biostatistical and computing support on all projects. An Internal Advisory Committee, as well as an External Advisory Committee, oversee the training program. There is no significant overlap between our unique grant focused on nervous system tumors and other training grants at Harvard focused on medical oncology. Candidates include physicians completing clinical training in adult and pediatric neuro-oncology, adult and pediatric neurosurgical oncology, adult and pediatric medical oncology and radiation oncology. A qualified pool of applicants from these disciplines can be expected to grow from existing and developing sources. Each Scholar has a dedicated two-year block for research and training with minimal clinical responsibilities. Four postdoctoral positions are requested per year for five years with each Scholar making a two-year commitment to investigation. Applicants will be solicited through advertisements, and by active recruitment by the program and individual faculty. The training program remains committed to recruitment of a diverse Scholar pool. We believe that the proposed training program capitalizes on a group of outstanding mentors and superb training facilities and will have the capability to produce productive patient-oriented researchers in neuro-oncology. Since the original award 20 years ago, the quality of the program has steadily improved based upon such metrics as diversity in Scholar clinical specialties, Scholar publications, Scholar academic positions, Scholar leadership of national clinical trials, and Scholar grant awards.

project	2U01CA199000-06	U01CA199000	10296642	2021	NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program - Leukemia	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract This application seeks renewal of funding for a Research Program for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in vivo testing as part of the NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP). Recent US Government legislation, combined with the relative rarity and higher cure rates of childhood cancer compared with adults, emphasize the importance of new agent preclinical testing programs aimed at maximizing the likelihood that only the most active drugs will be advanced into early phase clinical trials. The broad aim of this application is to improve the treatment options for children with aggressive and/or drug resistant ALL by prioritizing new drugs for clinical trials in the disease using state-of-the-art preclinical experimental models. This aim will be accomplished using a large panel of 90 pediatric ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that have undergone a high level of cell and molecular characterization and authentication.  The PDXs to be used in this study were all established as models of orthotopic disease in immune- deficient (NOD/SCID or NSG) mice from direct patient explants without prior ex vivo culture. The PDXs develop as systemic disease in NSG mice and infiltrate the same major organs in mice as the primary disease in human patients. Engraftment and responses to treatment are monitored by measuring the proportion of human leukemia cells in the peripheral blood of mice on a weekly basis, which provides a reliable representation of overall leukemia burden in the animals. Where luciferase-expressing PDXs are available, this testing will be augmented by bioluminescence imaging of animals.  The broad methodology will involve inoculation of PDX cells into NSG mice, a lag time to allow the disease to establish, followed by drug treatment and monitoring to assess drug responses. Methods of response evaluation have been developed using stringent criteria modeled after the clinical setting, in order to minimize the likelihood of over-predicting drug responses in mice leading to failure of drugs in the clinic. The proposed drug testing will adopt multiple formats, including conventional drug testing (6- 10 mice/group), single-mouse trial testing (1 PDX x 1 mouse x 1 drug) and testing of new agents in combination with standard-of-care drugs. In this fashion, this Research Program aims to test 8-10 new agents per year.  By completing the major objectives outlined in this proposal, the long term health benefit aims to improve the treatment options and quality of life for children with aggressive forms of ALL who would otherwise succumb to their disease.

project	2U01CA199221-07	U01CA199221	10299853	2021	Genomically informed agent selection and testing in osteosarcoma patient-derived xenograft models	Grant	Project Summary/ Abstract Survival outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma have not changed since the advent of modern chemotherapy four decades ago and it has been challenging to develop new effective therapies in this disease. Our lab’s long- term mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic profiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying and/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust profiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new agents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it. All of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully achieve our goals. Our overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in osteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in rational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s Oncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets identified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and test agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy data of single agents. Agents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being present in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts of low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with target expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model will be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30 mice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be measured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response, maintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination studies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two surface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and 3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent. Our results will guide the development of the next generation of clinical trials in osteosarcoma.

project	2U01CA199288-06	U01CA199288	10300370	2021	In vivo Drug Testing of Pediatric CNS Tumors Using Patient Derived Orthotopic Xenograft Models	Grant	This application is prepared in response to the funding opportunity: NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (U01), RFA-CA-20-034 to renew our existing PPTC UO1 grant. Specifically, we propose to continue the in vivo testing program for central nervous system (CNS) tumors using our panel of patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models. Brain tumor is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges in clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in cancer patients. However, efforts in identifying new anti-cancer agents for that are most likely to be effective in the clinic have been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly accurate model system. Fortunately, we have established a panel of 150 PDOX models of pediatric brain tumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models are shown to have replicated the histopathology and major genetic abnormalities of the original patient tumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. They not only represent different clinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly identified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors. The xenograft tumor cells can also be cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined with our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for us to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of this unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms of action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our hypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the corresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have better chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo assays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear the therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular characterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to determine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs in multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel panel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS tumors. All the assays are well established and routinely performed in our laboratory; we are uniquely positioned to accomplish the proposed drug studies in vivo. Our findings should provide strong preclinical evidence to support the initiation of clinical trials.

Grant	PBTC Project Summary/Abstract The primary goal of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) is to rapidly and effectively contribute to the understanding and cure of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors through innovative, multidisciplinary and multi-institutional prospective clinical trials. PBTC clinical trial development is not only based upon known prognostic factors but also upon an evolving understanding of pediatric brain tumor biology. The PBTC will continue to utilize innovative study designs and analyses based on state-of-the-art statistical science. Novel clinical trials will incorporate relevant correlative pharmacology, biology, neuroimaging, immunologic and genomics studies in an effort to define and integrate these modalities into a better understanding of pediatric CNS tumors. These goals will be accomplished through a close and continued partnership with the member institutions' basic and translational scientists as well as the clinical trial experts. In addition, the PBTC welcomes partnerships with investigators outside the consortium providing scientific, laboratory and regulatory support for innovative and high priority clinical trials. The PBTC will continue to maintain and grow its relationship with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and its large network of adult and pediatric groups as well as with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. One of the most important goals of the PBTC is to successfully complete focused phase I and II clinical trials of novel agents and treatment approaches that can be then be translated into large prospective phase II and III studies overseen by the Children's Oncology Group (COG). The overarching long-term goal is to improve survival outcome and quality of life for children with CNS tumor diagnoses that so often lead to high morbidity and mortality such as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, high-grade gliomas, infant embryonal tumors, refractory medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and low-grade gliomas. To this end, the PBTC will continue to focus upon introducing novel molecularly-targeted agents via innovative trials to assess the presence of the target in tumor and surrogate tissue, evaluate the ability of the agent to down-regulate its signaling target and better correlate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints with toxicities and clinical responses. The PBTC will also continue to explore therapeutic opportunities for pediatric brain tumors through immunotherapeutic interventions as well as via local delivery of treatments. By focusing on the most common solid tumor in children which also accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths in pediatrics, the PBTC will continue to support the NCI's mission of helping all people live longer, healthier lives through its contributions to cancer research and identification of better treatments.

project	3R21CA242861-02S1	R21CA242861	10260680	2020	A statistical framework to systematically characterize cancer driver mutations in noncoding genomic regions	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer genomes typically harbor a substantial number of somatic mutations. Relatively few driver mutations actually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally neutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on coding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The contribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and current mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due to biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole- genome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new mutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions. Recently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based on the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require prior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that generalizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver mutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For this purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions. Specifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the background mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition of the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical components by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance p-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This strategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions. We will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby deriving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate whether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression levels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding regions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods developed and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform.

A major clinical challenge is to obtain an effective treatment strategy for each patient or at least identify a subset of patients who could beneﬁt from a particular treatment. Since each colon cancer has its own unique features, it is very important to obtain personalized cancer treatments and ﬁnd a way to tailor treatment strategies for each patient based on each individual's characteristics, including race, gender, genetic factors, immune response variations.  Recently, Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP) has been commonly used to discover, validate, and test drugs. QSP models are a system of differential equations that model the dynamic interactions between drug(s) and a biological system. These mathematical models provide an integrated “systems level” approach to determining mechanisms of action of drugs and ﬁnding new ways to alter complex cellular networks with mono or combination therapy to obtain effective treatments. Since QSP models are a complex system of nonlinear equations with many unknown parameters, estimating the values of the model's parameters is extremely difﬁcult. Existing parameter estimation methods for QSP models often use assembled data from various sources rather than a single curated dataset. These datasets are usually obtained through various biological experiments, in vitro and in vivo animal studies, thus rendering QSP models hard to be practicable for personalized treatments. To the best of our knowledge, no QSP model has been developed for personalized colon cancer treatments.  In this project, we propose a unique approach to develop a data-driven QSP software to suggest effective treatment for each patient based on gene expression data from the primary tumor samples. Since signatures of main characteristics of tumors, such as immune response variations, can be found in gene expression proﬁling of primary tumors, we use gene expression data as input. We develop an innovative framework to systematically employ a combination of data science, mathematical, and statistical methods to obtain personalized colon cancer treatment. We employ novel inverse problem techniques to estimate the values of parameters of the model and statistical methods to perform sensitivity analysis. We will use these techniques to propose an optimal treatment strategy for each patient and predict the efﬁcacy of the proposed treatment. The model might also suggest alternative therapies in case of low efﬁcacy for some patients.

However, some clinical trials are excluded from mandatory reporting to the NCI Data Archive, including phase 1 or 2 studies and older phase 3 studies with primary publication dates prior to 2015. Some of these datasets may be useful for secondary analyses by other investigators if patient-level data were made available publicly. For example, a well annotated clinical trial dataset from phase 1 or 2 studies could be used as an external control for the purpose of FDA approval of an agent evaluated in a single arm study without a concurrent control arm. Another example is the pooling of outcome data for an uncommon tumor histology from multiple phase 2 studies to guide the design of a future study. To increase the number of study datasets that are available for public use, COG is requesting an administrative supplement to fund the generation of selected legacy clinical trial datasets.

project	3U24CA055727-26S1	U24CA055727	10240899	2020	Childhood Cancer Survivor Study	Grant	ABSTRACT The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary collaborative research resource established to systematically evaluate long-term outcomes among children diagnosed with cancer who survived five or more years from diagnosis. With the recent successful expansion of the cohort to include survivors diagnosed and treated over three decades (1970-1999), the CCSS is the world's largest established open resource for survivorship research with 35,923 eligible survivors available for investigation of late mortality, and 24,368 participants who have contributed health-related and quality of life outcomes. The resource includes comprehensive annotation of treatment exposure, ongoing longitudinal follow-up and an established biorepository, from which genotyping (SNP array) and sequencing (whole exome) of almost 6,000 survivors will be available for investigators for identification of genetic susceptibility for disease- and treatment-induced late effects. Extensive use by the research community has resulted in: 264 published or in press manuscripts now cited over 12,600 times; 229 presented abstracts; 42 investigator-initiated grants, totaling $37.1 million in funding; utilization by a diverse group of 673 investigators; training of 63 young investigators; conduct of six randomized trials; increased knowledge to inform exposure-based clinical care guidelines; and a highly successful model for multiple national and international collaborative initiatives of pediatric cancer survivorship research. During the next five years, activities will focus on maintaining, enhancing and promoting use of this singular resource. The overarching goal of the CCSS resource is to increase the conduct of innovative and high impact research related to pediatric cancer survivorship.

project	3U24CA209999-05S1	U24CA209999	10227337	2020	Adapting Functional Precision Oncology for pediatric brain cancer	Grant	ABSTRACT Cancers are typically composed of heterogeneous populations of tumors cells characterized by mutations that distinguish each cell subpopulation from one another. The parent grant leverages DNA sequencing and a suite of important new analytical algorithms and visualization tools to identify mutations in cancer patients and track the evolution of a patient’s tumor over the course of treatment. The tools we have developed, or are in the process of developing, form the foundation of a functional precision oncology approach we are implementing at the University of Utah with a combination of set-aside funding from the parent project, and institutional funding. The current Supplemental Request will adapt the tools funded by the parent project for effective use in pediatric cancers. The main objective of this Supplemental Proposal is to adapt our functional precision oncology approach to inform treatment selection in children with brain tumors, a patient cohort that experiences extremely dire prognoses in which rational treatment choice is difficult without precision guidance. There are compelling reasons to believe, however, that such adaptation will require algorithmic modifications. This is because key aspects of our approach rely on genomic mutations in the tumor, but previous studies show that pediatric tumors have a substantially lower mutation load than adult cancers. Therefore it is necessary to expand our functional approach in pediatric cases, and adapt them to lower mutation loads in pediatric tumors. To accomplish such adaptation, we will, first, perform functional drug screening and genomic/transcriptomic characterization in two pediatric brain cancer index patients, so we have appropriate test cases drivin our tool development and testing. We will then, second, analyze the pediatric brain tumor index patient datasets, and adapt our functional precision informatics methods for use in pediatric brain tumors with expected lower genomic mutation loads. We foresee two specific areas of development: because of the substantially lower number of mutations in the pediatric cases, we will integrate the ability to simultaneously analyze somatic copy number variation (CNV) mutations, together with somatic point mutations to (1) reconstruct the genomic subclones that make up the tumor; and (2) to carry out cell assignment to the genomically defined sublones from single-cell RNA sequencing data used to study tumor subclone-specific gene expression behavior. We have already shown that CNVs can be used both for tumor subclone reconstruction and cell assignment, and anticipate that by integrating CNV and point mutation- based analyses in a single tool will allow functional precision analysis of pediatric cancer patients at, or close to, the level achievable for adult patients. 1	Adult;Algorithmic Software;Algorithms;Area;Behavior;Brain Neoplasms;Cancer Patient;Cells;Child;Childhood;Childhood Brain Neoplasm;Childhood Malignant Brain Tumor;Copy Number Polymorphism;DNA sequencing;Data;Data Set;Development;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Drug Screening;Evolution;Foundations;Funding;Gene Expression;Genomics;Informatics;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Modification;Mutation;Patients;Pediatric Neoplasm;Point Mutation;Population Heterogeneity;Process;Selection for Treatments;Testing;Universities;Utah;Visualization software;base;cohort;computerized tools;experience;indexing;neoplastic cell;parent grant;parent project;precision oncology;reconstruction;single-cell RNA sequencing;tool;tool development;transcriptomics;treatment choice;tumor;tumor heterogeneity	UNIVERSITY OF UTAH	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	UNITED STATES	Gabor T Marth,Aaron R Quinlan	DCB	Jerry  Li	152418	<$250k	152418	14-Sep-2020	1-Sep-2016	31-Aug-2022	PA-18-591	CCDI

This exercise is uniquely challenging for pediatric cancers. Even compared to other cancers, childhood cancers are highly heterogeneous, often involving genes not typically attributed to adult cancers and often involving complex, large-scale variations. Childhood cancers also tend to arise in less differentiated cell lineages, progress rapidly, and have much lower incidence and mutation burden. These characteristics are compounded by unique clinical challenges related to developmental factors and treatment-related secondary cancers, resulting in significantly fewer targeted therapy options available to pediatric patients. These challenges have led to a significant under-representation of genes and variants relevant to childhood cancers in public cancer databases and knowledgebases. Thus, there is a critical unmet need for structured genetic variant level data in publicly accessible databases which document diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers for childhood cancers. The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) focuses on accelerating research on childhood cancers by developing and enhancing tools and methods to extract knowledge and enable sharing of childhood cancer data. The CIViC resource is a knowledge extraction and data sharing platform for clinical interpretation of cancer variants. Expert curators extract knowledge and evidence from the literature to produce rigorous and high-quality assertions following widely-recognized clinical variant classification guidelines. The variant classifications are made freely available in the public domain and are widely utilized in clinical workflows. However, to date, CIViC knowledge curation has focused almost entirely on adult malignancies. Other key variant knowledgebases either do not provide clinical relevance, lack childhood-specific interpretations, and/or have restrictive licenses. We propose to close this knowledge gap in CIViC by forging new and expanded collaboration with pediatric cancer experts, and building domain-specific tools for curation and dissemination of high-quality variant interpretations for childhood cancers. The CIViC visual interface will be adapted to better support curation and dissemination of childhood cancer variants interpretations. A modification of our existing natural language processing approach will be used to prioritize literature relevant to childhood cancers and an expert panel will prioritize childhood variants and subsequently perform and also evaluate curation on taskforce calls. Based on the experience and products of this work, we will develop childhood-cancer-specific curation guidelines and conduct pilot development of a childhood cancer variant panel that is capable of evolving rapidly as childhood cancer variant knowledge accumulates in CIViC.

Key elements for success will be the provision of high quality genome sequence data on well-phenotyped patients and their families; the collection and accessibility of data to the research community in an intuitive manner; and the integration of genetic data with phenotypic information in the context of this program and comparison to other large data resources. We propose to continue as a Kids First Sequencing Center at the Broad Institute as we have done for the past five years for the program and as we have also done in support of other large flagship NIH genome projects. Our center brings the domain expertise in high throughput data generation, processing and analysis, and disease gene discovery required to meet the objectives of the Kids First Program. We will apply deep, high-quality whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing data on selected samples. We will be flexible to work closely and accommodate the needs and interests of selected X01 Investigators. We will participate in the evaluation of these data types and their overall impact on discovery and scientific output of the program. A key feature of our center is our implementation of a robust analytical framework for variant assessment and disease gene discovery, which builds on Broad investigators’ world- leading roles in statistical genetics, functional annotation, and clinical variant interpretation as well as access to exome and genome data from hundreds of thousands of samples sequenced at Broad. This has enabled us to build a systematic pipeline for gene discovery that will be made freely available to the Kids First program. With data produced and processed in a consistent way, we can offer seamless integration of Kids First data into our analytic framework. For many of the diseases targeted by the pediatric research community, confident discovery of causal genes will require aggregation of cases across centers around the world. We will partner with the Kids First Data Resource Center in a variety of ways to ensure that the program is well- aligned with other large-scale resource generation projects. With this we hope to support Kids First as a whole and establish standards for data sharing in clinical genomics, accelerating collaboration and facilitating robust disease gene discovery.

EA is a vibrant member of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), focused on practice-changing clinical and translational research across the cancer care continuum from prevention and early detection, through the management of advanced disease and its impact. As an NCORP Research Base, EA has engaged community providers and researchers to develop a robust research portfolio that spans Cancer Prevention, Cancer Control, and Cancer Care Delivery, aligned with the overall scientific themes of precision oncology, immuno-oncology, reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and leveraging novel biomarker platforms. Cancer control trials examine and intervene on challenges associated with cancer and treatment-related symptoms and concerns. EA's portfolio of therapeutic trials yield opportunities to apply patient-reported outcomes measurement science to quantify health-related quality of life, symptoms, and domains most relevant to patients in the context of evolving treatment paradigms. Behavioral and biomarker-driven symptom interventions aim to improve quality of life and cancer survivorship. Cardiotoxicity research aims to mitigate risk through quantifying cardiotoxicity associated with treatment, identifying groups at risk, and advancing interventions to reduce risk. Prevention trials embrace the NCI's broad definition of prevention to include primary prevention, cancer screening, and secondary prevention and aim to identify high risk groups for precision prevention strategies. Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) examines the complex interactions between patient, provider, and system factors that influence care, and adapts and evaluates interventions in heterogenous community oncology practices. Health equity research permeates EA science through embedding disparities-related research questions that span EA activities, adopting a broad view of underserved populations including adolescents and young adults, the elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities and rural residents. Key collaborations with community-based oncology programs will ensure access to EA NCTN and NCORP trials in communities where patients receive their care. EA provides access to existing NCI-funded resources and a network of >10000 physicians, scientists, nurses, research associates (RAs), statisticians, biomedical information technologists, and patient advocates across approximately 600 institutions and organizations. EA has provided scientific leadership in the NCORP community through advancing rigorous, practice-changing clinical trials and translational research in cancer control, prevention and care delivery and is well poised to continue to support the NCI's mission to engage community-based diverse populations in cancer research.

However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers remains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its collaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites. With COG’s significant scientific, statistical, data management and information technology infrastructure, we seek to conduct pediatric clinical trials to define optimal treatments, and conduct laboratory research that will translate into more effective treatments with reduced side effects. The COG directly addresses the NCORP goals of providing access to state-of-the-art cancer treatment at community sites while conducting research in cancer control, including post-treatment surveillance/survivorship, and cancer care delivery. We promote the participation of community-based investigators in all of COG’s research, governance and administration and in NCORP Network activities. The COG’s research goals are to reduce overall mortality and morbidity, decrease acute and delayed treatment-related toxicities, and develop more effective ways of delivering care to children, adolescents and young adults. The COG NCORP Research Base is uniquely positioned to elucidate the impact of different health care delivery characteristics on outcomes, to identify determinants of poorer outcomes in underserved groups including adolescents and young adults, and to develop targeted strategies aimed at eliminating disparities and improving efficiencies for the delivery of cancer care in young persons with cancer.

PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative genomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the disposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer. Annually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto clinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core-member sites and 21 non-core member sites throughout the US, Canada, and Australia. The network institutions are selected through a peer review process, and serve as a national and international model for new agent development in pediatric oncology. The PEP-CTN leverages the database infrastructure and resources of the parent Children’s Oncology Group while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure to ensure rapid development, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical trials. The PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems to facilitate the transfer of response and correlative imaging studies for central review and analyses. The PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer agents into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To expeditiously obtain preliminary efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and pilot studies in order to inform tumor specific trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To perform genomic analyses, including single gene studies or gene panels, to identify appropriate patients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor characteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints, including circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities, into early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect on tumors.. Development of targeted therapy for childhood cancer is a high priority as it offers the prospect of more efficacious and less toxic therapeutics.

project	5U10CA180899-08	U10CA180899	10150804	2021	Children's Oncology Group Statistics and Data Center	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Since the introduction of chemotherapy for the treatment of childhood leukemia more than 60 years ago, the prognosis of childhood cancer has improved dramatically. The overall 5-year survival rate for childhood cancers, many of which were uniformly fatal in the pre-chemotherapy era, is now 84%. Progress for a number of childhood cancers, however, has been limited, with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease. In the US, cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease in children greater than one year of age. Moreover, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health related quality of life complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. Thus, despite our advances, development of new therapeutic approaches must be a priority for childhood cancer basic, translational and clinical researchers. The Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and adolescent cancer research, was founded 17 years ago. The COG’s multidisciplinary research team, comprised of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal is for COG, as part of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), to continue its collaborative research work that supports the mission of improving the outcome for all children with cancer. The COG will design and conduct clinical-translational studies for children with cancer that builds on an increasing understanding of the molecular basis for pediatric malignancies and has the highest potential to improve the outcome. Using innovative clinical trial designs suitable for the study of rare diseases, we will study novel therapeutic approaches including but not limited to targeted small molecule drugs, immunotherapies and cellular therapies. The COG research portfolio importantly also includes clinical trials focused on improving the quality of life children with cancer and survivors. As more than 90% of children diagnosed with cancer in the US are treated at COG member institutions, the COG has the ability to offer a diverse population of children with cancer and their families the opportunity to participate in innovative research. This research effort includes allowing for collection and annotation of biospecimens from all children with cancer, providing the foundation for discovery and accelerating the most promising research efforts conducted in laboratories around the world. The proposal is for support of the COG Network Statistics and Data Management Center which collaborates with COG scientific leaders to design, conduct, analyze and report the results of clinical-translational trials for the treatment of childhood cancers.	1 year old;Acute;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Adolescent;Advanced Development;Australia;Biology;Brain Stem Glioma;Canada;Cancer Center;Cancer Patient;Cancer Survivor;Caring;Cause of Death;Cell Therapy;Child;Child Support;Childhood;Childhood Cancer Treatment;Childhood Leukemia;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Cooperative Group;Clinical Trials Design;Collaborations;Collection;Communities;Companions;Complication;Country;Data;Diagnosis;Disease;Ensure;Family;Foundations;Functional disorder;Generations;Genomics;Goals;Hormonal;Immunotherapy;Industry;Infrastructure;Institution;Interdisciplinary Study;Knowledge;Laboratories;Late Effects;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Mission;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;National Cancer Institute;National Clinical Trials Network;Neuroblastoma;New Zealand;Organ;Outcome;Patients;Pediatric Hospitals;Pediatric Oncology Group;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population Heterogeneity;Population Research;Prognosis;Quality of life;Rare Diseases;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Science;Second Primary Cancers;Survival Rate;Survivors;Time;Tissues;Translational Research;United States;Universities;Work;anticancer research;base;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;childhood cancer survivor;data centers;data management;data sharing;density;design;experience;functional outcomes;health related quality of life;high risk;improved;improved outcome;innovation;member;mortality;multidisciplinary;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;organizational structure;programs;reproductive;small molecule;statistics;survivorship;translational clinical trial;translational scientist;translational study;trial design	PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE	OAKLAND	CA	UNITED STATES	TODD A ALONZO	DCTD	Margaret M Mooney	10077753	>=$1M	10077753	3-Mar-2021	15-Apr-2014	28-Feb-2025	RFA-CA-17-057	CCDI

Over 90% of United States and Canadian children and adolescents with cancer are treated at COG institutions with no racial, ethnic or geographic bias to registration, allowing for near- population-based clinical, translational and basic research. COG has established a strong track record of collecting and banking tumor and non-diseased biospecimens from patients enrolled in COG-sponsored clinical trials, most of which include randomized treatment questions. The COG Biospecimen Bank (COG Biobank), located within the Biopathology Center (part of the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital), aims to provide high-quality pediatric and adolescent human malignant biospecimens to the research community. Upon review and approval, biospecimens are prioritized for distribution to the COG investigators defined in the clinical trial protocols. After the needs of the planned research have been addressed, residual (legacy) banked biospecimens can be distributed to other investigators within and outside COG via the NCTN Navigator The COG Group and Biobank Concierges can also facilitate access to COG legacy biospecimens that are not currently uploaded in Navigator. For all biospecimen distribution projects, a feasibility assessment by the COG Biobank and the COG Statistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) is completed prior to proposal submission. This proposal supports the collection, processing, and distribution of biospecimens from patient enrolled on COG-sponsored trials. The Pediatric Division of the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) then facilitates the distribution of the approved legacy biospecimens. The COG Biobank seeks to directly promote and support outstanding research in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric cancer through centralized collection, quality control, storage, and distribution procedures. The COG Biobank will continue efforts to provide the latest biorepository-based technological innovations and best practices, resulting in constant improvements in our operational capabilities, investigator access to biospecimens, investigator satisfaction, and the stewardship of these precious resources. Under proper regulatory guidelines and in association with the COG SDMC, the COG Biobank will support translational aspects of cutting-edge research by ensuring appropriate tracking of biospecimens as well as linkage to existing demographic, clinical, biological, treatment, and outcome data.

Grant	PBTC Project Summary/Abstract The primary goal of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) is to rapidly and effectively contribute to the understanding and cure of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors through innovative, multidisciplinary and multi-institutional prospective clinical trials. PBTC clinical trial development is not only based upon known prognostic factors but also upon an evolving understanding of pediatric brain tumor biology. The PBTC will continue to utilize innovative study designs and analyses based on state-of-the-art statistical science. Novel clinical trials will incorporate relevant correlative pharmacology, biology, neuroimaging, immunologic and genomics studies in an effort to define and integrate these modalities into a better understanding of pediatric CNS tumors. These goals will be accomplished through a close and continued partnership with the member institutions' basic and translational scientists as well as the clinical trial experts. In addition, the PBTC welcomes partnerships with investigators outside the consortium providing scientific, laboratory and regulatory support for innovative and high priority clinical trials. The PBTC will continue to maintain and grow its relationship with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and its large network of adult and pediatric groups as well as with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. One of the most important goals of the PBTC is to successfully complete focused phase I and II clinical trials of novel agents and treatment approaches that can be then be translated into large prospective phase II and III studies overseen by the Children's Oncology Group (COG). The overarching long-term goal is to improve survival outcome and quality of life for children with CNS tumor diagnoses that so often lead to high morbidity and mortality such as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, high-grade gliomas, infant embryonal tumors, refractory medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and low-grade gliomas. To this end, the PBTC will continue to focus upon introducing novel molecularly-targeted agents via innovative trials to assess the presence of the target in tumor and surrogate tissue, evaluate the ability of the agent to down-regulate its signaling target and better correlate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints with toxicities and clinical responses. The PBTC will also continue to explore therapeutic opportunities for pediatric brain tumors through immunotherapeutic interventions as well as via local delivery of treatments. By focusing on the most common solid tumor in children which also accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths in pediatrics, the PBTC will continue to support the NCI's mission of helping all people live longer, healthier lives through its contributions to cancer research and identification of better treatments.

PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative genomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the disposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer. Annually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto clinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core premier pediatric oncology sites throughout the country. The network institutions are selected through a peer review process, and serve as a national and international model for new agent development in pediatric oncology. The PEP- CTN will leverage the database infrastructure and resources of the parent Children's Oncology Group while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure to ensure rapid development, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical trials. The PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems to facilitate the transfer of response and correlative imaging studies for central review and analyses. The PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer agents into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To expeditiously obtain preliminary efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and pilot studies in order to inform tumor specific trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To perform genomic analyses, including single gene studies or gene panels, to identify appropriate patients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor characteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints, including circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities, into early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect on tumors.. Development of targeted therapy for childhood cancer is a high priority as it offers the prospect of more efficacious and less toxic therapeutics.

project	1P01CA210944-01	P01CA210944	9208826	2017	Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy	Grant	The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology and to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation therapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory effects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across multiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and animal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of projects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT (HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and durvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast carcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the mechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining dendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of resistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in Projects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a state-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to drive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.

The CAR developed at our center is now in international trials for refractory/relapsed pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remain as the major unmet medical need in blood cancers. Our central hypothesis is that therapies with combination of CAR T cells and universal CAR T cells created with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic editing will enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer. We have brought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and published together for many years. Each disease-focused project will be led by a recognized authority in the field. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which will coordinately closely with essential shared resource cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD22 will be used to address the remaining unmet medical need in ALL, which is the emergence of CD19 escape variants; and (ii) universal CAR T cells targeting CD19 will be tested in patients with CLL to determine the role of T cell intrinsic resistance to therapy. In AML, the central problem in CAR T cell therapy is the lack of a known surface antigen that is present on AML but lacking from normal hematopoiesis. The goal of Project 2 is to open a wide therapeutic window by genetically modifying normal marrow to make it resistant to killing by anti-AML CAR T cells, and delivering potent anti- leukemic CAR T cells specific for CD33. In Project 3, the overall hypothesis is that anti-myeloma efficacy will be maximized by (i) combining CART-BCMA and CTL019 to eliminate both the dominant neoplastic PC population and rare myeloma-propagating B cells, and (ii) modifying CAR T cells to circumvent specific myeloma-induced T-cell-inhibitory mechanisms (i.e., immune checkpoints). The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of project management for collaboration and biostatistics, clinical safety and monitoring, and fiscal support (Core A), a GMP facility for manufacture of cells and RNA (Core B), and a state-of-the-art platform for GLP analysis to provide high dimensional data of the samples generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the lessons of CAR T for ALL into meaningful efficacy against all hematologic malignancies.

This work is urgently needed because cancer screening and prevention disparities exist with regard to delivery of evidence-based interventions (EBIs). Effective strategies to improve implementation of EBIs in primary care community health centers (CHCs) that can eliminate these disparities are not known or poorly understood. Implementation science can contribute new knowledge that will transform CHCs' ability to serve the nation's most vulnerable populations. The BRIDGE-C2 Center will: 1) create a sustainable infrastructure for developing, conducting, and continuously evaluating implementation strategies that enhance primary care's ability to equitably deliver evidence-based cancer screening and prevention interventions to all people, emphasizing closing care gaps for vulnerable populations; 2) build capacity and training opportunities, and engage a multi-disciplinary team of implementation science and methods experts, to facilitate the development of innovative approaches relevant to our grand challenge; and 3) identify strategies to improve implementation of cancer screening and prevention EBIs in primary care, and conduct research / develop pragmatic methods to tailor, enhance, and support the adoption and sustainability of these strategies. We will build on the strong established partnerships between researchers at Oregon Health & Science (OHSU) primary care, the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, and the OCHIN Implementation Laboratory (a well-established national network of >500 CHCs that share an electronic health record through the OCHIN Practice-Based Research Network). The BRIDGE-C2 Center will conduct pilot studies that develop and test strategies to improve implementation of EBIs, rapidly scale up successful pilots to conduct large scale pragmatic trials, and widely disseminate effective innovations to primary care practices caring for underserved populations. Woven throughout these activities will be the Center's focus on mentoring and training early career implementation scientists and leveraging collaborations to increase implementation science capacity. The Center's Administrative Core will serve as the nucleus that bridges the Research Program and Implementation Laboratory, providing support for research activities, leadership, governance, investigator development, dissemination, evaluation, and a connection to the national ISCCC network. Our first two research pilots aim to improve cervical cancer screening and follow-up care and tobacco cessation. Our first two methods pilots will create novel capabilities to predict needed implementation support based on provider and practice characteristics. We will spread our discoveries and create mechanisms for widely disseminating our findings and innovations to scientific, professional, and community networks to increase implementation of cancer screening and prevention EBIs and decrease health disparities.

project	1P50CA244431-01	P50CA244431	9869208	2019	Washington University Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Component Background and vision. As an Advanced Center, the vision of the Washington University Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control (WU-ISCCC) is to conduct implementation research to help eliminate cancer disparities in rural and other disadvantaged communities. Goal. The overall goal of the WU-ISCCC is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for rapid-cycle implementation research to increase the reach, external validity, and sustainability of effective cancer control interventions. Our goal and Center activities capture three distinct features: (1) a focus on elimination of cancer disparities; (2) the need for rapid-cycle studies; and (3) the use of systems science approaches to enhance methods and outcomes in implementation science. Setting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration, catalyzes new ideas, and ensures support for research that finds solutions for complex implementation challenges in real-world settings with high cancer disparities (rural and urban counties in Missouri and Illinois). Substantial matching contributions from Washington University will allow us to strategically invest in new ideas. Aims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) advance the field of implementation science in cancer control by conducting innovative and impactful research; (2) expand an exceptional, diverse team of implementation science investigators and stakeholders; (3) organize and integrate Center components to facilitate transdisciplinary team science; (4) develop an Implementation Laboratory (known as the “Innovation Incubator”) to serve as a conduit for innovative, rapid-cycle, and impactful research; and (5) address cancer disparities by making it as easy as possible for disadvantaged populations to encounter, use, and benefit from evidence-based interventions. Innovations and impact. The WU-ISCCC will be innovative and provide a significant return on the scientific investment. First, our Center has distinctive features that include a combined focus on cancer disparities, the application of strategies to conduct rapid-cycle studies, and the use of systems science approaches. Second, we have assembled a diverse, world class team with strong linkages to multiple practice settings that will be critical parts of our Innovation Incubator. Third, we will engage investigators from different disciplines and invest in the development of early career scholars as cancer implementation scientists. Fourth, we will strategically and creatively disseminate products in ways that will benefit researchers, practitioners, and community members. Fifth, we have developed a focused strategy for collective integration of our projects, cores, and units to ensure that the WU-ISCCC impact is greater than the sum of its individual parts. In summary, the WU-ISCCC will be a national resource for furthering implementation science for eliminating cancer disparities.

project	1P50CA244432-01	P50CA244432	9869213	2019	Optimizing Implementation in Cancer Control: OPTICC	Grant	OVERALL SUMMARY The mission of the OPTICC (Optimizing Implementation in Cancer Control) Center is to improve cancer outcomes by supporting optimized implementation of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) in cancer control. Optimized implementation occurs when: (1) the strategies employed to implement EBIs address the key barriers to implementation that are active in the specific settings in which implementation occurs, and (2) those strategies reflect the best possible methods for addressing the barriers. Despite two decades of progress in implementation science (IS), practical tools and guidance to support optimized EBI implementation are lacking; as a result, strategies are often mismatched to barriers and are often not optimized for effectiveness, efficiency, or fit with local resources. The result is suboptimal implementation in the form of lost time, effort, and resources and, ultimately, poorer cancer outcomes. The OPTICC Center will advance IS and, in turn, improve EBI implementation in cancer control by developing, testing, and refining innovative methods for optimizing EBI implementation. The OPTICC Center is a strategic collaboration of the University of Washington (UW), Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI), and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three cores will support its work. The Administrative Core will promote multidisciplinary collaboration, research excellence, and methodological innovation. It will also lead Center outreach and dissemination efforts, evaluate Center impact, and coordinate Center activities. The Research Program Core will conduct innovative implementation studies, method and measurement studies, and small pilot studies that advance the Center’s “grand challenge” IS theme of optimizing EBI implementation. A three-stage approach to optimizing EBI implementation will be taken—identify and prioritize barriers, match strategies, and test strategies—with measurement development spanning all three stages. The Implementation Laboratory Core will establish and coordinate a network of diverse clinical and community sites to conduct “in vivo” IS studies, implement cancer control EBIs, and shape the Center’s research agenda. The Center’s initial studies will focus on optimizing implementation of screening EBIs for cervical, colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer. However, the methods for optimizing EBI implementation that the Center will develop, test, and refine can be applied broadly across the cancer care continuum, for a wide range of cancers, to answer a wide range of IS questions.

project	1P50CA244433-01	P50CA244433	9869339	2019	The Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity	Grant	Abstract - Overall After decades of research developing and testing interventions for cancer control, we have the evidence needed to prevent more than half of all cancers. The impact of these strategies on cancer outcomes is significant for both the general population and low income and under-represented groups that bear a disproportionate share of preventable cancer burden, but evidence-based interventions have not been uniformly used across population groups. Gaps in implementation of the evidence base can be seen for nearly all known cancer prevention and early detection strategies. As a result, we incur substantial avoidable cancer morbidity and mortality and tolerate preventable inequities. The Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity (ISCCCE) will create an ecosystem for robust implementation science (IS) related to cancer prevention and control in Massachusetts community health centers (CHCs) and their local communities. Our theme, improving community health by integrating health equity and implementation science for evidence-based cancer control, reflects our critical mass of expertise in cancer disparities, IS, and community-based cancer prevention and control research. Our “grand challenge” is to address the inequitable implementation and limited scale of evidence-based interventions by developing and testing implementation strategies aimed at narrowing health inequities and by advancing methods that carefully consider the low-resource, complex nature of CHCs where adaptation and cost-effective solutions are needed most. The implementation studies we conduct will address inequities within CHC clinical practice as well as prevention interventions that link to community resources and assets. Our I-Lab is comprised of 31 CHCs who are members of the Mass League of Community Health Centers and use a common EHR vendor- neutral population management system that has extensive reporting capability within and across CHCs, which will allow us to study implementation outcomes in different geographic settings across the state using common measures. Given that achieving equity in community health requires clinical, community, and policy-level interventions, our pilots will also examine how to expand the impact and sustainability of CHCs’ cancer prevention efforts through effective partnerships in community and policy settings. Our Network Unit connects us directly with other Moonshot IS initiatives and national community health leadership, and expands opportunities for collaboration and synergy, building IS capacity in our own institutions and across the nation.

These models and methods will be used to guide selection and implementation of evidence-based programs for cancer prevention and control (CPC). We will initially focus on lung cancer screening in rural primary care settings, first in Colorado and then nationally through collaboration with a well- established primary care network (i.e., National Research Network). Our overarching framework will be our enhanced RE-AIM/PRISM model, which is an extension of the broadly used Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework with the addition of contextual factors (e.g., Intervention characteristics, implementation and sustainability infrastructure). It will serve as the basis to develop and test innovative assessments of costs, benefits, and value from the perspective of different stakeholders to understand and guide implementation. We will meaningfully engage with and include the perspectives of patients, providers, and staff stakeholders in all our studies. Our pilot Implementation Study will adapt, implement, and evaluate strategies using stakeholder-engaged approaches to value to guide the implementation of shared decision-making and smoking cessation related to lung cancer screening. Our Methods Unit will refine and evaluate our pragmatic cost assessment methods to determine implementation/replication costs from the perspective(s) of patients, providers, and delivery staff and then develop and pilot test brief survey measures of preferences regarding the relative benefit of different RE-AIM outcomes. We will then assess relationships among RE-AIM outcomes preferences and selection of different CPC programs. Finally, our Outreach and Network Unit will engage in a) outreach activities targeted at junior and mid-career investigators and practitioners including online professional development (e.g., graduate certificate program, micro-certification) and tailored mentoring and technical assistance approaches; b) dissemination activities to support the packaging and communication of research findings; and c) collaboration activities to facilitate partnerships on CPC and implementation science using multiple channels and including development of shared pragmatic D&I measures and data.

project	1P50CA244690-01	P50CA244690	9870182	2020	Advancing the Quality of Cancer Care through Behavioral Economics and Implementation Science	Grant	The grand challenge addressed by the Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (Penn ISC3) is to apply insights from behavioral economics to accelerate the pace at which evidence-based practices for cancer care are deployed to improve outcomes for individuals with cancer. Penn offers a unique environment in which to conduct this paradigm-shifting work, given our expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, and innovative cancer care delivery. The complementary and multi-disciplinary expertise of the three MPIs (Bei- das, Bekelman, Schnoll), coupled with existing Penn resources, including the Penn Center for Cancer Care Innovation [PC3I], the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics [CHIBE], and the Penn Imple- mentation Science Center at the Leonard Davis Institute [PISCE@LDI], represent a unique opportunity to ad- vance the quality of cancer care. The Administrative Core, led by Drs. Beidas, Bekelman, and Schnoll, will ensure that the activities of Penn ISC3 are coordinated, synergistic, and congruent with timelines. The Implementation Laboratory, led by Drs. Bekelman and Shulman, represents a diverse ecosystem that includes five hospitals and linked clinical sites, with over 200 oncologists that serve over 15,000 unique new patients annually. Our Research Program, led by Drs. Beidas and Buttenheim, will oversee the development and testing of implementation strat- egies that target patients and clinicians within our Implementation Lab and are centered on the idea of ‘nudging’ for optimal implementation and effectiveness outcomes. The Research Program includes investigators with ex- pertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery research, healthcare innovation, measurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we propose three Signature Pilot Projects and two Methods Projects with a commitment to rapid learning that will allow Penn ISC3 to be optimally nimble. Signature Pilot Project 1 (Jenssen/Leone) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase referral to tobacco cessation programs among cancer patients. Signature Pilot Project 2 (Bekelman/Patel) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase higher-value bone modifying agents in patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Common methods and measures are linked to allow for pooling of data and to accomplish our objectives of testing multilevel implementation strategies and mechanisms across contexts. Our exploratory and high-reward Signature Pilot Project 3 (Bekelman/Rendle) will test a patient-directed imple- mentation strategy that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to promote oral chemotherapy ad- herence and symptom management. Two methods projects, in support of the Projects, will advance the science of implementation methods. Methods Project 1 will develop a toolkit for the application of rapid cycle approaches (Asch/Buttenheim); Methods Project 2 will use qualitative comparative analysis to characterize multilevel con- textual variation (Barg/Rendle). The Penn ISC3 has the potential to identify novel, disseminable, and scalable ways to advance the quality of cancer care and improve the health outcomes for individuals with cancer.

The Administrative Core will manage the Center, ensure that iDAPT is engaged with “real world” clinical partners, patients, and families, is well-networked with the Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control consortium, and engage in a comprehensive evaluation of Center activities and milestones. The Research Program will include an Implementation Studies Unit with an initial 2-year pilot study using adaptable technology to enhance shared decision-making in survivorship care planning for survivors of breast cancer. The Research Program also includes a Methods Unit with an initial innovation pilot study to test the feasibility of natural language processing to measure communication patterns pre-implementation and to monitor implementation fidelity of programs designed to enhance within-team and clinical team-to-patient electronic communication. The Research Program is expected to complete 8 to 10 pilot studies. In order to foster research aligned with iDAPT’s theme, we will build and sustain iDAPT’s Implementation Laboratory which incorporates capacity building and infrastructure for testing the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and real time deployment of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The laboratory includes primary care and oncology clinics in our local “Hubs” in southern Appalachia (North Carolina) and the northeast (Massachusetts) and “Spokes” including over 900 community-based oncology clinics in the NCIs National Community Oncology Research Program and nationwide Veteran’s Administration clinics. iDAPTs leadership is a multi-disciplinary team of experts with extensive experience in cancer-focused implementation science, behavioral science, computer engineering and computer science, clinical informatics, formative qualitative methods, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The iDAPT Developing Center will be considered successful if we achieve the following outcomes: (1) a robust, collaborative Implementation Laboratory with partners who are knowledgeable and experienced with implementation science in cancer control; (2) completion of 8 to 10 pilot projects related to iDAPTs emerging theme; (3) pilot grantees and lab partners are prepared to lead investigator initiated studies as a result of capacity building and pilot grant experiences; (4) junior faculty and underrepresented persons are engaged in all Center activities; (5) The field of implementation science in cancer control is advanced aligned within iDAPT’s emerging theme; and (6) iDAPT is part of a new network of ISCCCs who collectively build the field of implementation science in cancer control.

Much of the focus has been place on T cells, in particular via checkpoint therapies such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1. Little is currently known of how individual populations of myeloid cells can be partners for T cells. We have recently isolated rare populations of myeloid cells that appear critical for robust responses but we don't yet fully understand how they work. We hypothesize that rare stimulatory dendritic cells traffic antigens and stimulate T cell according to specialized rules and that harnessing and modulation of this pathway is part of the reason that checkpoint blockades may work. We further hypothesize that specific tissue-based cells are responsible for upregulating the critical cytokine to make stimulatory dendritic cells but that tissue production is dysregulated in cancer and possibly improved with checkpoint therapies. In this proposal we will be vastly extending an approach that my lab has been pursuing over the last few years. Specifically we will be extending our cell-biology based studies of these critical cells (Aim1) to understand how they play a fundamental role in antigen trafficking. Additionally, we will seek to understand how they hand off antigen to other antigen-presenting cells in the lymph node to engage T cells (Aim2) and how both of these processes are affected by checkpoint blockades. Finally, in aim 3, we will seek to understand the normal and intratumoral production of the cytokine Flt3L, a key player in regulating the number of these rare cells. At the end of this work, we will understand how these intratumoral myeloid cells function on their own and in concert with T cell therapies.

The intimate relationship between gammaherpesviruses and B cell differentiation is directly linked to the lymphomagenic capacity of these viruses. To ensure the establishment of long-term latency in memory B cells, gammaherpesviruses drive a unique polyclonal germinal center reaction during early infection. Germinal center reaction represents a stage of B cell differentiation that is characterized by rapid division of activated B cells along with genetic instability driven by enzymes that either induce DNA breaks or mutagenize DNA. It is not surprising that most Epstein-Barr virus-driven B cell lymphomas originate from germinal center or post germinal center B cells. This robust, gammaherpesvirus-stimulated germinal center reaction is transient and returns to near-baseline levels in long-term infected hosts. Importantly, it is not clear what attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. We have identified Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 (IRF-1) as the first host factor that specifically attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. Studies proposed here test the hypothesis that IRF-1 is the critical host factor that attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven expansion and transformation of germinal center B cells throughout life-long infection. The proposed studies will define IRF-1-mediated signaling changes that attenuate gammaherpesvirus-driven expansion of germinal center response and the relative contributions of B- and T cell-intrinsic functions of IRF-1 to this process. Further, proposed studies will develop a novel animal model of gammaherpesvirus lymphomagenesis. Successful completion of the proposed studies will offer insights into the tumor suppressor mechanisms of IRF-1 and generate novel animal models that will be of value to infectious disease, immunology, and cancer fields.

Small animal, and in particular mouse, model systems are attractive to researchers for numerous reasons, including their ease of use and well-described platforms. Immunotherapy has revolutionized clinical oncology, but lacks pre-clinical models of the human immune system and human cancer to investigate new modalities and limitations/toxicities of treatment regimens. The ability to grow human tumors in immunodeficient mice (so-called patient-derived xenografts, or PDXs) allows researchers to work directly with human cancer tissue in a controlled setting. However, PDX models are limited by their lack of an intact immune system. The broad objective of this proposal is to validate an in vivo model to evaluate human tumors in the context of a complete and intact human immune system in a completely personalized and autologous fashion. Herein, we propose to: (1) validate the ability to establish humanized mice from patients with melanoma; (2) evaluate tumor growth and lymphocyte development in autologous human melanoma tumors established in humanized mice; and (3) validate the ability of this humanized system to serve as a model for cancer immunotherapy treatment response and toxicity. In each of these areas, we will leverage our multi- institutional team's individual expertise along with our institutional infrastructure to maximize the success of the experimental aims. Furthermore, we will participate in the Oncology Models Forum and utilize the NCIP Hub resources to ensure that the methodology, data, and biologic model systems that result from this project are made widely available to the general research community for future, hypothesis-driven research. Taken together, the studies described in this research proposal will meet multiple goals and address several unmet needs identified in this grant opportunity, thus significantly enhancing the applicability of a fully autologous and immunocompetent precision model system for use in translational oncology research.

However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes. This work will therefore help realize the promise of precision medicine in neuro- oncology.

project	1R01CA204314-01A1	R01CA204314	9239071	2017	Mechanism-based strategies to target oncogenic BRAF signaling	Grant	Abstract BRAF kinase is frequently found mutated in human tumors and in the majority of melanomas. RAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib improved survival of melanoma patients with BRAF(V600E) tumors. Unfortunate- ly, responses are usually temporary, followed by development of resistance, most commonly due to ineffective inhibition of RAF and reactivation of ERK signaling in the presence of the drug. In addition, RAF inhibitors in- duce second site tumors, due to RAS-dependent paradoxical activation of RAF and downstream ERK signaling in normal cells. Outside of melanoma, RAF inhibitors showed limited efficacy in patients colorectal and thyroid BRAF(V600E) tumors, also due to ineffective inhibition of RAF/ERK signaling in these tumors. More recently, combinations of RAF and MEK inhibitors showed improved efficacy compared to RAF inhibitor monotherapy, but resistance eventually emerges as well. Resistance mechanisms identified to the RAF/MEK inhibitor combi- nation are similar to the ones identified for RAF inhibitor monotherapy, suggesting that ineffective inhibition of RAF is a critical limiting factor in both contexts. There is thus a pressing need for improved therapeutic strate- gies targeting oncogenic BRAF, such that durable responses and minimal side effects can be achieved. Our previous work showed that regulation of BRAF kinase by dimerization determines both the development of re- sistance to currently used RAF inhibitors and inhibitor-induced RAF paradoxical activation, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Recently, next generation RAF inhibitors with different structural and biochemical properties have entered preclinical and clinical development, but the most appropriate clinical context for their use is unknown. The goal of this proposal is to accomplish a detailed understanding of the mechanisms governing the targeting of oncogenic BRAF by small molecules inhibitors and to use this knowledge in order to design more effective RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies. More specifically, we will 1) characterize the mechanistic basis of resistance to RAF inhibitors due to BRAF dimerization by linking the conformational changes induced by inhibitor binding to BRAF to the biochemical effects of the inhibitor, 2) gain a detailed understanding of the biochemical mechanism of paradoxical RAF activation by inhibitors in cells with wild-type BRAF and 3) identify effective RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies for tumors with dimeric BRAF that would overcome RAF dimer-mediated intrinsic or acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors. The mech- anistic insights gained by the proposed experiments will enable the rational design of more effective small mol- ecule inhibitors and RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies targeting oncogenic BRAF signaling, with mini- mal side effects and prolonged time to resistance.

While Ewing sarcoma is relatively rare, the biology of this disease is also relevant to non-Ewing sarcomas, and to other cancer subtypes, due to the presence of the EWS/FLI translocation, the driving event in this disease. Similar translocations involving ETS transcription factors occur in other malignancies, including prostate cancer. Thus, understanding the biology of Ewing sarcoma may provide insight into many cancer types. We will investigate the role of secondary genetic events in the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma. These secondary events have been identified through next-generation sequencing of primary tumors and cell lines. Specifically, we will evaluate the role of STAG2 in mediating epigenetic and transcriptional changes induced by the driving oncogene in Ewing sarcoma, EWS/FLI. In Aim 1, we will use genomic approaches (RNAseq, ChIPseq, WGS, etc.) to assess the mechanistic role of STAG2 in the regulation of chromatin architecture, transcription, and aneuploidy in Ewing cells. In Aim 2, we will study the role of STAG2 in progression, maintenance and metastasis in Ewing sarcoma, using functional studies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In Aim 3, we will determine whether there is a synthetic lethal dependency on STAG1 when STAG2 is absent in Ewing sarcoma cells. Our central hypothesis is that STAG2 loss plays a key role in the epigenetic reprogramming that drives the oncogenic function of EWS/FLI.

Understanding the genetic basis of response and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors are critical for improving outcomes with current agents and for developing new ones. Patients can undergo dramatic remissions after treatment while others reap no benefit. Furthermore, the immune phenotype shows substantial temperospatial variability and is influenced by multiple variables. The rationale of this project is that there is a fundamental genetic basis underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors that is poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrates that response to immune checkpoint blockade is strongly determined by the tumor mutation landscape and dictated by a specific neoantigen repertoire. We will apply a conceptually and technically innovative, systematic, multidisciplinary, and highly collaborative approach to elucidate the neoantigen landscape underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our contribution here is expected to provide unparalleled mechanistic detail on how immune checkpoint inhibitors function and to provide biomarkers to identify patients who will benefit from PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, building on data showing that resistance may be mediated by immune pressure and immunoediting, we will shed light into how resistance to these drugs develop, providing definitive evidence for causal mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity. Should our work succeed, we envision substantial utility for similar studies for other cancers. Such an understanding will provide great insight into the mechanisms underlying how immune checkpoint blockade works, provide much needed precise biomarkers, and establish a foundation to develop more effective immunotherapy.

MIND involves injection of epithelial cells derived from patient DCIS into the mammary ducts of immunocompromised mice. DCIS MIND xenografts exhibited the full spectrum of human DCIS including invasive progression. Histology of xenografted DCIS lesions that progressed to invasion showed disruption of basement membrane and myoepithelial layer by the invasive cells, retraction of myoepithelial layer and microinvasion. Therefore, the DCIS MIND model is a valuable tool for studying the early molecular mechanisms underlying DCIS invasive progression in a manner that is individualized to each patient DCIS. This proposal that is aimed at further improving the translation application of MIND models by mimicking the natural microenvironment of human DCIS in mice, is directly responsive to this FOA. The following specific aims (SA) are proposed: SA 1) Humanize mouse mammary fat pads with patient derived immortalized fibroblasts and study effects on DCIS progression to invasion, pathology and biomarker expression. The DCIS xenografts ± humanized fat pads will be assessed for pathology, biomarker expression and progression to invasion. We expect the xenografted DCIS with humanized mammary fat pads to more closely resemble patient DCIS with respect to pathology and biomarker expression. We also expect the humanized fat pads to enhance DCIS invasive progression in a fraction of DCIS MIND xenografts. Additionally, we will correlate DCIS epithelial cell inherent molecular aberrations (gene expression and/or genomic aberrations) to DCIS invasive behavior in the DCIS MIND xenografts. SA 2) Reconstitute the mouse hematopoietic system with patient derived immune cells and study effects on DCIS progression to invasion, pathology and biomarker expression. The experimental procedure involves reconstitution of mouse hematopoietic system with patient derived immune cells. We will utilize MISTRG mice, which are highly permissive for human hematopoiesis including support of the development and function of monocytes, macrophages and NK cells. DCIS xenografts ± patient derived immune system will be assessed for human immune cell infiltration to DCIS, DCIS pathology and invasive behavior as described in SA 1. We will correlate the recruitment of specific immune cells to DCIS as well as DCIS epithelial cell inherent molecular aberrations (gene expression and/or genomic aberrations) to DCIS invasive behavior in the MIND xenografts.

Obesity associates with increased risk and worse prognosis of many malignancies including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Obesity induces a pro-inflammatory state both locally in adipose tissue and systemically in visceral organs such as the pancreas. PDAC is a highly desmoplastic/fibrotic tumor in which angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) signaling activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), contributing to solid stress (the mechanical force exerted by the solid components of the tumor). We have recently shown that obesity- induced inflammation worsens the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME), and compromises perfusion, oxygenation and chemotherapy in PDACs (Cancer Discovery 2016). Our preliminary data suggest that obesity increases tumor stiffness and solid stress, which compress blood vessels and hinder the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic therapy. The desmoplastic reaction also promotes pro-survival signaling in cancer cells. We also found crosstalk between fibrotic (AT1) and inflammatory (interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) signaling pathways in PDACs in obese mice. These abnormalities also promote immunosuppression. Building on these exciting findings, we will further dissect molecular and mechanical mechanisms and develop novel strategies to overcome these obesity-induced biomechanical barriers to successful therapy in PDACs. We hypothesize that targeting AT1 and/or IL-1β will alleviate obesity-induced desmoplasia and reprogram the immune TME. To this end, we will study spontaneous and orthotopic PDAC mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) in both primary and liver metastasis settings. These PDAC models have successfully recapitulated clinical disease. We will characterize mechanical properties of PDACs in DIO using a newly developed approach together with the assessment of biochemical and cellular microenvironment. We will assess the effect of novel TME-activated AT1 blockers (TMA-ARBs), which allow delivery of high-dose ARBs to tumors while avoiding systemic hypotension We will also study the FDA approved IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) on obesity-altered PDAC biomechanics, and on inflammatory cytokines and cells in obesity (Aim 1). We will evaluate if TMA-ARBs/ IL-1Ra can reprogram immune TME in PDACs with obesity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how elevated solid stress and stiffness alter tumor cells and host stromal cells using in vitro engineered microenvironments with the results being tested in vivo (Aim 3). We anticipate that TMA-ARBs and/or IL-1Ra will alleviate desmoplasia and inflammation in PDACs in obese mice, reprogram ECM and immune TME and facilitate both conventional chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blocker immunotherapy. If successful, these studies will lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for obese PDAC patients. These novel treatments can be rapidly translated into the clinic based on our track record of successful clinical translation in collaboration with outstanding clinicians.

project	1R01CA210259-01A1	R01CA210259	9333520	2017	Using Technology to Scale-Up an Occupational Sun Protection Policy Program	Grant	A key goal in the Affordable Care Act is building a national culture of prevention through workplace health and safety initiatives. To achieve this goal, methods for scaling up evidence-based programs from research to wide- scale dissemination are needed to help balance effectiveness and cost. In many cases, there are pressures to reduce scale-up costs but at the expense of lower program implementation and effectiveness. A scale-up method that sacrifices effectiveness but reduces costs and reaches a larger number of employers may be acceptable. We will model the effectiveness and cost trade-off, along with the extent and representativeness of reach, when scaling up our evidence-based occupational sun protection intervention, Sun Safe Workplaces (SSW), for national distribution. The intervention, which relies on personal contact with managers and in- person employee training (SSW-IP), created large improvements in comprehensive workplace sun safety (i.e., policy adoption and employee education) in a randomized controlled trial. We will compare the existing in- person program delivery methods (SSW-IP) to a lower-cost dissemination method that utilizes Internet technology (SSW-T), i.e., virtual meetings, social networking, online training, and program materials. The aims of the research are to: 1) estimate the program reach (number and representativeness) and implementation rates (i.e., adoption of policies and delivery of education on occupational sun protection) achieved by the SSW- IP and SSW-T in a model of national distribution to public safety and public works industries; 2) estimate the costs associated with the SSW-IP and SSW-T (i.e., intervention costs and induced employer costs) and compare the estimated program benefits (i.e., policy and education) to cost; and 3) estimate the effect and cost- effectiveness of SSW-IP and SSW-T in secondary outcomes of a) changes in workplace environments and procedures for sun safety and b) workers’ sun safety practices. In a 5-year project, SSW-T will be created by redesigning our very effective SSW-IP methods to use the latest web conferencing, social networking, and online training technology for dissemination. The implementation rates (defined as policy adoption and education delivery) and costs associated with SSW-IP (n=50 employers) and SSW-T (n=150 employers) will be modeled in a randomized two-group pretest-posttest design, enrolling a national sample of 200 employers (i.e., firefighting departments and state departments of transportation). Unlike traditional randomized trials, the primary analysis will be of cost effectiveness to test the hypothesis that SSW-T can be delivered cost-effectively to an expanded group of worksites producing a lower implementation rate than SSW-IP but at substantially lower cost. Secondary analyses will compare the two scale-up strategies on implementation rate, differences in rate by employer groups (e.g., size and region), changes to workplace environment/procedures, and employee sun safety practices. The findings will have high impact by helping public health practitioners select the best strategy for scaling up evidence-based workplace health and safety programs to achieve this ACA goal.

Paradoxically, although estrogens stimulate breast cancers, risk rises markedly after menopause, when estrogens decrease. After menopause, estradiol falls and estrone is produced largely in fat by aromatase. Obesity women have high estrone, and both obesity and high estrone, but not estradiol, increase ER+ breast cancer risk after menopause. Low intra-tumor levels of enzymes converting estrone into estradiol, and elevation of enzymes that produce estrone both confer worse ER+ breast cancer outcome.  Obesity mediates chronic inflammation through NF-κB driven cytokine expression. We showed contact between invading breast cancer cells and obese adipose tissue induces pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cell types that stimulate cancer stem cells (CSC) and drive metastasis. Our data suggest that cytokine induction after breast fat:cancer cell contact is estrogen:ER dependent, since blocking estrogen synthesis with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, reduced cytokine induction upon co-culture. While estradiol is known to oppose NF-κB mediated inflammation, the role of estrone in inflammation is not known and may differ from that of estradiol. We will study how estrone and estradiol, and changes in the ratios thereof before and after- menopause, may influence NF-κB activity and the pro-inflammatory state in obese postmenopausal women.  We hypothesize that increased estrone:estradiol ratio after menopause shifts ER from an NF-κB co- repressor to a co-activator to up-regulate cytokines in obese adipocytes and cancer cells that drive CSC expansion and metastasis. We also posit that enzymes that convert estradiol to estrone may contribute to the poor outcome of ER+ cancers in obesity. Aim 1 will test if estradiol:ER decreases, estrone:ER increases or different estradiol:estrone ratios alter ER effects on NF-κB mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene drivers of CSCs in ER+ breast cancer cells. To test in Aim 2 if estrone cooperates with obesity to drive ER+ breast cancer initiation and growth, we will co-culture human ER+ breast cancer cells with mammary adipocytes from women with different body mass index (BMI) +/- aromatase inhibition and test consequences on cytokine levels and CSC. We will also implant syngeneic breast cancers into lean or obese wild-type or aromatase knock-out mice to elucidate if host estrone mediates tumor promoting effects of obesity. Aim 3 will test if overexpression of HSD17B14, that converts estradiol to estrone, increases ER+ breast cancer cytokine expression and CSC in vitro, and increases tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo. We will also compare levels of estradiol/estrone interconversion enzymes in breast adipocytes and cancers from lean, overweight and obese women. A better understanding of the roles of estradiol and estrone may lead to new strategies for breast cancer prevention and treatment, and to changes in hormone replacement therapies. Shifting toward a higher estradiol: estrone ratio in serum or in breast cancer cells may prove to have therapeutic potential.

Although surgery is effective in early stage cancers, the median survival of women with advanced endometrial cancer is less than one year, and in the past 30 years there have been no major improvements in the treatment of advanced disease.  Neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy significantly increases long‐term survival, and there are no therapies (targeted or conventional) effective against metastatic disease.  Endometrial cancer research has lagged behind other cancers in grant allocation and progress relative to its clinical impact.  More recently, systematic genome‐wide sequencing efforts, such as the National Cancer Institute’s The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have brought the endometrial cancer genetic landscape into much clearer focus.  These studies have yielded many previously unsuspected endometrial cancer tumor suppressor genes (such as FBXW7) altered in a large percentage of cases, and thus of obvious clinical and research significance.  Cancers are complex amalgamations of various cell types that interact in myriad ways not only with one another, but also with the host organism.  Hence, many features of cancer cannot be modelled in vitro.  Consequently, in vivo genetic animal models are needed to further our understanding of these newly‐discovered genetic driver events in endometrial cancer.  Genetically‐engineered mouse models of endometrial cancer have lagged considerably relative to other types of cancer, and such models remain to be generated for most of the frequent endometrial cancer driver events.  One significant limitation has been the lack of fully optimized in vivo genetic models and the genetic tools to generate such models.  We propose to build upon prior efforts and employ a general, validated strategy to build a suite of genetic tools useful for the generation and characterization of diverse mouse models of invasive and lethal endometrial cancer.  The wide availability of this fully‐credentialed suite of genetic tools will bring new investigators into the field and greatly catalyze the development and use of clinically‐relevant mouse models of endometrial cancer.  These models and the diverse array of translational investigations they will foster will lead to new insights into the biology of these endometrial cancer driver genes and also aid in the identification of potential Achilles’ heels that can be exploited for treatment.    	Ablation;Age;Alleles;Animal Cancer Model;Animal Genetics;Animal Model;Animals;Biological;Biological Models;Biology;Cancer Model;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Research;Complex;Credentialing;Development;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Endometrial;Endometrial Carcinoma;Endometrial Neoplasms;Epithelial Cells;Epithelium;Estrogens;Event;FBXW7 gene;Female;Fostering;Future;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Recombination;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Human;Image;Imagery;Incidence;Investigation;Lead;Life;Luciferases;Maintenance;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Modeling;Monitor;Mosaicism;Mouse Strains;Mutate;Mutation;National Cancer Institute;Neoplasm Metastasis;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organism;PTEN gene;Pattern;Penetrance;Performance;Proteins;Proteomics;Radiation therapy;Reporter;Research Personnel;Specificity;System;Testing;Tetanus Helper Peptide;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Tissues;Translational Research;Tumor Promotion;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Ubiquitination;Uterus;Variant;Woman;advanced disease;anticancer research;base;cancer genetics;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell type;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;combinatorial;exome sequencing;flexibility;genome-wide;improved;in vitro Model;in vivo;in vivo Model;insight;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;oncogene addiction;pre-clinical;prevent;prognostic;reproductive tract;response;targeted treatment;theranostics;tool;translational cancer research;translational study;tumor;ubiquitin-protein ligase	UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER	DALLAS	TX	UNITED STATES	DIEGO H CASTRILLON	DCB	Neeraja  Sathyamoorthy	570932	$500k to $749k	570932	3-Mar-2017	3-Mar-2017	28-Feb-2020	PAR-16-059	Moonshot

People with Lynch syndrome are also at increased risk for endometrial, ovarian, gastric, small bowel, and renal cancers. Importantly, well-established clinical guidelines with strong evidence exist for cancer treatment, screening, and prevention in individuals with LS. Identification of individuals with LS is accomplished through a variety of techniques, including family and medical history evaluation, computational models, or tumor testing. The systematic screening of all colorectal tumors for LS was first recommended by the Evaluation of Genetic Application in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) working group in 2009 and has been designated high priority by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine working group and by the Blue Ribbon Panel. The potential public health impact to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality of this intervention supports this priority, as effective implementation of LS screening will help meet the goals of the Cancer Moonshot as well as demonstrate the promise of precision medicine. Currently, implementation of LS screening in healthcare systems remains suboptimal for a variety of reasons. LS screening involves the coordination of multiple departments and individuals across an organization, which is often difficult in large, complex, healthcare systems. Therefore, the overarching goal of this project is to utilize tools from implementation science to describe, explain, and compare decision making and other variations in LS screening implementation across multiple healthcare systems to create and evaluate in a real world setting an organizational toolkit to facilitate implementation of LS screening. Our specific aims are to (1) Describe variation in LS screening implementation across multiple healthcare systems; then (2) Explain practice variation and determine factors associated with optimal implementation; and (3) Determine the relative effectiveness, efficiency, and costs of different LS screening protocols by healthcare system; and finally to (4) Develop and test in a natural environment an organizational toolkit for LS screening. This toolkit will enable effective implementation of LS screening programs; ultimately preventing needless suffering of patients and their family members from preventable cancers, decreasing waste in healthcare system costs, and informing strategies to facilitate the promise of precision medicine.

Mice can also be genetically engineered to study specific oncogenic pathways. Given the many positives associated with murine models, the vast majority of pre-clinical anti-cancer therapeutic studies are performed in a mouse. Unfortunately, the vast majority of oncology drugs (~94%) that are effective in murine tumor studies will ultimately fail when tested in humans. These failures cost billions of dollars and waste physician and patient resources. Clearly, current preclinical mouse tumor models are not accurately predicting a patients’ response to therapy. Thus current mouse models need to be improved to more accurately reflect human disease. Each of the currently available mouse models of human cancer has distinct strengths, but also critical flaws. One critical flaw in all available preclinical models is the lack of human tumor stroma. However, work from our group and others demonstrates that human tumor stroma is a critical component of the human tumor microenvironment which promotes human tumor growth, metastasis, suppresses anti-tumor immunity, and induces therapeutic resistance. Our long term goal is to develop a human tumor model that will, by better representing human tumors, will better cancer therapeutic response seen in human clinical trials. We hypothesize that a human tumor model with both human cancer cells and human tumor stroma will better represent primary human disease. As such, it will be a better/more stringent model for preclinical drug screening that could ultimately prevent a drug which is destined to fail from being used in clinical trials. We further hypothesize that human tumor stroma will better maintain tumor cell heterogeneity over time to more accurately reflect the natural evolution of therapeutic resistance. Finally such a model will be ideal for evaluating the impact of human tumor stroma on novel immune cell therapies. We propose to use a combination of human adult stem cells and cancer associated stem cells to create human tumor model with both human cancer cells and stromal cells. We will perform extensive histological and molecular profiling to confirm this model reflects primary tumor. Finally, we will (i) evaluate the models ability to predict patient response to disease in a retrospective study and (ii) assess the use of this model to evaluate novel immunotherapies using a novel CAR T-cell construct targeting ovarian cancer cells.

Pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasias (PanINs) represent an early, localized developmental stage of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), when curative surgical resection remains feasible. Understanding features of PDA precursor lesions like PanINs could generate new strategies for early PDA diagnosis and intervention. We have created a novel system for genetic modification and growth of primary human pancreatic cells to reconstitute the development of lesions with molecular and pathological features of human PanINs. Upon orthotopic transplantation these immortalized clones produce stable human induced pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasias (hiPanINs). Moreover, these PanIN lesions appear to be stable: after 6 months, they do not invade locally or metastasize. Here we propose to validate and optimize this new system for generating stable human PanIN-like lesions to enhance its uses for addressing unmet translational needs. In Aim 1 we propose to generate new hiPanIN clones whose mutational spectrum matches that found in native PanIN and PDA development. We will also assess prioritized biomarkers identified in the hiPanIN system in native human PanIN and PDA specimens. In Aim 2 we propose collaborative studies to test whether pancreatitis, further genetic modification, or extrinsic signals relevant to PDA can promote invasive or metastatic PDA in the hiPanIN orthotopic transplantation model. In summary our proposal is highly responsive to the FOA (PAR 16-059). We have created a “novel model to fill critical gaps in translational requirements” using “human and mammalian oncology models and their genetics”, and proposed studies to “ensure their appropriateness for addressing unmet translational needs.”	3-Dimensional;Address;Alpha Cell;Archives;Basic Science;Biological Markers;Biological Models;CDKN2A gene;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cell Line;Cells;Characteristics;Chemoprevention;Clinical;Clone Cells;Desmoplastic;Development;Diagnosis;Ductal Epithelial Cell;Ensure;Epithelial;Excision;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Growth;Human;Immunohistochemistry;Induced Mutation;Intervention;Intervention Studies;KRAS2 gene;Lesion;MADH4 gene;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pancreas;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia;Pancreatic duct;Pancreatitis;Pathologic;Prevention;Protein Analysis;Reporting;Research Personnel;Response Latencies;Signal Transduction;Specimen;System;TP53 gene;Testing;Therapeutic Studies;Translational Research;Transplantation;Validation;actionable mutation;anticancer research;base;biomarker discovery;candidate marker;developmental genetics;diagnostic biomarker;effective therapy;molecular marker;novel;oncology;pre-clinical;preclinical development;preclinical study;reconstitution;response;transcriptome sequencing;translational study	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	STANFORD	CA	UNITED STATES	Seung K Kim	DCB	GRACE S.

This caveat is particularly relevant for melanoma, given the pivotal role the immune system plays in its development. To address these limitations, we plan to study melanoma biology and therapy in a humanized mouse (HM) model. We initially developed a mis-matched HM (mHM; tumor and hematopoietic stem cells [HSCs] from different sources), and now have generated an autologous HM (aHM; tumor, HSCs and mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] from the same patient). In HM bearing tumors the human immune and mesenchymal cells from the patient's bone marrow homed into the growing tumor, migrated into the pre- existing mouse stroma, and interacted with the human cancer cells. Tumors grown in HM more closely resembled the originator tumor than those grown in non-HM mice, and the drift in gene expression caused by prior passaging was partially reversed. Signaling in key immune and stroma pathways was more prominent and closely resembled the originator patient in HM vs. non-HM models. The immune cells mounted effective tumor-specific immune responses, mediated by human immune cells including T cells. Significantly, immune responses upon immune therapies in the HM melanoma models showed a correlation with the patient's therapy results. Two salient and under-studied issues limit the wider application of HM: The relevance of the degree of tumor and immune matching, which can affect the faithfulness of immune response, and that can only be appreciated by comparing mHM and aHM. A second criticism to HM is xenogenic education of human T cells on mouse thymic cells, resulting from the lack of a functional human thymus in such models. In this application we will further address the relevance of an autologous versus mis-matched HM to test which approach gives rise to a more representative model of melanoma; secondly, using the same precursor cells from the patient we will reconstitute a functional thymus. The overarching goal of this proposal is to conduct a co-clinical trial where we will accomplish the following: 1) prospectively generate and characterize aHM and mHM from 20 melanoma patients, 2) test which approach yields a more representative melanoma HM model, 3) test in HM the immune drugs (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA4] and programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1] inhibitors) that each patient received and correlate with the clinical data, 4) identify the mechanisms involved in resistance to CTLA4/PD-1 inhibitors; and finally as an exploratory Aim in selected cases, we will 5) generate thymic epithelium from the same patient's HSCs that will result in HM with a fully autologous melanoma, thymus and immune system, thus enabling immune cell education in a strictly human context. This project will advance our understanding of the tumor-host interaction in melanoma and human cancer, by better characterizing the interplay between melanoma cells and the immune and stroma systems, leading to the discovery of new approaches to improve personalization of therapy and improve outcomes.

project	1R01CA214530-01	R01CA214530	9284619	2017	Mis-Implementation in Cancer Prevention and Control	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Through application of existing knowledge, much of the cancer burden is preventable. State- level practitioners are in ideal positions to affect programs and policies related to cancer control. Mis- implementation refers to ending effective programs and policies or continuing ineffective ones. Greater attention to mis-implementation should lead to use of effective interventions and more efficient expenditure of resources, which in the long term, will lead to positive cancer outcomes. GOAL: This proposal seeks to describe the extent of cancer control mis-implementation and to identify leverage points for addressing mis-implementation in the United States. AIMS AND METHODS: This is a three-phase study that takes a comprehensive approach, leading to the elucidation of tactics for addressing mis-implementation. Phase 1: The first aim seeks to assess the extent to which mis-implementation is occurring among state cancer control programs in public health. This initial phase will involve a survey of 800 practitioners representing all states. The programs represented will span the full continuum of cancer control (from prevention to survivorship). Phase 2: Using data from Phase 1 to identify organizations in which mis-implementation is high or low, we will conduct eight comparative case studies to understand contextual differences. These case studies will highlight lessons learned about mis-implementation and identify hypothesized drivers. Phase 3: The 3rd aim seeks to build agent-based models to identify dynamic interactions between individual, organizational, and contextual (external) factors driving mis-implementation. Agent-based modeling will be used to determine the most effective potential approaches for reducing mis- implementation. We will translate and disseminate findings from Phases 1-3 to practitioners and practice- related stakeholders in order to support the reduction of mis-implementation. All study phases will rely on an Advisory Group of public health practitioners and close collaboration with key practice partners. INNOVATIONS AND IMPACT: This study is innovative and impactful because it will: 1) be the first to refine and further develop reliable and valid measures of mis-implementation of public health programs; 2) bring together a strong, transdisciplinary team with significant expertise in practice-based research; 3) use agent- based modeling to address cancer control implementation; and 4) use a participatory, evidence-based, stakeholder-driven approach that will identify key leverage points for addressing mis-implementation among state public health programs. This research is expected to result in a replicable model that can significantly impact mis-implementation in cancer control and can be applied to other health areas.

project	1R01CA214669-01A1	R01CA214669	9380179	2017	Exploring a promising design for the next generation time-of-flight PET detector	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract We propose to study a promising candidate for the next generation time-of-flight (TOF)-positron emission tomography (PET) annihilation photon detector. By enabling significant increases in the reconstructed image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), TOF-PET has demonstrated substantial clinical impact on the visualization and quantification of molecular signatures of cancer in patients. In particular it has been shown to improve image quality and accuracy in count starved and contrast limited lesion detection scenarios. The effective photon sensitivity boost provided by TOF can also be exploited to significantly reduce injected dose to the patient and/or study duration, factors that would make PET more practical, cost-effective, and safe for a variety of clinical cancer imaging applications. Thus, studies that further advance the TOF-PET technique, and photon sensitivity in general, are highly worthwhile. The key to better TOF-PET performance is to improve the annihilation photon pair coincidence time resolution (CTR) measured between any two detection elements in the system, which has been a focus of research for the past two decades. Current commercially available PET systems achieve a CTR of roughly 350 to 800 ps full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). A goal of this proposal is to employ a novel scintillation detection configuration in order to achieve 100 ps FWHM CTR, without compromising other important performance parameters. This novel configuration also enables another capability not possible with the conventional PET detector: The ability to measure the energy and three-dimensional (3D) position of one or more annihilation photon interactions in the detector. Owing to the fact that most incoming 511 keV photons undergo inter-crystal Compton scatter in the detectors, we can exploit the kinematics of that process to estimate the photon angle-of-incidence. If successful, that capability enables us to accurately position the first interaction of such multi-crystal events, but also offers the potential to retain a high fraction of photon events that are normally rejected by a conventional PET system, such as single (unpaired) photons, random coincidences, tissue-scatter coincidences, and multiple (>2) photon coincidences. Since these normally-discarded events are over 10-fold more probable than true coincidence events in a standard PET study, this 3D position sensitive detector shows promise as another method to greatly boost photon sensitivity. If successful, this resulting substantial photon sensitivity increase, along with the substantial image SNR enhancement possible with 100 ps CTR would enable PET to be more sensitive, accurate, and practical for cancer imaging. In this project we will design and develop these next-generation detectors, integrate these modules into a prototype partial-ring PET system, and compare image quality and accuracy available with this partial-ring system to a state-of-the-art whole body TOF-PET system currently installed in our imaging clinic.

project	1R01CA215034-01	R01CA215034	9285367	2017	Comparative Effectiveness of Fecal Immunochemical Tests with Optical Colonoscopy	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the U.S., with nearly 50,000 deaths each year. Since CRC develops over a number of years from precursor lesions called polyps, it is largely detectable and preventable in early stages. As these polyps become larger, they, like most CRCs, tend to bleed, which is the rationale for the use of fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) to detect both polyps and cancers early, while they are curable. However, early screening and detection is much less common than it could be, with about 43% of eligible individuals unscreened. Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) are a type of FOBT that can be a sensitive, specific, and low- cost alternative to colonoscopy for CRC screening. Modeling studies have shown that for population screening, a strategy of annual FIT testing from age of 50 to 75 years results in an equal number of life-years gained as compared with colonoscopy every 10 years. However, about 90% of screening in the U.S. is done with colonoscopy, the most expensive and invasive screening test. FITs are far less costly and largely replacing the guaiac test in CRC screening programs internationally, where only individuals with positive results are referred for a colonoscopy. Studies done on FITs in other countries often used FITs not available in the U.S. or studied high-risk populations; thus, results are not applicable in the U.S. It is critical to determine the FIT(s) with the best test characteristics in order to implement successful FIT-based screening programs in this country. It is estimated that 24 million more individuals will need to be screened by 2018 to reach the “80% by 2018” goal set by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to compare the test characteristics of three CLIA-waived FITs and two automated FITs, using colonoscopy as the gold standard. The rationale for this proposed study is that, for almost all of the FITs currently marketed in the U.S., there is no evidence of the accuracy claimed. Our aims are:  Aim 1: To assess the diagnostic accuracy for advanced colorectal neoplasms of three of the most  commonly used CLIA-waived FITs and two automated FITs, using colonoscopy as the gold standard.  Aim 2: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two quantitative FITs using receiver operating characteristic  (ROC) analysis.  Aim 3: To assess factors associated with false positive and false negative FIT results for each device. These findings will provide essential information about FITs with the best test characteristics for future expanded use of FIT, critically important to achieving our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality from CRC. FITs are more acceptable to patients, will allow higher screening rates, and will reduce costs as compared with a screening strategy based on colonoscopy as the primary initial screening method.

Despite the known benefits of AETs, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. Furthermore, lower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality outcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more effective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and mortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have targeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a statistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web- enabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms will be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider communication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot trial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly reminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control group (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding the intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to develop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term effects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample powered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1) an “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a “Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET adherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning symptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable alerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long- term adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures, including AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will provide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the “Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience.

Although we have driven down population smoking rates, and with them, cancer rates, roughly 28% of the socioeconomically disadvantaged still smoke regularly. Low-income (L-I) smokers also develop cancer at higher rates and struggle more to quit than do higher-income smokers. These disparities in tobacco use and its burdens must be addressed. Highly effective cessation treatment services that can be delivered remotely, flexibly, and conveniently with few cost or logistical barriers have the potential to achieve this aim. Tobacco quitline and SmokefreeTXT services are such treatment resources with demonstrated attractiveness and reach among L-I smokers. The current proposal will use an efficient factorial design to evaluate 4 smoking cessation interventions with vast reach and dissemination potential. The target population will be N=1,408 Medicaid-eligible or uninsured smokers who have recently enrolled in the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL), but who report continued smoking 4- months following engagement in standard WTQL services. These treatment non-responders will be invited to participate in an experiment that will randomize them to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following 4 factors in a 2X2X2X2 design: WTQL counseling intensity (1 session vs. 4 sessions), medication intensity (2-week nicotine patch monotherapy vs. 4-week nicotine patch and lozenge combination therapy), a supportive text messaging program (SmokefreeTXT vs. none), and financial incentives (rewards of up to $150 for treatment engagement vs. no treatment incentives). The primary outcome will be 26-week biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence. Analyses will examine the main and interactive effects of these 4 treatment components on 26- week and secondary abstinence outcomes to identify the components and combinations of components that significantly enhance success in quitting in this high-risk population. This experiment will identify especially effective combinations of highly scalable interventions of modest cost and few barriers that could be disseminated nationally to reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking cessation among those seeking to quit. Additional analyses will: compare intervention components and promising component combinations in terms of cost-effectiveness, examine whether or not treatment engagement differs across component combinations, examine baseline variables that may moderate treatment response, and identify mediators of treatment effects on abstinence outcomes. Because delivery of the study interventions can be centralized through established and efficient services (WTQL and SmokefreeTXT), the potential for both scalable dissemination and cost-effectiveness of the interventions tested is great. The proposed research will help identify ways to reduce tobacco cessation disparities in L-I smokers who have tried to quit smoking but relapsed and may benefit from improved assistance.

Project summary/abstract PROJECT: Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women who have performed self-collection Cervical cancer is a serious public health problem reflecting social and gender inequalities in health. It is the third cause of cancer death among women in the world, with more than 85% of cases occurring in developing countries. Currently, the development of new technologies based on HPV DNA detection allows HPV self- collection, increasing screening coverage. In a self-collection based strategy, triage becomes a key step in the prevention process, as it is the first method to identify HPV+ women who will need diagnostic and treatment procedures. However, high adherence to triage is difficult to obtain, which is not surprising given that adherence to follow-up and treatment is a generalized problem in cervical cancer programs. Specific aims of the study are: 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests compared to usual care. 2. To evaluate the implementation strategy and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the multi-component mHealth intervention. The research study design will follow the structure of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial, and will use mix-method approach. A cluster randomized trial including 200 CHWs (clusters) and 4000 women will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to cytology triage at 120 days after positive HPV testing. The mHealth intervention will include SMS messages sent to HPV+ women to inform them when results are available, and subsequent SMS messages as reminders. In addition, for those HPV+ women who did not had a triage cytology result within 60 days of the HPV test result, CHWs will receive an e-mail and SMS message so they can contact these women during home visits for specific counseling and support. For the implementation evaluation, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to guide qualitative data collection and analysis of factors that influence implementation. RE-AIM will be used to assess the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance of the Intervention. Results of this project will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase triage of HPV+ women, but it could be adapted to increase compliance of diagnoses/ treatment of cervical cancer and other health problems. Findings from the implementation evaluation will be highly applicable to programs that use or are planning to incorporate HPV self-collection in different settings and countries. In addition, the use of CFIR and RE-AIM in this innovative study will serve as a model of work, constituting an important advance in the use of Implementation Science in the Region.

project	1R01CA221290-01	R01CA221290	9403804	2017	Metabolic reprogramming of Tregs in tumor immunity	Grant	Program Description/Abstract Metabolic reprogramming is a fundamental process underlying the growth of cancer cells and activated lymphocytes. These rapidly dividing cells markedly upregulate aerobic glycolysis (Warburg metabolism) and also reprogram mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to support the energy and growth demands. Moreover, mTOR signaling is a central regulator of anabolic metabolism in cancer cells and lymphocytes. While Warburg and mitochondrial metabolism and mTOR signaling are being actively studied, we are just beginning to appreciate the involvement of other biosynthetic programs such as de novo lipid synthesis (lipogenesis). Emerging evidence highlights that cancer immunotherapy is a powerful tool to combat cancers, but immune tolerance mediated by immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) represents a major obstacle for effective anti-tumor immunity. Although mTOR was generally considered a crucial negative regulator of Tregs, our genetic studies have revealed that mTORC1 is a pivotal positive determinant of Treg function by linking immune signals to the lipogenic program. In our preliminary studies, disruption of the lipogenic program in Tregs rendered the mice to reject tumor cells but did not cause obvious autoimmune disorders under steady state. We hypothesize that lipogenic program contributes to Treg suppressive activity in the tumor microenvironment, which could represent a novel target for cancer immunotherapy. We will test this hypothesis by establishing the roles of Treg lipogenic programs in tumor immunity, and determining the metabolic and signaling basis whereby lipogenesis programs Treg functions. We predict these studies will establish a new paradigm on our understanding of lipogenic program in Tregs and how this impinges upon tumor immunity. Insights gained from this project will likely lead to innovative strategies on cancer immunotherapy by capitalizing on metabolic reprogramming of Tregs.

project	1R01CA226776-01	R01CA226776	9497626	2018	Novel Uses of PI3K-inhibitors for the Treatment of advanced PIK3CA-mutant Breast Cancer	Grant	Summary. Our proposal addresses the problem of advanced, PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. We propose a role for PI3K-inhibitors in this disease at a stage when the disease no longer responds to endocrine manipulation, cdk4/6- or mTOR-inhibition and when patients typically receive palliative chemotherapy. These pre-treated tumors frequently display increased glucose avidity as evidenced by high SUVmax values in 18FDG- PET-scans and highly active glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect. 30 - 40% of breast tumors have activating PIK3CA mutations, and these co-occur with expression of estrogen receptor (ER). There are current clinical trial efforts aimed using modern PI3K-inhibitors (PI3Ki) GDC0032, Copanlisib or Gedatolisib to restore responsiveness to ER blockade, but studies to integrate these drugs at a later stage of PIK3CA-mutant BC are lacking. Here we propose a role for these more modern PI3K-inhibitors at later stages of the disease, when PIK3CA-mutant tumors have developed endocrine, cdk4/6i and mTORi resistance. We have recently discovered that PI3Ki work by disrupting an AKT-independent pathway that regulates glycolysis and sustains the Warburg effect, in addition to the disruption of canonical signaling pathways via AKT. In this pathway PI3K triggers the mobilization and release of aldolase from the cytoskeleton, and this in turn potentiates aldolase activity and the Warburg effect. This basic mechanism links PI3K signaling with cytoskeletal dynamics and enhanced glycolytic flux. To what extent PI3Ki efficacy is determined by the ability to inhibit aldolase and to suppress the Warburg effect in advanced cancer, is still unknown and will be examined here. We propose that the activating PIK3CA mutation fuels the carbohydrate metabolism of PIK3CA-mutant BC, even at the stage of endocrine resistance, hat the anti-metabolic activity of PI3K-inhibitors can be visualized using in vivo NMR and exploited to improve treatment outcomes in combination with anti- neoplastic agents. In the first aim we will introduce a mutant form of aldolase to determine the contribution of the PI3K-aldolase axis to PI3Ki-efficacy in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. In the second aim we will determine in vivo if the metabolic changes induced by PI3K-inhibition are predictive of cancer treatment responses. We will visualize lower glycolysis directly in tumors in vivo using NMR detection of 13C[1]-pyruvate metabolism and compare the predictive value of NMR with that of 18FDG-PET CT. Simultaneous studies of the flux of 13C-glucose and 13C[1]-pyruvate will be used to pinpoint mechanisms of resistance. In a third aim, we will develop treatment combinations that may improve the outcomes for women with metastatic BC. Given the vulnerability of BC cells in the early post-mitotic phase, we propose to explore PI3K-inhibition following infusion of taxanes or vinca alkaloids in mouse models of PIK3CA-mutant endocrine-resistant BC. Separately, we will explore if the concept of the PI3Ki/Parpi-combination that is currently in clinical trials in TNBC, can be promising in advanced PIK3CA-mutant BC.  	Address;Adopted;Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;Aldehyde-Lyases;Aldolase A;Antineoplastic Agents;Avidity;Binding;Breast Cancer Cell;Cell Line;Cell division;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Cytoskeleton;Data;Detection;Disease;Drops;Endocrine;Enzymes;Estrogen Receptor Status;Estrogen Receptors;Estrogen receptor positive;G2/M Arrest;Glucose;Glycolysis;Goals;In Vitro;Infusion procedures;Lead;Link;Mammary Neoplasms;Metabolic;Metastatic breast cancer;Mitotic;Modernization;Mutate;Mutation;PIK3CA gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pentosephosphate Pathway;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Positron-Emission Tomography;Predictive Value;Predictive Value of Tests;Protein Isoforms;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Pyruvate;Pyruvate Metabolism Pathway;Receptor Inhibition;Receptor Signaling;Refractory;Resistance;Role;Schedule;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Time;Translating;Treatment outcome;Vinca Alkaloids;Warburg Effect;Woman;Work;arm;cancer cell;cancer therapy;carbohydrate metabolism;chemotherapy;comparative;fluorodeoxyglucose;glucose metabolism;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;mTOR inhibition;malignant breast neoplasm;metabolic imaging;mouse model;mutant;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;nucleotide metabolism;palliative chemotherapy;predictive marker;receptor sensitivity;recruit;resistance mechanism;response;standard of care;taxane;treatment response;treatment strategy;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor metabolism	BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER	BOSTON	MA	UNITED STATES	GERBURG M WULF	DCTD	WEIWEI  Chen	400313	$250k to $499k	400313	1-Mar-2018	1-Mar-2018	28-Feb-2023	PA-16-160	Moonshot

Over 3.3 million men are surviving with PCa in the United States and this number is expected to increase to 4.5 million by 2026. Current therapeutic strategies for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) include androgen receptor (AR) antagonists and a CYP17A1 inhibitor that prevents synthesis of androgens. Although these drugs extend the progression-free survival, approximately 30% of the tumors do not respond to these therapies and the remaining develops resistance shortly after treatment initiation. One of the primary reasons for CRPC relapse, despite these treatments, is expression of constitutively-active AR splice variants (AR-SV) that lack the ligand binding domain (LBD). To overcome this critical barrier, we discovered novel AR antagonists (Selective Androgen Receptor Degraders (SARDs)) that bind to the AR-activation function-1 domain (AF-1) in the N terminal domain (NTD) and/or LBD and antagonize and degrade AR and AR-SVs. The SARDs have unique pharmacologic properties that strongly and selectively antagonize the AR and degrade full length and splice variant AR (independent of LBD) in multiple models. These SARDs inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells and tumors that are dependent on AR full length and splice variants for growth. The SARDs we have tested thus far have poor bioavailability and drug-like properties. In order to overcome the poor bioavailability and to understand the mechanisms of action, we propose a) to develop novel SARDs that will inhibit and degrade full length and splice variants of the AR and will be orally bioavailable and b) to identify mechanisms by which the AR and its splice variants are degraded, resulting in drugs with better efficacy. Under aim-1 we will synthesize AR antagonists belonging to new generation of SARDs that will degrade the AR, inhibit prostate cancer growth, and will be orally bioavailable. We will synthesize and identify orally bioavailable SARDs and evaluate those using in vitro and in vivo PCa and CRPC models. These studies will result in highly potent new SARDs that will have drug-like properties. Under aim-2, we will identify the role of ubiquitination in AR and AR-SV degradation by discerning ubiquitin sites and characterizing their role in AR, AR-SV, and SARD action. Efforts will be dedicated in aim-3 to determine the scavenging role of SARDs and the implications of GATA-2 down-regulation for SARD function. The expected outcome of these studies will be new next generation drugs to treat aggressive CRPC, research tools to study AR degradation, better understanding of the AR and CRPC basic biology, and surrogate endpoints to advance these molecules to clinic.

Those who survive suffer lifelong consequences, largely due to complications from chemotherapy, and disease relapse is inevitable. Thus, there is an urgent need for new, improved treatments to eliminate AML cells rapidly and completely. Since AML is a highly heterogeneous disease caused by multiple mutations, we propose that a common, targetable feature among AML cases is that they are directly and indirectly influenced by cytokines secreted in the bone marrow microenvironment. Our long-term goal is to identify novel drug targets to selectively eradicate malignant clones that may impact the response to AML therapies. Our immediate goals are to comprehensively determine the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory pathways promote clonal evolution in AML. We found that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is elevated in a diverse set of AML patients, both encourages AML cells to multiply and simultaneously impedes normal cell growth. Blocking communication between AML cells and IL-1 inhibits these effects and reduces survival of AML cells while sparing healthy progenitors. Because cells from a majority of AML patients with different genetic subtypes are dependent on IL-1 signaling for their survival, we predict that a large percentage of AML patients might benefit from drugs targeting this pathway. However, direct targeting of IL-1 signaling may impact cellular functions in healthy cells. We therefore focused our study on defining the IL-1-mediated molecular differences between AML and healthy progenitors. Gene expression analysis identified that IL-1 upregulates ASF1B and MARCKS in AML compared to healthy progenitors. ASF1B and MARCKS regulate cell proliferation, DNA damage response, and inflammation in AML. Our data shows that genetic and pharmacological targeting of ASF1B and MARCKS pathways suppresses AML growth. These findings suggest a number of important new research directions. In the proposed project, we will test the hypothesis that differential activation of ASF1B and MARCKS by IL-1β in AML versus healthy progenitors provides a competitive advantage to leukemic cells, which ultimately leads to AML progression. Specifically, we will determine: (1) the in vitro mechanisms by which IL-1 activation of ASF1B and MARCKS promotes the growth of AML cells; (2) the roles of ASF1B and MARCKS in conferring IL-1-mediated growth advantage and driving AML progression in vivo; and (3) the validity of ASF1B and MARCKS as therapeutic targets in AML using available small-molecule inhibitors. To achieve our goals we established a variety of tools including 4 new transgenic mouse models and access to TLK and MARCKS inhibitor through collaborations with world-renowned leaders. Determining the underlying molecular mechanisms by which IL-1 supports AML development will pave the way to designing new treatment strategies.

project	1R01CA231011-01A1	R01CA231011	9733495	2019	Development of Long non-coding RNA-directed Target Therapy for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer	Grant	Project Summary  As a deadly disease lacking an FDA-approved targeted therapy, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) involves a complicated and entangled network of oncogenic processes in which long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a novel class of regulatory RNA molecules, may play important roles. The proposed study will genetically exploit lncRNA-regulated cellular networks in TNBC to identify an improved therapeutic strategy. Our research has illuminated lncRNA involvement in TNBC metastasis and metabolic reprogramming. One lncRNA, LINK-A, is upregulated in TNBC and is negatively correlated with breast cancer patient outcomes. Tissue-specific expression of LINK-A in mouse mammary glands drives tumor development and lung metastasis, which shares morphological and transcriptional similarity to human TNBC. Furthermore, the expression of LINK- A facilities an immunosuppressive environment and profoundly impacts CD9+ T-cell infiltration via lncRNA- mediated antigenicity loss. Mechanistically, LINK-A concurrently activates multiple oncogenic signaling pathways and promotes TRIM71-dependent degradation of the peptide-loading complex, leading to impaired antigen presentation. Therefore, LINK-A transgenic mice should serve as a powerful tool for dissecting the molecular complexity of TNBC and assessing precise therapeutic formulations against TNBC. Since most pathway inhibitors in TNBC clinical trials have been unsuccessful, a lncRNA-directed therapeutic approach, with the appropriate combination of immunotherapy, may optimize the efficacy of therapies for TNBC. The long-term goal of the proposal is to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated antigenicity loss and immunosuppression so that improved strategies can be developed to reduce TNBC morbidity and mortality. Our central hypothesis is that LINK-A promotes the initiation and immunoresistance of breast cancer, which can be attenuated in vivo by a combinatorial treatment approach. We will address our hypothesis from following aspects: we will first define the underlying molecular mechanism of lncRNA-dependent antigenicity loss. We will then restore antigenicity by targeting lncRNA and lncRNA-related signaling events. Finally, we will ascertain the functional importance of lncRNAs in breast cancer tumorigenesis. Emerging evidence of the oncogenic involvement of lncRNAs, as well as their implicated roles in mediating immunosurveillance and immunosuppression, warrants further characterization of TNBC-specific lncRNAs and future applications that hinge on their activity. Our goal is to demonstrate that LINK-A, as a hallmark of TNBC, may serve as a diagnostic marker that predicts a cancer’s sensitivity to immunotherapy. Thus, a strategy that combines immune checkpoint blockers and lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies has the potential to significantly advance TNBC treatment. In the long run, these research findings will benefit the cancer community by introducing the robust clinical effects of targeting lncRNAs and a well-defined means of stratifying patients based on these oncogenic lncRNAs.

project	1R01CA241148-01A1	R01CA241148	9973328	2020	Targeting Aldehyde Dehydrogenase for Cancer Prevention	Grant	ABSTRACT: In cancer, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme activity is high in dendritic cells and regulatory T-cells, hypothesized to modulate the immune response and also in cancer stem cells (CSCs) to aid the development of recurrent resistant disease. It is therefore surprising that drugs targeting ALDH have not been developed to modulate these processes in cancer. To investigate this issue, we tested the efficacy of existing isoform-specific and broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitors on cultured cells and found that none were very effective at modulating cell survival. Furthermore, we predicted that a broad-spectrum inhibitor would be needed due to the overlapping functions of the ALDH family members. These observations provided the rationale to develop a non-toxic broad- spectrum ALDH inhibitor, which would kill ALDH+ CSCs to prevent recurrent resistant disease, and improve immunotherapy of melanoma. Thus, the central hypothesis is that a non-toxic ALDH inhibitor can be developed to reduce recurrent resistant disease development mediated by ALDH+ CSCs and improve the efficacy of existing immunotherapies by reducing immune suppression. Preliminary data show development of a potent non-toxic ALDH inhibitor built on the backbone of the Isatin natural product. This agent eliminates CSCs with high ALDH activity, preventing increases in ALDH+ cells typically seen with traditional drug treatments. Finally, the inhibitor improves the preclinical efficacy of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model where this approach alone is not effective. Based on these hypothesis-supporting preliminary data, the following Specific Aims are proposed. First, determine how effectively a non-toxic broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitor eliminates the melanoma ALDH+ CSC population that expands when treating with traditional chemotherapy. Furthermore, determine its potency when combined with traditional chemotherapy to prevent recurrent resistant disease development. This will be achieved by isolating ALDH+ and ALDH- cell populations from cell lines and patient derived (PDX) tumors and determining inhibitor efficacy for preventing recurrent resistant disease development when provided in combination with current clinically relevant chemotherapy. Finally, the mechanistic basis for inhibition of resistance by the agent combination will be identified. Second, determine the efficacy of a non-toxic broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitor on immune regulatory and effector cells in the tumor microenvironment, alone and when combined with anti-PD1 antibody immunotherapy. Specific targeting of ALDH in melanoma tumor cells and in host cells on therapeutic efficacy will be tested. Mechanisms leading to enhanced immune response will be identified by defining the impact of the inhibitor and antibody combinations on immune cell composition and function within the tumors, assessing the relative ALDH levels in the immune cell populations, and using transient and genetic approaches to target the modulating immune cells. These significant discoveries would demonstrate the efficacy of targeting ALDH enzymes in cancer for modulating resistance and immune cell function, providing needed preclinical validation necessary for clinical translation.

Here we will focus on the RB-tumor suppressor pathway as a central node controlling proliferation downstream of multiple pathways of relevance to therapy of ER+ breast cancer (e.g. endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors). While RB is required for the effective cytostatic response to a range of targeted therapies employed in ER+ breast cancer, multiple pathways can contribute to “cell cycle plasticity” and therefore represent distinct means for generating therapeutic resistance. Here we will delineate the processes underlying this form of resistance, means to elicit durable cell cycle arrest, and approaches to target resistance as observed clinically (Aim 1). Our data and newly published studies indicate that RB loss occurs in ER+ breast cancer as a means to escape from cytostatic therapies. Analysis of the RB locus in ER+ breast cancer indicates loss of one copy of 13q occurs in a significant fraction of ER+ breast cancers, suggesting that such tumors are primed for RB loss. How to subsequently treat tumors that are heterogeneous for RB or are solely RB deficient represents a significant challenge. Using drug screening and organoid approaches we have defined several regimens that are particularly effective against RB-negative tumors and could represent a general means to target ER+ tumors that progress on CDK4/6 inhibitors (Aim 2). Together these aims will interrogate means to further leverage the RB tumor suppressor for a precision approach to the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.	13q;Adjuvant Chemotherapy;Affect;Aromatase Inhibitors;Biological;Breast Cancer Model;Breast Cancer Patient;Breast Cancer Treatment;Bypass;CDK2 gene;CDK4 gene;Cell Cycle;Cell Cycle Arrest;Cell Cycle Deregulation;Cell Cycle Progression;Cell Cycle Regulation;Cell model;Cessation of life;Clinic;Clinical;Complex;Critical Pathways;Cytostatics;Data;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Screening;Drug usage;Estrogen Antagonists;Estrogen Receptor Status;Estrogen Receptors;Estrogen Therapy;Estrogen receptor positive;Estrogens;Event;Evolution;Fulvestrant;Gene Dosage;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Targeting;Genetic;Goals;Hormonal;Intervention;Malignant Neoplasms;Metastatic breast cancer;Modeling;Molecular Target;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organoids;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Publishing;Recurrence;Regimen;Regulatory Pathway;Relapse;Resistance;Risk;Sampling;Seminal;Signal Pathway;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;United States;Woman;Work;base;de novo mutation;genetic evolution;genetic selection;hormone therapy;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant breast neoplasm;next generation;personalized approach;pressure;prognostic;programs;public health relevance;receptor function;response;targeted agent;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;treatment response;tumor;tumor heterogeneity	ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP	BUFFALO	NY	UNITED STATES	Erik  Knudsen,Agnieszka  Witkiewicz	DCTD	SHARAD KUMAR Verma	429531	$250k to $499k	429531	28-Feb-2020	1-Mar-2020	28-Feb-2025	PA-19-056	Moonshot

While EGFR tyrosine kinase activity inhibitors (TKI) have shown effectiveness, within 9-13 months all patients develop resistance including to 3rd generation TKI - Osimertinib. These patients do not have any approved therapy options, therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a novel agent that functions independently of kinase function. DGD1202, a first-in-class, novel, orally bioavailable, small molecule that inhibits EGFR dimerization, induces degradation of EGFR and selectively kills TKI resistant NSCLC tumors. Objective: We and others have shown that the degradation of mutant EGFR protein has a profound effect on cancer cell survival. Thus, we hypothesized that a drug which induces degradation of mtEGFR independent of the ATP binding domain will result in selective activity. Our objective is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of DGD1202 in a panel of lung cancer cells lines, xenografts, and PDXs derived from lung cancer patients containing mtEGFR who have undergone treatment with a TKI. Specific Aims: We propose to evaluate the specificity and potency of DGD1202 against TKI-resistant lung cancer cells and xenografts. Aim 1 is to determine the in vitro efficacy of DGD1202 against a panel of EGFR driven, including osimertinib-resistant, cancer cell lines relative to normal cells. Aim 2 is to conduct in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses to assess drug exposure and determine the effect on the target. Aim 3 is to determine the overall therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety of DGD1202 in vivo. We hypothesize that treatment with DGD1202 will induce EGFR degradation preferentially in tumor cells driven by mtEGFR and that EGFR degradation will correlate with the overall response. Study Design: We will screen DGD1202 alongside osimertinib in a series of lung cancer lines. The resulting response will be then correlated with effect on EGFR degradation. We also propose to determine in vivo PK and PD studies both with a single and with fractionated dosing to determine the optimum bioavailability. Using the optimized dose and schedule, we will assess effects on EGFR protein against a panel mtEGFR-driven and osimertinib resistant lung cancer xenograft and PDX models. The long-term safety will be assessed in immune competent mice. Standard statistical models will be used to compare the response to treatment and how it correlates with effects on EGFR. Impact: We anticipate that our approach will open a new way to target EGFR and, more broadly, to develop therapeutics to selectively target mutated proteins to degradation. The knowledge gained from in vivo tumor models will provide a rationale for the use of this class of molecules in future clinical studies.

The majority of these patients will enter into a prolonged post-treatment survivorship phase of care. However, we are currently facing unprecedented challenges in survivorship care delivery. Serious gaps in the care of survivors have been identified, including underuse of guideline-recommended cancer surveillance services, such as annual mammography for breast cancer survivors and colonoscopy for colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, and underuse of recommended preventive care services such as vaccinations, lipid testing and cardiovascular risk management, and disease screenings. Compounding these issues, our current oncology workforce is insufficient to care for the rapidly growing population of survivors. Primary care provider (PCP)-led survivorship care is a feasible model of survivorship care. In observational studies, survivors who receive care that involves PCPs received higher quality of care; international randomized trials comparing PCP-led to oncology-led survivorship care have shown no significant differences in time to detection of cancer recurrence or quality of life for early-stage survivors. However, there is a paucity of high-quality research on models of survivorship care in the U.S, particularly in community-based settings, seriously limiting our ability to provide high-quality cancer survivorship care. To address these issues, we will conduct a prospective cluster randomized trial of two models of cancer survivorship care in early-stage, low- risk breast cancer and CRC survivors cared for in a community-based, integrated health care setting. Building on our pilot work and drawing on the empirical literature, we will test the efficacy of an embedded PCP model (experimental condition) in which PCPs are embedded within an oncology practice and will care for low-risk survivors who will be transitioned at 12 months post-treatment. These PCPs will be given training in cancer survivorship care focused on cancer surveillance and chronic disease prevention. This model will be compared to the extant oncology physician model (usual care) that is the default condition in this healthcare system. The primary outcome will be receipt of guideline-recommended care (e.g., cancer surveillance, preventive care), assessed over a 36-month period. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated measures of patient-provider communication, care coordination, quality of life, self-efficacy in managing care, and other measures. We will also compare utilization of unplanned care (hospitalizations, urgent care) and receipt of non-recommended care. We will explore PCP perceptions of confidence in delivery of survivorship care. We will conduct this trial in 8 large, hospital-based medical centers of an integrated health care system, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, with approximately 2,000 early-stage breast and CRC survivors. Our results will provide more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of a scalable model of PCP-led survivorship care, addressing the critical shortage of oncology providers while maintaining or improving quality.

However, HCT-related factors, such as total body irradiation used for conditioning, graft-versus-host disease, and prolonged exposure to immunosuppressive therapy, result in very high risk for subsequent skin cancers. Compared with the general population, HCT survivors are also more likely to develop skin cancers at a younger age, have advanced disease at presentation, and experience multiple recurrences. Despite this high burden, less than 20% of long-term HCT survivors report being examined for skin cancer, even though >90% were seen by their primary care physician (PCPs) in the prior year. In HCT survivors, skin cancers develop at a time when their follow-up care has largely transitioned from oncology care to the primary care setting, emphasizing the need to develop innovative strategies that 1) provide HCT survivors with the skills to conduct effective skin self-examinations, and prompt action from their providers when worrisome lesions are found; 2) engage PCPs in HCT risk-based screening for skin cancer; and 3) ensure rapid access to dermatologic exams. Advances in technology, including widespread availability of cell phones and teledermoscopy (remote expert assessment of a photographed lesion) offer promising opportunities to improve early detection and treatment of skin cancer. We propose a comparative effectiveness study that will examine the impact of patient activation and education (PAE), alone or in combination with physician-tailored strategies, on clinically meaningful behavioral outcomes. We will enroll 720 HCT survivors at a large, diverse HCT center to: 1) Determine the impact of PAE alone or with physician activation (PAE+Phys) on skin cancer screening and prevention practices at 12 months; and 2) Among PCPs of HCT survivors, determine the impact of a teledermoscopy e-learning program compared with provision of print materials for identifying suspect lesions. We hypothesize that compared to PAE, patients randomized to PAE+Phys will report higher rates of thorough self- and provider skin exam, shorter time to referral of suspicious lesions, and improved quality of life; compared to print materials alone, physicians randomized to teledermoscopy e-learning will have greater recognition of suspect lesions and more appropriate, cost-effective referral patterns. Our multi-disciplinary team will: 1) establish the efficacy of PAE, and the relative benefit of physician activation; 2) inform the practice of skin cancer screening using innovative mobile strategies that are readily applicable in the clinical setting; and 3) identify facilitators of and barriers to appropriate delivery of survivorship-focused preventive care for long-term HCT survivors. Information obtained from the current study can be used to develop strategies for management of other late effects (e.g. cardiovascular, endocrine) in HCT survivors in the primary care setting, and to improve skin cancer screening in other high-risk (e.g. radiation-exposed) cancer survivor populations.

This proposal is important because by 2040, 73% of survivors will be aged 65+ and almost 50% will be aged 75+. Unfortunately, aging- related conditions (e.g., physical and cognitive function impairments) are not addressed routinely in survivorship care. Preliminary research by all multiple principal investigators (MPIs: Mohile, Janelsins, Mustian) suggests that a Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) intervention is effective for surveilling, triaging and managing physical and cognitive impairments, improving patient and caregiver satisfaction, and fostering communication about aging-related conditions during chemotherapy in older cancer patients and their caregivers. Preliminary research by MPIs also suggests that a Survivorship Health Promotion program is effective for improving physical function among older survivors after chemotherapy. Our MPI team has shown that GEM and Survivorship Health Promotion are feasible to implement in older patients, survivors and caregivers in nationwide samples recruited via the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base network. To fill existing empirical gaps in survivorship care for older survivors and caregivers, we created a novel intervention called Survivorship-GEM by combining these two very promising and synergistic programs. Survivorship-GEM is directed by oncology advanced practice providers (APPs), because they routinely direct care for survivors in the community. We propose to conduct a two-arm cluster randomized trial comparing the efficacy of our novel Survivorship-GEM intervention to usual care for improving physical and cognitive function, satisfaction with care, completion of referral appointments, and hospitalizations among older survivors. We will also examine the effect of Survivorship-GEM on oncology APP communication with primary care providers and on caregiver distress and satisfaction with care. We will randomize 30 NCORP community oncology practices to two arms: 1) Survivorship-GEM or 2) usual care. Survivors aged 65+ (n=720) and caregivers (if available, estimated n=500) will complete baseline assessments at the end of curative-intent chemotherapy for a solid tumor malignancy with follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Our uniquely qualified, multidisciplinary team includes expertise in geriatrics, clinical trials, nursing, primary care, behavioral oncology, rehabilitation, health disparities, biostatistics, and implementation science. The team also benefits from collaborations with the Cancer and Aging Research Group Advisory Board and the SCOREboard patient advocate group. The APP-directed Survivorship-GEM intervention is highly innovative and has tremendous potential to improve outcomes in older survivors and caregivers by surveilling, triaging and managing the effects of chemotherapy and by fostering health promotion.

This research is critical because lung and colorectal cancer survivors have high post-treatment needs, are older, and suffers from greater co-morbidities and poor quality of life (QOL). Lung and colorectal cancer survivors remain underrepresented in research, leading to significant disparities in post-treatment outcomes. Based on the Chronic Care Self-Management Model (CCM), the SSM Intervention includes the following components: 1) care coordination and communication between oncology and primary care on surveillance/follow-up, health promotion, disease prevention, and comorbidity management; 2) provision of clinician care plan to PCPs; 3) comprehensive patient/geriatric assessment for survivors of all ages; 4) personalized care plan for survivors; and 5) survivor self-management skills building for surveillance/follow-up, late and long-term effects of treatments, comorbidities, and healthy living. It is administered in five telehealth sessions (Zoom videoconferencing) and three subsequent maintenance telehealth sessions for survivors who are four months post-treatment. We will test the efficacy of the SSM Intervention using a randomized design of attention control arm versus an intervention arm to pursue the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (Primary): Determine the efficacy of the intervention on care coordination, communication, and provider knowledge at 4 months post-accrual; Specific Aim 2 (Primary): Determine the efficacy of the intervention on survivor outcomes at 4 months post-accrual; and Specific Aim 3 (Exploratory): Assess the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the intervention. The RE-AIM Framework informs intervention delivery process, which will set the stage for future large scale implementation for sustainability in real-world care settings. This proposal is innovative because it addresses a critical need to improve care delivery and outcomes for high needs, understudied survivorship populations (lung, colorectal, older survivors), and the telehealth approach promotes scalability. The interdisciplinary team, which includes expertise in nursing science (Sun, Reb, Ferrell), oncology (Fakih), and primary care (Kim) is uniquely suited to conduct this research. The proposal is significant, with high scientific rigor and outcomes that are of critical importance to survivors, clinicians, healthcare systems, the National Cancer Institute, and the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM. The research will address a critical gap in knowledge of how self-management interventions improve care delivery and outcomes during post-treatment transitions to follow-up care.

project	1R01CA249568-01	R01CA249568	9968717	2020	Onco-primary care networking to support TEAM-based care - the ONE TEAM Study	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Since the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released the seminal report, From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition 13 years ago, there has been substantial progress in understanding the health issues affecting cancer survivors, yet little has changed regarding survivorship care delivery. There remains a disconnect between primary care providers and oncology care teams that has led to persistent problems implementing risk-stratified survivorship care for cancer survivors. With advances in cancer therapy and improved survival rates, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) now exceeds that of the cancer for many survivors. While cancer therapy may contribute to this risk, it is generally a compilation of non-modifiable factors (i.e., genetics, aging), as well as modifiable lifestyle behaviors (i.e., diet, exercise) that lead to both the cancer and to cardiovascular disease (CVD). With the lack of primary care provider (PCP) integration in the cancer care team and time constraints and difficulty keeping up with rapidly evolving non-cancer therapeutics for medical oncologists, there is an inferred lower priority for comorbidity management. We will determine the effectiveness of the multi-level iGuide intervention and the up-titrated iGuide2 intervention compared with usual care on the primary outcomes. The theory-driven, self-guided iGuide intervention consists of patient-level components (video vignettes, patient-facing webinars) and PCP-level components (electronic health record [EHR] automated cancer specialist-PCP letter, tele-education series, and automated reminders). The up-titrated iGuide2 intervention consists of tailored patient-level video vignettes and targeted EHR specialist-PCP communication. The primary outcomes of the ONE TEAM SMART-design study are (1) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures of management of the three CVD comorbidities (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia) based upon laboratory and clinical measurement; (2) medication adherence assessed pharmacy refill data using Proportion of Days Covered (PDC); and (3) patient-provider communication (Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care). Secondary aims include exploring moderating and mediating factors in each level of the intervention, support of patient-centered outcomes, health care use, measures of provider activation, and costs of care resulting from the multi-level intervention. The overarching goal of this proposed project is to optimize the management and outcomes of individuals with cancer, both during and after treatment, and to develop a ‘low-touch’ multi-level intervention that can be generalized, adapted and scaled in other health care systems.

In some cases, the primary tumor is too small to be detected, with enlarged nodes being the only manifestation of HNSCC. These unknown primary cancers (UPCs), often induced by human papilloma virus (HPV), usually arise in the mucosa of Waldeyer's ring, the lymphatic tonsillar tissues of the pharynx. Finding UPC is significant and impactful addressing an unmet need with long term oncologic and functional outcomes improved by locating and removing UPC. However, their detection is impaired by the corrugated, cryptic surface, and nodularity of lymphatic tissue which decreases the sensitivity of physical examination while the vascularity and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity of the lymphoid tissue obscure small tumors by computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET).  We have invented a library of ultra pH sensitive (UPS) nanoprobes, covalently conjugated to indocyanine green (ICG) that respond to acidic tumor microenvironment, with a concomitant sharp change in their fluorescence state from OFF to ON. One such nanoprobe, ONM-100, has been developed and studied in a Phase 1 and ongoing FDA approved Phase 2 clinical trial. it has been shown to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events, compatible with surgical endoscopes, and able to detect a variety of cancers including HNSCC in real time. Based on these data we hypothesize that ONM-100 used as an adjunct to SOC panendoscopy can improve detection of UPC. To test our hypothesis, we will (1) Compare the sensitivity and specificity of activatable probe ONM-100 for cancer detection to always ON probes for tumors in Waldeyer's ring; (2) Detect HPV-mediated HNSCC in patients after systemic administration of ONM-100 comparing fluorescence to true-positive cancers; (3) Detect UPC in patients after systemic administration of ONM-100. Successful execution of this project will provide precise excision of UPC and avoidance of intense adjuvant therapy for UPC patients significantly improving care and outcomes for these patients who suffer greatly from less oncologically effective imprecise overtreatment.

Lung cancer is the leading cancer-related cause of death and the third most diagnosed cancer in the United States. Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), represent 90% of lung cancers, and surgical resection continues to be the most effective approach to cure patients with low stage premetastatic disease. Surgeons typically use visual inspection and finger palpation to define solid tumor margins. However, this approach is often insufficient to detect residual disease, leading to recurrence in up to 40% of patients and significantly reduced 5-year survival. Improving intraoperative detection of tumor margins is imperative, because small foci of residual disease at or close to the resection margins are the most common cause of local recurrence. The most important prognostic indicator following cancer surgery is complete resection, which prolongs patient survival and improves post- surgical quality of life. Contrast enhancement of tumors using near-infrared (NIR) imaging with targeted fluorophores can identify small lesions that are not detectable by visual observation or palpation. NIR imaging offers high resolution and sensitivity and can be performed in real-time during surgery. In this application, we propose to translate DDAO-arachidonate (DDAO-A), an activatable probe designed to specifically target cPLA2α, a critical signaling enzyme upregulated early in tumorigenesis and overexpressed in more than 47% of NSCLC. Preliminary Studies indicate that DDAO-A is selectively activated by murine and human NSCLC tumors, and can detect small foci in both mouse models and excised human lung tumor tissue. DDAO-A will be synthesized under GLP conditions and dispersed in clinically approved liposomal formulations for delivery. Selected mouse studies will be performed to confirm probe activation, tumor targeting and the ability to detect tumor margins. Systemic toxicity will be evaluated in mice and in a small cohort of canines. We will utilize an established platform for clinical translation of NIR fluorophores, employing a canine clinical trial for intraoperative surgery. We will recruit a patient cohort of 30 companion animals with spontaneous NSCLC presenting to our Veterinary School. DDAO-A will be used for detection of primary tumors and identification of tumor margins during intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) in canine patients. We will investigate both systemic injection and topical application for detection of residual tumor. These data will be compared to control surgical cohorts using the non-targeted indocyanine green (ICG) or without NIR fluorescence guidance. If successful, this study will improve surgical outcomes by improving localization of small tumor deposits in the lung, lymph nodes and margins. The completion of these studies will form the basis for an investigational new drug (IND) application in support of a clinical trial to assess DDAO-A-guided surgery in human lung cancer patients.

project	1R21CA215968-01	R21CA215968	9305413	2017	Investigating developmental Hox programs as determinants of sarcomagenesis	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Hijacking of normal developmental programs is a common mechanism of tumorigenesis and deregulation of developmental HOX programs, in particular, contributes to the pathogenesis of leukemia, as well as some solid tumors. We recently discovered that HOX gene expression is highly deregulated in Ewing sarcoma, an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor that has a peak incidence in adolescence. Specifically, the posterior HOX genes, HOXD10, HOXD11 and HOXD13, are over-expressed compared to other normal and malignant tissues, and down-regulation of HOXD13 in Ewing sarcoma cell lines results in a dramatic decrease in tumorigenicity. The expression of all Hox genes normally becomes restricted to distinct regions of the developing musculoskeletal (MSK) system during embryonic development, with the posterior genes becoming restricted to the lumbosacral vertebrae, pelvis and developing forelimb and hindlimb – the dominant sites of Ewing sarcoma presentation clinically. Recent work from the Wellik laboratory has shown that Hox-expressing cells arise as mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells (MSCs) during embryonic development and persist as regionally-restricted MSCs through postnatal and adult stages. MSCs have been implicated as putative cells of origin for Ewing sarcoma, but the precise identity of the target cells, the molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation and a clear explanation of the region-specific etiology of this tumor type remain poorly understood. Important for this application, the Lawlor lab has shown that ectopic expression of the Ewing sarcoma driver oncogene, EWS/FLI1, in bulk populations of MSCs initiates tumorigenesis and disrupts HOX gene expression as a result of epigenetic deregulation. These two key findings lead us to the novel hypothesis that EWS/FLI1-dependent disruption of the posterior HOX program in MSCs where these genes are developmentally and regionally expressed (i.e. the posterior skeleton) is central to Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis. We will determine the efficiency and latency of EWS/FLI1-induced tumor formation in Hox-expressing MSCs that are isolated from different anatomic sites and test the hypothesis that oncogenic transformation occurs more readily in MSC populations where restricted, posterior Hox gene expression has been established. We will use Hoxa11eGFP reporter mice to monitor ectopic induction of the posterior Hox program in transduced cells and their resultant tumors. Use of MSCs from control and Hox mutant mouse lines will allow us to determine if posterior Hox genes are functionally required for the transformation process in vivo as our in vitro data suggest. With the biochemical, molecular and in vivo genetic tools the two labs have developed, successful demonstration of this novel hypothesis during this funding period will provide the basis for future highly impactful and mechanistic dissection of the etiology of Ewing's sarcoma, including a molecular basis for understanding the regional specificity of this tumor in vivo.

Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Molecular profiling – the practice of molecularly testing tumors in order to find specific gene or protein alterations which can be used to recommend targeted therapies – is increasingly used in oncology and is fast becoming a major part of precision medicine. In practice, each patient or physician generally receives a list of molecular anomalies and a list of therapies which are predicted to be beneficial or not beneficial based on the tumor molecular profile. This may lead to a difficult process of prioritizing therapies for individual patients. In the current proposal, we will develop computational network-based approaches to therapy recommendation by using existing resources to inform the connections between drugs and gene or protein variants. We will consider approaches both for creating “average” networks based on population-level data and for creating “patient-specific” networks based on an individual’s specific tumor profile. We will also design and implement an interactive data visualization approach for these networks which will be usable by both clinical researchers and clinicians. The methods and tools developed as part of this project will be entirely reproducible and shared with the community via open-source software packages and interactive tools. We believe our project could eventually lead the way to improving the way therapies are targeted to cancer patients.

project	1R33CA202881-01A1	R33CA202881	9233713	2017	Cancer histology and QC via MUSE: Sample-sparing UV surface-excitation microscopy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY: Pathology—determining the causes and effects of disease, often by using a microscope to examine patients' tissue—is essential for arriving at a correct cancer diagnosis, but it has become increasingly important to submit relevant portions of often tiny tissue samples for DNA and other molecular and functional tests. Making sure that the submitted material actually contains tumor, in sufficient quantity, is not always easy, and sometimes just preparing conventional microscope slides can consume most or even the entire specimen. We have developed a new, simple and inexpensive approach we term MUSE, for Microscopy with UV Surface Excitation, that can provide high-resolution images directly and quickly from fresh tissue without consuming it, and thus can preserve intact, high-quality specimens for biobanking, downstream molecular and functional analyses.  MUSE, by ensuring that acquired small biopsy specimens are indeed fit for purpose, can avoid the need to have a patient return at a later date for additional biopsies. In addition, the method will allow for lesion detection over larger cross-sections of tissue, such as organ whole-mounts, not currently practical with conventional instrumentation. Finally, we expect that MUSE will yield additional biologically informative imaging by avoiding artifacts inherent in conventional tissue processing and sectioning. We focus here on facilitation of tissue-based molecular studies, viable tumor harvest for xenografts and cultured spheroids, and biobanking, and include crucial validation studies to ensure that the MUSE process does not compromise sample utility due to possible impacts from exposure to intercalating dyes and/or UV light.  MUSE relies on two mechanisms: 1) surface-restricted excitation of fluorescent dyes due to micron- scale penetration of sub-300-nm ultraviolet light; and 2) the fact that many conventional dyes excited in this way emit visible light. These signals are bright enough to be detected by conventional color cameras using sub-second exposure times, allowing rapid imaging of large areas.  MUSE eliminates any requirement for conventional histology processing with formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, or thin-sectioning. It requires no lasers, confocal, multiphoton or optical coherence tomography instrumentation, can eventually cost in the range of a few thousands of dollars, and therefore affordable at the point of care (point of biopsy). MUSE samples are stained within seconds using familiar histology stains, such as eosin and DAPI, and the resulting high-resolution images converted from fluorescence to H&E-like brightfield appearance for interpretation in real time (but with novel and potentially useful features) easily interpreted by pathologists.  While rapid cellular-scale imaging of fresh tissue can have significant benefits in clinical arenas, it can also empower basic and translational research use for essentially instant histology-, pathology- or toxicology-relevant images directly from experimental animal models—at the bench—and may help relieve such investigators from having to rely on often overworked, sometimes unavailable, conventional histology and pathology services.

project	1R33CA212806-01A1	R33CA212806	9358064	2017	Ex vivo culture platform validation for preservation of patient derived multiple myeloma cells	Grant	Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B cell malignancy characterized by a clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM), the presence of high levels of monoclonal serum antibody, and the development of bone lesions. Despite the introduction of a number of novel treatments MM patients still are confronted with an average survival time of 5-7 years. Emerging evidence suggests that the endosteal niche at the bone-BM interface fosters the survival of drug-resistant MM cells, especially through adhesive interactions with osteoblasts, and is therefore responsible for relapse. Currently, treatment options for MM patients are evaluated mainly on the basis of clinical features and historical population response rates. Therefore, an important unmet clinical need is to develop the ability to select the best therapy for an individual based on the ex vivo response of the patient's MM cells (PMMCs) to drug treatment options. This precision medicine approach is expected to provide a transformative means of: (1) reducing ineffective therapies, (2) minimizing excess toxicity and cost, (3) inhibiting the development of the tumor cells' cross-resistance to additional drugs as a critical part of the long-term care of MM patients, and (4) assessing the probability of relapse occurrence. A major challenge, however, is the lack of clinically relevant, high-throughput and inexpensive models that preserve primary patient biospecimen for downstream analyses and use. The goal of this R33 project is to improve and validate a multiple myeloma (MM) culture platform, which was developed through the prior R21 award to enable the ex vivo preservation of PMMCs derived from BM biospecimens. The specific aims of the project are to: (1) increase the culture platform's high- throughput operation capability by implementing a gravity-driven, pumpless flow control strategy while preserving the feasibility of producing the device using industry standard materials and manufacturing practice and (2) prospectively correlate the ex vivo chemosensitivity and resistance of PMMCs with clinical response as a means of validating the predictive capability of our ex vivo MM culture platform and expand drug-resistant PMMCs for downstream characterization as a potential means of guiding subsequent treatment selection. Anticipated results will validate that ex vivo preserved MM biospecimens can be widely used with our culture platform for screening patient-specific treatment options as well as for other applications such as preclinical evaluation of new therapeutics, studying drug-resistant PMMC populations, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and ex vivo models of breast and prostate cancers that metastasize to BM and bone.

Unfortunately, there are substantial gaps in existing capabilities in terms of sensitivity. For example, a minimum of many thousands of cells is required for in-depth profiling of proteins in a biological sample. We have recently developed a breakthrough technology, termed nanoPOTS (Nanodroplet Preparation in One pot for Trace Samples) which, when coupled to ultrasensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), enables effective analysis of as few as 10 mammalian cells with a coverage of >3000 identified proteins. We hypothesize that the nanoPOTS platform will be an enabling technology to characterize the molecular underpinnings of tumor heterogeneity by creating 3D proteome maps of human tumors. The overall objective of our study is to extend and validate this analysis platform to enable single-cell resolution measurements at high throughput (>100 samples per day) and apply the platform to create 3D proteome maps of human tumors. Studies in Aim 1 will focus on optimizing and validating the ultrasensitive nanoPOTS proteomic workflow to enable robust proteome profiling of ≥3,000 protein groups from single human cells obtained by both flow cytometry and laser capture microdissection (LCM). Aim 2 will evaluate and compare two complementary technologies for increasing measurement throughput to ~100 cells/day with minimal impact on proteome coverage. We will determine whether multiplexing through application of isobaric labels for pooled analysis, or rapid LC coupled with ultrahigh resolution ion mobility spectrometry-MS provides greatest coverage, quantitation and reproducibility for single cell proteomics at the desired throughput. In Aim 3, we will apply the optimized platform to create in-depth proteome maps for human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) at single cell resolution. Following initial targeted studies of specific cells of interest within sectioned tissues, we will use a combination of cryosectioning, LCM and the optimized nanoPOTS platform to analyze single cells within the tumor microenvironment. 3D reconstruction of these in-depth, spatially resolved proteomic analyses will provide the first global proteomic tumor maps at single-cell resolution. This project will not only establish an innovative measurement capability that will broadly advance cancer research, but will also provide unique molecular insights into cellular heterogeneity relevant to PDA pathology. The resulting platform will be disseminated through a combination of publication and commercialization.

project	1R33CA225281-01	R33CA225281	9482918	2017	Area C: Functional microscale organotypic assays to predict patient response to anti-angiogenesis therapies	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cancer is driven both by genetic mutations and microenvironmental factors (e.g. cell-cell interactions). It is now clear that in order to develop effective therapies and predict patient response we need to better understand these interactions. Biomimetic tissue-engineered technologies and models hold the promise of incorporating more components into in vitro/ex vivo models and, thus, make them more accurately reflect human disease. Here we focus on kidney cancer and specifically, on the interactions between cancer cells and the vasculature (i.e. endothelial cells) - an interaction that is understudied, yet critical to better understanding, applying anti-angiogenic drugs and developing new such therapies. Our proposal describes an integrated approach that increases relevance by enabling physiologically relevant models that replicate structure/function relationships while providing patient specificity. Our approach is transdisciplinary including expertise in oncology (Christos Kyriakopoulos), surgery (Jason Abel), pathology (Wei Huang), clinical imaging (Steve Cho), biostatistics/clinical analysis (Kyungmann Kim) and microtechnology/organotypic models (David Beebe). Specifically, we will develop a robust microvessel culture approach (uVESSEL) to create an in vitro/ex vivo model of kidney cancer-vascular interactions using the patient's own cells to measure therapy response of patient specific uVESSEL model (Aim 1), measure patient response via multiple endpoints (incl. PSMA-based PET/CT imaging) (Aim 2), and evaluate predictive value of patient specific uVESSEL model (Aim 3).

Recent clinical and experimental studies addressing this problem require the arduous collection of pre- and post- treatment data for every new specific treatment and cancer type studied. Thus, a computational approach that can expedite the identification of molecular determinants of resistance via the analysis of existing large-scale cancer cohorts is called for.  Our proposal seeks to identify novel ways to counter de novo and acquired resistance through drug combinations. We focus on gene interactions rather than individual genes and leverage large scale genomic datasets and patient response data. Our approach is based on recent work in the Ruppin and other labs showing that genetic interactions can be computationally identified by analyzing omics tumor data.  To decipher pathways of resistance to cancer therapies, we focus here on studying a new type of genetic interactions, termed synthetic rescues (SRs). SRs denote a functional interaction between two genes whereby a fitness reducing change in the activity of one of the two genes (termed the vulnerable gene) is compensated by altered activity of another gene (termed the rescuer gene), which restores cell fitness and rescues it. We have recently developed tools for SR data-driven identification from large cancer tumors cohorts, successfully enabling the prediction of drug response and emergence of resistance in patients. Building on these transformational results the specific aims of this proposal are: Specific Aim 1. Perform a pan-cancer and cancer type-specific SR-based analyses, focusing on melanoma, breast, head and neck, and colon cancer, identifying the major rescuer genes in each cancer type, together with specific recommendations of combinatorial therapies mitigating resistance. Specific Aim 2. Develop a new version of SR analysis tools that will be made publically available for use by others in a standard, user friendly manner and includes analysis of gene methylation and genome wide mutation data, on top of other omics data already utilized in our previous SR inference tools. Specific Aim 3. Experimentally test predicted rescuer targets and combination therapies in patient derived resistant cancer cells.  Taken together the proposed study, will present a transformative SR based approach for identifying and targeting resistance pathways across the whole cancer genome.

project	1R33CA225296-01	R33CA225296	9482979	2017	Advanced Cancer Classification via Single-Cell Electrophoretic Cytopathology	Grant	ABSTRACT Recent efforts to identify and circumvent mechanisms of drug resistance point to the role of HER2 truncated isoforms, which lack the extracellular domain of the full-length protein targeted by trastuzumab. Understanding the biology of HER2 isoforms is crucial to developing new drugs personalized for individuals resistant to trastuzumab therapy. However, detection of these isoforms in paraffin-embedded tissue sections (FFPE) is impossible by conventional methods (Immunohistochemistry, IHC) due to the lack of isoform-specific antibodies and the loss of epitope integrity during tissue processing. To overcome these barriers, the goal of this project is to develop a robust tool that will both allow retrospective studies on HER2 isoforms and enable isoform screening on a patient-to-patient basis to tailor breast cancer treatment. Our efforts fill a major gap in cancer research: the limited ability to scrutinize tissue sections for protein targets that either lack highly specific antibody probes (analytical) or lose epitope integrity during tissue processing (pre- analytical). We introduce a whole-tissue western blot (wtWestern) that creates a novel 3D protein ‘imprint’ of the tissue section for stable storage and downstream antibody probing. The unique dual-functionality wtWestern electrophoretically resolves proteins (extracted from a 2D tissue section) along the depth (z-axis) of a supporting photoactive hydrogel layer. Exposure to UV light covalently links protein to the hydrogel. We benchmark the fixative-free imprint for biobanking suitability, apply the wtWestern to measurement of proteins (including isoforms) in archived frozen or FFPE tissue sections, and maximize tissue utility by enabling detection of 20+ proteins for cancer sub-type classification. This innovative wtWestern is expected to maximize the quality and utility of biospecimens for downstream analyses – critically important to retrospective studies that form the basis for both cancer diagnostics/prognostics and personalized medicine.

Tissue diagnostics for precision oncology increasingly rely on multi-valent assays to characterize cancer biology and identify therapeutic targets. The power of molecular imaging for cancer diagnosis has been well demonstrated by [18F]fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT), widely used in clinical oncology. PET tracers targeted to facets of tumor biology now enable multi-valent molecular imaging to identify therapeutic targets. Early studies show that combined tracer studies, commonly FDG plus a target- specific tracer, are highly predictive of tumor response to targeted therapy. However, emissions from different PET tracers are indistinguishable to a PET scanner, requiring separate imaging sessions on separate days for multiple 18F-based tracers (~ 2 hour half-life) in the same patient. This limits the clinical practicality of multi-tracer PET, and fails to exploit the full power of multi-tracer PET to quantify tumor in vivo biology and biologic heterogeneity for highly variable process such as cancer metabolism. We will overcome this limitation by taking advantage of recent developments in volumetric PET scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis methods from our laboratories to develop Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate multi-valent, quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session to guide precision oncology and translational cancer biology research. As such, our proposed technology development project addresses a need, described under Priority Area B for “new capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer patients”. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we now propose to integrate and enhance these methodologies to develop and validate Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate quantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session. We will develop and test this approach for simultaneous glucose and glutamine metabolism imaging, with the goal of guiding metabolism-targeted therapy such as inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The project will focus on the technology developments (largely computational) that enable multi-tracer imaging. Ongoing and separately funded work on clinical studies will acquire data from two separate imaging PET sessions using current technology and will provide data for method development. We will first optimize tracer dose timing, image reconstruction, and image time binning for dual tracer MTV-PET (Aim 1), followed by implementation and technical validation of image analysis using a mixture analysis approach (Aim 2). This will set the stage for technical validation of MTV-PET (Aim 3) and an exploratory aim (Aim 4) testing image analytics based on machine learning. Successful completion of our technology development will yield a new method for multi-tracer PET that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarker and precision oncology research, consistent with goals of RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B.	4D Imaging;Address;Agreement;Algorithms;Area;Biological Assay;Biology;Breast Cancer Patient;Cancer Biology;Cancer Diagnostics;Cancer Patient;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Cluster Analysis;Consumption;Data;Data Set;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Dose;Emerging Technologies;Funding;Glucose;Glutaminase;Glutamine;Glycolysis;Goals;Half-Life;Heterogeneity;Hour;Human;Image;Image Analysis;Injection of therapeutic agent;Kinetics;Laboratories;Lactate Dehydrogenase;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic;Metabolism;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Outcome;Patients;Phenotype;Positron-Emission Tomography;Process;Radiation exposure;Reference Standards;Research;Technology;Testing;Three-Dimensional Image;Time;Tissues;Tracer;Tumor Biology;Validation;Work;analytical method;anticancer research;base;cancer diagnosis;cancer imaging;clinical Diagnosis;cohort;diagnostic biomarker;genomic biomarker;glucose metabolism;high dimensionality;image reconstruction;imaging biomarker;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant breast neoplasm;metabolic rate;method development;molecular imaging;novel;parametric imaging;personalized diagnostics;phenotypic biomarker;precision oncology;radiotracer;reconstruction;response;targeted treatment;technology development;therapeutic target;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor metabolism;whole body imaging	UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	JOEL S KARP,DAVID A.

Colonoscopy as primary screening has been accompanied by a modest but steady decline in CRC incidence through identification and removal of precursor lesions, the adenomatous polyp. Indeed, there has been a 32% decline between years 2000-2013 in CRC incidence in patients over age 50 (thus eligible for screening). Strikingly, during this same time period, the incidence rate for those under 50 has increased by 22%. Thus, new and effective screening strategies are urgently needed to address the rising burden of CRC (≤50 years) which is expected to increase over the next decade with the rising young population. The objective of the R33 Moonshot Project is to develop a highly advanced screening approach to identify the subset of young patients who actually harbor advanced adenomas and could benefit from colonoscopy via a test that is sensitive to advanced adenomas, low-cost, and that can be carried out in a primary care setting. To this end, we have developed a new technology, partial wave spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy or nanocytology. Nanocytology performed on colonocytes swabbed from the rectal mucosa is able to identify nanoscale alterations in higher order chromatin structure, which are highly accurate markers of the presence of advanced adenomas that might be located anywhere in the colon. The goal for the proposed project is to finalize the PWS technology, turn it into a practical, accurate, and low-cost test that is viable for young population screening, and conduct a pre-definitive clinical trial. We aim to achieve sensitivity and specificity over 90%. Upon the completion of this moonshot project, nanocytology will be ready for a definitive clinical trial, which can lead to CLIA approval and launch in clinical practice as a laboratory-developed test (LDT).

Recently, significant progress has been made in both understanding the genetic foundation of these tumors as well as how to harness the power of the immune system to target these most devastating tumors. While there has been substantial evidence in support of using T cells to treat established tumors in mice and humans, the translational value of these treatments has been limited by the simplicity of glioma models used for their development: mostly relying on transplanted tumors that do not recapitulate the immune microenvironment present in human gliomas. To this end, this proposal seeks to develop a spontaneous and genetically faithful mouse glioma model by combining the initial IDH1R132H driver mutation with other most common mutations. These models will maintain the integrity of the immune microenvironment of the brain and best recapitulating human glioma. With these models, we will also assess the interplay between glioma development and the immune response as dictated by different genetic mutations.  Our second aim is to identify IDH1R132H reactive T cell antigen receptors (TCRs). We aim to improve the current technology which employs single cell RNAseq to clone both the TCRα and TCRβ chains. We will optimize the current cloning procedures to dramatically reduce the reagent expense and labor cost, which is essential for its clinical application. This aim will be extended into a translational direction, aim 3, through genetic engineering of T cells to redirect their antigen specificity against IDH1R132H. This aim is essentially a proof-of-principle study for TCR-T adoptive transfer immunotherapy in our immune-competent mouse glioma models.  Combined, novel animal models and technologies developed in this study will help elucidate the complexities underlying glioma genetics and how these commonly mutated genes contribute to glioma development, progression, and glioma-specific immune suppression mechanisms. In addition, this will also facilitate the development and implementation a novel strategy for glioma immunotherapy.

project	1R33CA225400-01	R33CA225400	9483217	2017	Area B: Precise DCE-MRI Assessment of Brain Tumors	Grant	AREA B: PRECISE DCE-MRI OF BRAIN TUMORS PROJECT SUMMARY This project will develop and validate an improved dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI technique for assessing brain tumor response to therapy. Rationale: Historically, increases in tumor size or enhancement have signified tumor progression, and decreases in tumor size have signified treatment response. With the advent of novel chemotherapy agents, including immunotherapy, simple changes in size or enhancement are no longer sufficient to make treatment decisions. We believe that improved DCE-MRI methods can provide new and powerful biomarkers to image brain tumors and detect early response to therapy. This will enhance our ability to prolong survival in a higher proportion of brain tumor patients traditionally regarded as the most dire prognostic group (including recurrent high-grade glioma and metastatic melanoma), who are often left out of clinical trials due to very short life expectancy. Innovation: We propose Specially Tailored Acquisition and Reconstruction (STAR) DCE-MRI, in which acquisition and reconstruction are tailored from an estimation- theoretic point of view to create the most accurate and reproducible tracer kinetic (TK) parameter maps, unlike conventional approaches that optimize the quality of intermediate images. We will fully integrate TK models with DCE-MRI acquisition and reconstruction. Our preliminary data shows 36-fold improvement in spatial resolution and coverage compared to current techniques, with no loss of image quality in brain tumor patients; and we expect to only get better. Compared to current state-of-the-art DCE-MRI, this technique will provide three major advances: 1- exquisite (sub-1 mm isotropic) spatial resolution to quantitatively assess narrow tumor margins and small lesions, 2- whole-brain coverage including all lesions and all surrounding tissue thereby simplifying the exam, 3- robust measurement of patient specific arterial inputs which are required for accurate contrast agent kinetic modeling. Approach: We will optimize, technically validate, and clinically evaluate STAR DCE-MRI method that provides improved quantitative parametric brain maps including blood- brain barrier leakage and fractional plasma volume. Specifically, we will: 1- optimize and technically validate STAR DCE-MRI to produce accurate and reproducible TK parameter maps, 2- produce a robust clinical implementation of STAR DCE-MRI, and 3- clinically evaluate STAR DCE-MRI in patients with brain tumors, specifically those with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with an anti-angiogenic agent, and those with brain melanoma metastases treated with an immunotherapy agent. Broader Impact: Improved quantitative multi- parametric DCE-MRI has a potential role in the assessment of all neurologic diseases that have a microvascular component. This technical work, particularly leveraging specific nonlinear temporal models during image reconstruction, is likely to have implications for DCE-MRI of prostate, renal, breast, and liver tumors as well as outside of DCE-MRI. Importantly it addresses a critical unmet need in oncology in providing a robust, reproducible, high spatio-temporal resolution and high spatial coverage biomarker as a potential end point for clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents in cancer research.

project	1R33CA263666-01	R33CA263666	10293808	2021	Integrative Visualization of Spatiotemporal Tumor Atlases	Grant	Project Summary With the rise of new high-throughput technologies that enable the measurement of biomolecules at the single-cell level within the spatial tissue context, emerging human tumor atlases promise to illuminate the role of cellular interactions in cancer. Spatiotemporal tumor atlases integrate molecular, cellular, and structural information, as well as clinical data. Interpretation of the resulting 2D and 3D maps will lead to new insights into molecular processes that drive tumorigenesis and eventually guide the development of new cancer treatment strategies. The development of specialized visual exploration tools to support this discovery process is critical. However, these tools must be designed to address several challenges: a large number of features such as cells or molecules that need to be visualized, the need to link across diverse modalities such as genomic and imaging data, the presence of multiple timepoints and organizational scales, as well as the volume of data generated by many assays. Furthermore, the cancer research community includes a broad spectrum of user audiences with varying data visualization needs. Therefore, we propose to create a framework for integrative, web-based visualization of human tumor atlases. Our work will be guided by user-centered design processes and we will be collaborating with users in the cancer research community to elicit user needs and to evaluate our visualization tools. This will allow us to design and implement visualization tools that are appropriate for the targeted user audiences. Given the diversity and size of the datasets generated by assays used to build tumor atlases, we will design this framework to be extensible and scalable from the ground up. We are proposing three distinct aims for this project. One aim is to develop a modular, web-based toolkit for visual analysis of multimodal spatial single-cell cancer datasets. This toolkit will also be available through R and Python APIs for integration into computational notebooks. This will enable data analysts and software developers to connect any visualizations created with the toolkit to state of the art computational analysis techniques, which complement the visual exploration supported by the visualizations. Another aim of our work is the design and implementation of novel methods for comparative and longitudinal visualization of spatiotemporal tumor atlas data sets. Finally, we will also build a web-based platform that will allow any cancer researcher to create their own interactive visualizations of multimodal spatiotemporal tumor atlas datasets through a graphical user interface. Users will also be able to share links to these visualizations with other researchers and the general public.	3-Dimensional;Address;Atlases;Biological Assay;Cells;Cellular Structures;Clinical;Clinical Data;Communication;Communities;Complement;Computer Analysis;Computer software;Computing Methodologies;Custom;Data;Data Set;Development;Ensure;Environment;Evaluation;General Population;Genomics;Human;Image;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Measurement;Methods;Modality;Molecular;Online Systems;Process;Proteomics;Pythons;Research Personnel;Resolution;Role;Techniques;Tissues;Tumor Biology;Visual;Visualization;Visualization software;Work;anticancer research;base;cancer cell;cancer therapy;comparative;data visualization;design;flexibility;graphical user interface;high throughput technology;insight;iterative design;member;metabolomics;multimodal data;multimodality;novel;spatiotemporal;tool;transcriptomics;treatment strategy;tumor;tumorigenesis;user centered design	HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL	BOSTON	MA	UNITED STATES	Nils  Gehlenborg	DCB	DAVID J MILLER	1532606	>=$1M	1532606	20-Sep-2021	24-Sep-2021	31-Aug-2025	RFA-CA-20-044	Moonshot

Our project aims to make single cell genomics data, such as that from the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, more explorable and interpretable by the broader cancer research community. We propose to enhance UCSC Xena, a widely-used cancer genomics data visualization resource, with new, full-featured single cell data visualizations for investigator-specified, Moonshot-aligned use cases. We will employ User Centered Design (UCD), a research-backed process and methodology that involves iterative interactions with users and collaborators, throughout the development of these visualizations. We will work closely with two Cancer Moonshot projects, following UCD methodologies, to ensure our visualizations and interfaces serve research needs and are easy to use. In Aim 1 we will collaborate with two cancer research groups to develop novel visualizations for single cell Cancer Moonshot data. We will collaborate with UCSF-led NCI’s Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Network to enhance the Xena Browser to elucidate changes in tumors and surrounding microenvironment in response to therapy, including a visualization to leverage clinical outcomes from bulk tumor data. We will collaborate with OHSU Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) center to develop multi-modal visualizations for the HTAN data, including a novel cross-mapping visualization for spatially resolved and non-spatial data multi-modal data. Aim 2 will develop the software infrastructure needed to support these accessible, high-performance single-cell data visualizations. This will include performance enhancements for the Xena Browser, hardening our integration with Jupyter Notebook/RStudio and adding connectors to single cell data analysis tools, and, finally, incorporating a UCSC-developed Cell State and Microenvironment signature library into our visualizations. Aim 3 will develop user training and support to promote adoption of new visualizations and connected analyses, disseminating these new visualizations and analyses to the widest possible community.

However, only a minority of patients derives clinical benefit, while some develop off-target effects. To identify novel biomarkers of disease course and response, as well as potential off-target responses to immunotherapy in cancer patients, the NCI’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative (CMI) is supporting a growing number of cancer immunotherapy trials. Our team is at the forefront of the CMI efforts with two grants: 1) a U24 on high-dimensional immune monitoring of NCI-supported immunotherapy trials as part of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP); and 2) a U01 on characterizing and predicting a toxic side-effect of immunotherapy, colitis, in immune checkpoint blockade- treated cancer patients, as part of the Immuno-Oncology Translational Network (IOTN). However, with the rapid development of new and improved technologies, these studies produce diverse data types of ever- expanding size and complexity. Visualizing, exploring, and communicating results from the computational analysis of these disparate high-dimensional immune monitoring assays is imperative but challenging, especially because many visualization tools are either built only for in-house utilization or typically specialize in only one or perhaps a few data types. At the same time, cross-assay or cross-participant data interpretation is the only way to identify relevant immune biomarkers that impact clinical trial design and clinical cancer care. There is thus an unmet need for easy-to-use interactive tools for integrative exploration of cancer patient immune monitoring data by biologists and clinicians. This proposal aims to address this need through the development of a user-friendly, integrative web-based visualization tool, Precision Immunology Monitoring Analysis and Visualization Online (PRIMAVO), that will enable researchers of all computational skill levels to visually analyze and interactively explore immune monitoring assay results that belong to a cancer immunotherapy trial, at multiple levels of granularity. The PRIMAVO tool will scale with current and future data growth and complexity to enable fast and effective research towards identifying associations between different data types, participants, and clinical variables. We hypothesize that developing (i) cohort-level; and (ii) participant-level visualizations that integrate views across multiple immune data types, participants, cohorts and time points will provide a deep, comprehensive view of events; and that (iii) the content and features of PRIMAVO will be greatly enhanced by engaging with the user community during its development. The results from this highly integrated effort will have important clinical and public health implications by accelerating our understanding of the immune responses of cancer patients to immunotherapies and significantly impact the rate at which immune biomarkers from clinical trials will be identified, interpreted, verified and translated into clinically actionable findings. Overall, PRIMAVO will be a highly valuable tool for the research community.	16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Address;Antigens;Award;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Cancer Patient;Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Colitis;Communication;Communities;Computer Analysis;Custom;Cytometry;Data;Data Analyses;Data Commons;Data Set;Development;Dimensions;Disease;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Event;Feedback;Flow Cytometry;Future;Grant;Growth;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunologic Markers;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunology;Immunooncology;Immunotherapy;Infrastructure;Interview;Malignant Neoplasms;Metagenomics;Minority;Mission;Monitor;Mutation;Online Systems;Output;Participant;Patients;Principal Component Analysis;Proteomics;Public Health;Research;Research Personnel;Serology;Shotguns;Standardization;Surveys;Technology;Time;Toxic effect;Translating;Visual;Visualization;Visualization software;analysis pipeline;anticancer research;base;biomarker discovery;cancer care;cancer immunotherapy;clinical practice;clinical trial participant;clinically actionable;cohort;data exploration;data visualization;demographics;design;diverse data;exome;experience;flexibility;high dimensionality;immune checkpoint blockade;immune-related adverse events;immunotherapy clinical trials;immunotherapy trials;improved;interactive tool;interest;medical schools;microbiome analysis;novel marker;novel therapeutics;response;response biomarker;side effect;skills;tool;tool development;transcriptome sequencing;treatment response;tumor;user-friendly;web-based tool	ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Zeynep Hulya Gumus	DCB	DAVID J MILLER	1542450	>=$1M	1542450	23-Sep-2021	23-Sep-2021	31-Aug-2025	RFA-CA-20-044	Moonshot
project	1R37CA230617-01A1	R37CA230617	9683816	2019	Hormone signaling and translation control in advanced prostate cancer	Grant	ABSTRACT The recent advent of highly potent inhibitors of the androgen receptor and androgen biosynthesis has had the unfortunate iatrogenic effect of fueling new lethal prostate cancer phenotypes in patients. In particular, non- neuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an aggressive form of this disease, is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The main barriers against therapeutic advances are a paucity of relevant disease models and a very poor understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to this phenotype. The process of protein synthesis has long been considered subordinate to alterations at the levels of DNA and RNA in cancer etiology. However, work from our laboratory and others have revealed that protein synthesis control is a dynamic process that coordinates not only bulk mRNA translation, but also the specialized translation of distinct mRNAs important for cancer phenotypes. Recently, our laboratory has developed and characterized a new in vitro and in vivo toolkit of both human and murine androgen receptor-low CRPC. We have used these models to discover a critical link between androgen receptor signaling and the process of mRNA translation initiation, which is critical for androgen receptor-low CRPC growth. We hypothesize that androgen receptor-low CRPC is driven by the specific translation of distinct mRNA networks, thereby leading to persistent tumor growth, which may represent a therapeutic vulnerability. Our long-term objective is to utilize state-of-the-art mouse models, ribosome profiling, and patient derived xenografts to definitively investigate the fundamental link between the androgen receptor and protein synthesis control in a highly relevant and newly emerging disease course for prostate cancer patients. To do so, we will address the following aims: 1) determine the mechanism by which the androgen receptor communicates with the translation apparatus, 2) delineate how aberrant protein synthesis drives the translation of distinct oncogenic mRNAs, and 3) elucidate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting translation initiation in androgen receptor-low CRPC. Ultimately, these studies are poised to uncover a new paradigm for gene regulation in androgen receptor-low prostate cancer and provide the preclinical basis for targeting the protein synthesis apparatus in an increasingly common highly aggressive disease.

With the recent success of anti-viral therapies, the etiology of HCC in the American population is projected to shift from viral (HBV, HCV) hepatitis to primarily fatty liver disease in the near future. Currently, only one effective systemic therapy has been developed for HCC – the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib. The development of more selective molecularly targeted therapies has so far been unsuccessful in this disease. This failure is due in part to the lack of a preclinical, patient-derived xenograft (PDX)- enabling HCC tumor bank drawn from an American HCC patient population to help patient selection and model new therapies. In addition, modeling underlying liver disease has rarely been pursued in preclinical drug development. PDX-enabling tumor banks exist in Asia, but tend to be from viral and alcohol-driven disease, as opposed to obesity, which is the driver of growing incidence in the West. Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) has begun collecting primary patient HCC tumors from surgeries performed in Boston and will partner with Woodland Pharmaceuticals, the applicant, to expand these into a PDX resource better enabling new HCC therapy development. Woodland will expand the tumors to up to five passages in mice and then characterize the passages for drug sensitivity, both in vitro and in vivo to a panel of drugs. Demonstration of stable expansion will lead to a phase 2 application to further expand and characterize the HCC tumor bank (including tracking of patient treatment and outcomes at the academic site), in models with underlying liver disease, in readiness for PDX service commercialization in the USA.

project	1R41CA217503-01	R41CA217503	9346494	2017	Therapeutic disruption of Connexin43-mediated microtubule regulation to target glioblastoma cancer stem cells	Grant	Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal incurable human diseases. Even with aggressive therapies including surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy using temozolomide (TMZ), the median survival for GBM patients is only 14 months. In fact, GBM cancer cells are highly infiltrative and comprise a sub- population of glioma stem cells (GSCs) with tumorigenic properties regulated by the tumor microenvironment, and often resistant to chemotherapy and irradiation treatments. The remaining GSCs can then enter an active state of self-renewal, and asymmetric division that recapitulates the heterogeneous tumor. As a result, all treated GBM patients will experience tumor recurrence and subsequent surgeries and toxic radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens are harmful for the patient and often remain insufficient. There is therefore an urgent need for new therapeutic drug to target GSCs and treat this devastating disease. Glioblastoma resistance to TMZ correlates with the expression of the gap junction protein Connexin43 (Cx43), a protein which enables communication between cells, and increased levels of Cx43 are observed in GSCs. The function of Cx43, is not limited to forming channels for the passage of ions and small molecules between cells, but also participates in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. Therefore, targeting Cx43 activity holds promise to treat GBM and prevent tumor recurrence. In this proposed research we use a novel Cx43 mimetic peptide named JM2 (juxtamembrane 2) that encompasses the microtubule binding sequence of Cx43. Our preliminary data show that JM2 alters Cx43 binding to microtubule, decreases the formation of Cx43 gap junctions, and inhibits cell- cell communication in GSCs. Most importantly, we reveal the therapeutic potential of JM2 in decreasing GSC survival in vitro and in vivo. With the goal of developing a new therapy based upon JM2 to target GSCs in GBM, our overall objective is to generate JM2-loaded polyanhydride biodegradable nanoparticles (JM2-NPs) for sustained delivery of JM2 to GSCs. We will use high-resolution microscopy techniques including stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and biochemistry assays to analyze the effect of JM2-NPs in GSCs derived from human primary GBM cells freshly isolated from dissected patient tumor. Finally, we will assess the therapeutic effect of JM2-NPs on GSCs ex vivo using a three dimensional patient GBM-derived organoid model, and in vivo using an orthotopic GBM mouse model. These results will validate the potent effect of JM2 peptide for treatment of high Cx43/chemoresistant GSCs and present a therapeutic opportunity to prevent GBM tumor recurrence. The proposed research is significant because this innovative approach will not only allow us to develop novel therapies for lethal GBM but also will lay foundation on potential clinical trials in newly diagnosed GBM patients in the near future. Finally, our new JM2-loaded nanoparticles may be scalable to other CNS diseases that could benefit from targeting Cx43-microtubule interaction.

The diagnostic power of advanced imaging techniques could benefit tremendously from improved contrast agents that rapidly and selectively accumulate in the tumor lesions and provide high tumor-to-normal tissue ratios, as well as minimizing exposure of patients to radiation by lowering injected activity of the reagents. We propose to develop novel contrast agents for use in breast cancer imaging that can enhance image resolution by selectively targeting and delivering imaging probes directly into tumor lesions with little or no accumulation in the surrounding normal tissue. We have developed an antibody-based delivery platform that exploits a caveloae-mediated transvascular transport pathway to target and rapidly deliver cargo across the restrictive vascular endothelium directly into tumor lesions following intravenous injection. We propose to conjugate 99mTc via a chelating moiety to the targeting antibody (mAnnA1) and to test the resulting imaging probe in rodent models that will include induced metastatic and spontaneous breast tumors. We will optimize the imaging protocol by studying biodistribution of the reagent and determine key parameters in order to characterize selectivity and targeting specificity of the novel reagent.

Despite tremendous efforts, results of clinical trials using tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or engineered CAR-T cells in human solid tumors have not produced desired therapeutic responses. In solid tumors, there are multiple barriers that prevent cytotoxic T cells reaching tumor cells. First, abnormal blood vessels limit T cell delivery into solid tumors, especially tumor center. The presence of dense tumor stromal cells and extracellular matrix create a physical barrier that traps T cells in an immunosuppressive stroma microenvironment. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop novel approaches to improve delivery efficiency of cytotoxic T cells in solid tumors. The translational goal of the proposed phase I research is to develop and validate a stroma-breaking therapeutic T cell delivery system for immunotherapy in human solid tumors with a focus on pancreatic and colon cancers. We have developed a receptor targeted and stroma breaking drug delivery platform with novel designs to overcome tumor stromal cellular and extracellular matrix barriers. We have demonstrated its ability to deliver nanoparticle-drug crossing tumor vessels, migrating through tumor stroma, and penetrating the basement membrane to reach tumor cells. This recombinant targeting ligand consists of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) binding domain of uPA fused with the catalytic domain of matrix metalloproteinase-14 (ATFmmp14). Our preliminary results showed that co-delivery of T cells with ATFmmp14 ligands led to significant increases in the numbers of T cells delivered in tumors following intravenous delivery in mouse colon and pancreatic tumor models as well as a human colon cancer patient derived xenograft (PDX) model. In this phase I project, we aim to determine the effect of ATFmmp14-T cell delivery system on intratumoral delivery and distribution using the MHC-non-restricted cytotoxic ɣδ T cells as a T cell model system in human colon and pancreatic cancer PDX models. First, we will develop the best formulation of ATFmmp14 conjugated T cell delivery platform using ɣδ T cells obtained from healthy donors in human pancreatic and colon PDX models (Aim1). Next, we will determine whether ATFmmp14 ligand can improve selective delivery of ɣδ T cells into pancreatic and colon PDX tumors and promote cell migration through stroma and basement membrane barriers to reach tumor cells (Aim 2). Biodistribution and systemic toxicity in normal organs and tissues will also be evaluated (Aim 2). Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of targeted delivery of ɣδ T cells without or with the combination of a chemotherapy drug will be determined in pancreatic and colon PDX models (Aim 3). Results of the above proposed studies should allow us building a strong foundation for conducting further translational studies in the Phase II research project to bring this approach into a clinical trial. Result of this study will also lead to future development and commercialization of this unique approach for other adaptive T transfer therapies, such as CAR-T, tumor specific T cells, and tumor infiltrating T cells.

project	1R41CA250779-01	R41CA250779	10009836	2020	A Novel Strategy for Diagnosis of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.	Grant	Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is one of two major types of esophageal cancer, which causes 509,000 deaths worldwide annually. EAC diagnosis is made using the invasive, expensive, risky, and not universally accessible procedure, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Thus, there is a pressing need for easier, safer, cheaper strategies for EAC diagnosis. Our novel strategy builds on exciting preliminary data in EAC patients involves a swallowable, retrievable sponge capsule device combined with a DNA methylation biomarker panel (JHU patent pending). Capsulomics, a new startup established specifically for this project, will commercialize this diagnostic assay, termed “EsoSAVE,” for EAC detection.  This Phase I STTR application contains three Specific Aims to implement this strategy. Aim 1 will optimize and validate the EsophaCap DNA extraction procedure. Aim 2 will generate a multi-parameter statistical model to further strengthen our promising methylation biomarkers. Aim 3 will validate the EsoSAVE test in sponge samples from normal and EAC patients. These Aims will address important scientific questions while simultaneously advancing the EsoSAVE diagnostic test toward commercial implementation.

project	1R41CA261451-01A1	R41CA261451	10323774	2021	Analyzing the efficacy of MMP-13 inhibitors in the treatment of CIPN	Grant	Project Summary The goal of this project is to establish an effective drug candidate to treat chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately 400,000 (or ~60-70%) of patients undergoing chemotherapy suffer from CIPN. These patients may need to terminate chemotherapy treatment if experiencing symptoms, such as numbness, pain, temperature sensitivity, or tingling. Cancer survivors furthermore often have to live with CIPN for the rest of their lives. To date are no treatments available with which to tackle this problem. CIPN costs the healthcare system upward of $13B annually for long-term care of the patients. Thus, there is a significant clinical and economical need to develop drug therapies. Avantyx Pharmaceuticals, LLC has identified a new compound targeting the Matrix-Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), which was shown to promote the degeneration of sensory nerve endings in animal models for CIPN induced by paclitaxel treatment. The key focus of this Phase I project is to characterize a novel MMP-13 inhibitor for its bioavailability, efficacy, specificity, and toxicity in a rat model of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy, which is following studies in which we established the efficacy of this inhibitor in zebrafish. Key goals are to establish parameters, such as optimal route of administration (oral or topical), optimal dosing, and target specificity, which is necessary to proceed to further drug development studies in Phase II.

project	1R42CA228875-01	R42CA228875	9558406	2018	Targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells with custom-designed viral vectors	Grant	Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of adult brain cancers with a median survival of <15 months despite aggressive standard chemoradiation. GBM are formed by GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) - a major contributor to tumor recurrence and a natural focus for therapeutic development. There are two main reasons responsible for treatment failure: 1) high intra- and inter-tumor cellular and molecular heterogeneity with multiple subclones possessing distinct genetic determinants; 2) GSCs exhibit multiple redundant signaling pathways requiring simultaneous targeting of overlapping pathways. We have invented and biologically validated a novel tandem computational platform, GeneRep-nSCORE that integrates large-scale gene expression profiles with genomic changes to identify common founding alterations or master regulators of GSCs that span a large number, if not all, GSC subclones within and across GBM tumors. We discovered such a core set of four common master regulators in GCSs that are outstanding targets for clinical development. Expression of these four factors was sufficient to reprogram normal astrocytes to GSCs, whereas their depletion profoundly abrogated GSCs, and thus tumor development in vivo, in all eight lines of patient-derived GSCs of varied genetic and molecular backgrounds examined to date. The goal of this application is to develop a customized set of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based genetic tools to target the whole spectrum of GSCs (Phase I) for the purpose of delivering targeting constructs to deplete the four common master regulators responsible for malignant transformation and proliferation in GSCs (Phase II). The specific objectives of this proposal are: (i) using directed evolution and available combinatorial AAV capsid library, and for the first time, introducing a dynamic mode of administration of a library reagent over the time course of tumor progression, to greatly increase the probability of identifying novel AAV variants specifically targeting slow-, and fast-cycling GSCs in patient-derived xenograft models (PDX) (Phase I); (ii) To design and validate a panel of AAV vectors that express shRNAs targeting core master regulators of GSCs to identify leads for preclinical testing; (iii) To optimize modes of viral delivery, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters, and safety and toxicity in normal and PDX treated with lead targeting AAV cassettes; and (iv) Based on these results, tools and basic DMPK data created, to conduct preclinical efficacy studies in PDX treated with lead targeting AAV cassettes either alone or in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy (Phase II) to prepare for an investigative new drug application for clinical testing in patients with GBM, and for commercial development of this novel technology.

The goal of this Fast-Track STTR is to develop a new specific imaging agent for diagnosis, staging, and treatment of the hematological cancer, multiple myeloma (MM). MM is the 2nd most common blood cancer with an estimated 32,000 new cases and 13,000 deaths per year. Accurate detection is critical for enhancing survival in MM patients. Traditional skeletal survey and bone scans have sensitivity limitations for osteolytic lesions manifested in MM. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) performed with a PET radiopharmaceutical (imaging agent) is a sensitive, quantitative and non-invasive clinical imaging technology to accurately detect, localize and phenotype MM cells throughout the body. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the only FDA-approved PET imaging agent for MM. Unfortunately, MM cells express low levels of GLUT-1 transporter and hexokinase, which are required for FDG uptake and retention. Additionally MM bone marrow harbors FDG-avid inflammatory cells. There is an unmet need for molecularly targeted, sensitive and specific MM imaging agents that can accurately stage and restage MM, identify high-risk MM patients, guide personalized MM treatment, and evaluate clinical response to treatment. The product of this STTR will be a specific and sensitive PET imaging agent (64Cu-LLP2A) for MM. Published data and ongoing first-in-human trial results have significantly informed the Phase I and II aims of this proposal. The Phase I Segment consists of two specific aims: (1) Perform dose escalation and single dose toxicity testing in mice. (2) Compile data for new dose and submit amendment of eIND to FDA. Three milestones will be met in Phase I: (1) A new mass will be selected based on no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), i.e. clinical signs of organ toxicity (vehicle vs experimental). (2) Based on the new determined mass, and in vivo preclinical image quality data, a new specific activity (Ci/mol) will be established. (3) Obtain FDA approval of Sarya sponsored amended eIND application. The Phase II segment involves a clinical trial and has one specific aim: Quantify the efficacy of 64Cu-LLP2A-PET imaging for detecting active MM in humans in a prospective imaging trial. Phase II milestones are: (1) Demonstrate high detection rates (% of scans that are positive for a focal lesion, p<0.05) for 64Cu-LLP2A versus FDG in MM patients. (2) Accuracy of 64Cu-LLP2A for active MM will be assessed using standard-of-care bone marrow (BM) biopsies and serum biomarker M-protein levels as the standards of reference. A correlation coefficient of 0.7 will be considered reasonably strong. In summary, Phase I will prove feasibility that 64Cu-LLP2A is tolerable with NOAEL resulting in a new eIND. Phase II will provide 64Cu-LLP2A-PET preliminary performance data to support a New Drug Application for 64Cu-LLP2A as a New Molecular Entity (NME) for FDA approval of Phase 2 clinical trials.

project	1R43CA246766-01	R43CA246766	9902864	2019	Protease Activated Masked Interferon to Treat Malignancy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT IFN and IFN (type I) and IFN (type II) are potent mediators of anti-cancer immunity having both direct anti- proliferative effects against many cancers as well as a multitude of anti-tumor immunotherapeutic effects. However, while IFN has efficacy against multiple human cancers its clinical utility to date has been limited by the inability to achieve effective concentrations of IFN at tumor sites without causing systemic toxicity. Several groups including ours have successfully approached this problem by using the tumor-targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to carry IFNs directly to tumor sites. These approaches have shown great promise and anti-CD20-IFN2 is in clinical trials by ImmunGene and anti-CD138-IFN2 is being developed by Qwixel Therapeutics under a license from UCLA. Although using the antibody binding specificity to target tumor- associated antigens delivers a greater percentage of the IFN to the site of the tumor than is achieved when IFN is injected by itself, the attached interferon still is recognized and bound by interferon receptors expressed throughout the body that are not tumor associated. This binding can result both in less IFN reaching the tumor and in unwanted off-target toxicity. The goal of the present studies will be to produce anti-IFN fusion proteins in which the IFN will only bind IFN receptors once it reaches the tumor. To achieve that goal we will attach a mask to the IFN, which will inhibit its activity. This mask will be separated from the IFN by a peptide linker that is a site for proteolytic cleavage. A hallmark of cancer is increased proteolytic activity in tumor tissue and the surrounding microenvironment. We therefore hypothesize that we can achieve improved tumor targeting of IFN activity by producing it as a prodrug that will be activated only in the tumor microenvironment following removal of the mask by the tumor associated proteases. Preliminary studies have identified a potential mask and cleavable peptide linker for IFN. We will now use tumor cell lines and extracts to confirm that the mask inhibits IFNα activity, that it can be removed within the tumor microenvionment and that the unmasked protein is now active both in vitro and in xenograft models. Humanized NSG mice will be used to determine if the masked interferon fusion protein elicits a decreased inflammatory response compared to unmasked IFN. Similar approaches will be used to produce a masked IFN using either a peptide or scFv mask. The resulting masked IFN will be characterized as will be done for IFN. With the successful completion of these experiments, Qwixel will have novel IFN fusion proteins that are even more effective in delivering large amounts of IFN to tumor sites in the absence of systemic toxicity.

project	1R44CA217528-01A1	R44CA217528	9410312	2017	Novel Fluorescent Diagnostic Agents for Detection, Staging, andIntraoperative Imaging of Tumors	Grant	Abstract The goal of this project is to develop IV injectable fluorescent agents for use in intraoperative imaging of peritoneal metastatic tumors. Significance: Peritoneal metastatic cancers have an incidence of 250,000/per year in the US and are primarily treated with surgery. Complete surgical tumor resection is a gold-standard treatment goal that can increase the 5-year patient survival to 50%, whereas incomplete tumor resection (<2mm) could drastically reduce the survival to a mere few months. Current clinical imaging technologies such as PET, MRI and CT have limitations for guiding cancer surgery including inability to be used intraoperatively due to safety associated with ionizing radiation, as well as limitations on sensitivity and tumor specificity especially for lesions smaller than 10mm. Conventional fluorescent molecular probes in development typically target tumor proteins and are limited in imaging the heterogeneous onco-geno-phenotypes of peritoneal metastasis that have multiple tissues of origin and vary in protein expression levels. In order to reduce incomplete tumor resection and improve survival, there is an urgent need for clear visual contrast imaging agents that enable more precise and specific detection of peritoneal metastasis tumors intraoperatively and in real-time. Hypothesis: OncoNano’s approach of targeting tumor acidosis which is ubiquitously expressed as a cancer biomarker across tumors, coupled with OncoNano’s ultra-sensitive pH fluorescent digital sensors, provides a broad based approach to image the heterogeneous peritoneal metastasis with high specificity and sensitivity. Preliminary Data: We have demonstrated that OncoNano’s fluorescent agents image tumors across a variety of solid tumor types (14 tested to date), including peritoneal metastasis to submillimeter precision in SCID mouse models. OncoNano’s agents provided a digital (ON-OFF) response which offered clear tumor delineation, and lower detection limits (>10x) compared with state of the art PET-FDG imaging. Surgical tumor resection using OncoNano imaging agent showed significant (40-50%) survival benefit in SCID mouse models compared with conventional white light based surgery. Specific Aims: The scientific aims of this project will enable OncoNano to clinically translate, the ultrasensitive pH probes and develop it from the lab bench through to establishing reproducible manufacturing of a stable formulation, to establishing safety and pharmacology, for an FDA IND filing. The specific aims in the SBIR Phase I, addresses the nanoprobe stability requirement, and addresses the nanoprobe sensitivity and specificity requirement in in-vivo models. The specific aims in Phase 2 of the project addresses the critical milestones on the path to clinical translation including- the scale-up requirement to meet the GLP and human testing needs, a demonstration of product safety in GLP in-vivo studies, culminating in an IND filing with the FDA.

project	1R44CA221624-01	R44CA221624	9409833	2017	Monitoring immune response to immunotherapies in cancer patients with VisAcT PET tracer	Grant	Abstract CellSight is a clinical stage company developing PET imaging tools that can increase the probability of clinical success of immunotherapies by determining early in the therapeutic regimen if the cancer patient is responding to their immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapies that harness the body's immune system to help fight cancer do not work for everyone; in fact, success rates can be as low as 20%. This means that up to 80% of patients undergoing immunotherapy are spending over $100,000 and investing 6 to 10 months on ineffective treatments. Our lead imaging tracer, [18F]-FAraG product named VisAcT, leverages existing health and PET imaging infrastructure but is specific for visualizing immune response. This whole body visualization will provide clinicians critical information to help make early decisions in the treatment regimen and increase chances of patient survival. CellSight is partnering with pharma and academia on various projects to validate this critically needed immune response monitoring tool as immunotherapies and combinational therapies are showing great promise. The sheer number of combinations are staggering yet there are no blood biomarkers or imaging tools available that can be predictive of responders versus nonresponders. Even if accurate blood biomarkers were to became available in the near future, whole body imaging will still be critically needed to determine local immune response site by site in the metastatic patient who are the ones being administered immunotherapies. Clinical symptoms during immunotherapy are very perplexing, as it might seem a patient is progressing when in fact their immune system is actively fighting the cancer or there might be a delay before immune response is apparent through traditional measures. An immune response monitoring tool, such as VisAcT, will be key in enabling success for immunotherapies. VisAcT was first discovered and developed in the Gambhir lab (Chair of Radiology at Stanford) and is exclusively licensed to CellSight. CellSight has obtained an IND primarily through funding from the NCI. We are currently conducting Phase 1 clinical trials at University of California San Francisco for various solid tumors including Melanoma, Lung and Bladder under Drs, Daud, Gubens and Fong respectively and are about to launch a Head/Neck cancer trial at Stanford under Dr. Colevas. Our primary target market is the immuno-oncology market however since the tracer shows immune response that is specific to activated T cells it can be useful for other immune modulated diseases such as Graft vs Host Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Our team, including Michael Karin, Ph.D. and Shabnam Shalapour, Ph.D. at UCSD School of Medicine and Hidekazu Tsukamoto, D.V.M., Ph.D. and Anthony El-Khoueiry, M.D. at USC Keck School of Medicine, represents an ideal blend of basic researchers, translational scientists and oncologists who are interested in HCC molecular pathogenesis and treatment, especially in HCC caused by non-alcoholic (NASH) and alcoholic (ASH) steatohepatitis. Although the US incidence of HCC and its associated mortality have nearly tripled in the past generation, insufficient effort has been made toward identification and development of innovative and effective HCC therapies. However, the ideal and timely confluence of basic preclinical research and applied clinical studies carried out by our team members has the potential to critically transform HCC treatment forever. Together we found that chronic liver inflammation results in suppression of HCC-protective immunosurveillance to support rapid malignant progression. This unique immunopathogenic mechanism renders HCC responsive to drugs that disrupt the PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint, but even the impressive response seen thus far and the selection of patients who will benefit from this therapeutic approach can be further improved. Such improvements can only be achieved by a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitors act, the factors that determine their efficacy, and the causes of treatment failure. We will achieve these goals through integrated studies of clinical specimens collected by Dr. El-Khoueiry and sophisticated, faithful and robust mouse models of non-viral HCC developed by Drs. Tsukamoto, Shalapour, and Karin. The immune mechanisms that control NASH- and ASH-driven HCC development in these models are highly similar to those that operate in human patients. Using this integrated approach, we will pursue five specific aims: 1) determine whether serum IgA concentrations correlate with therapeutic response to PD-1 blockade in patients with non-viral HCC; 2) develop reliable mouse models of ASH-driven HCC; 3) compare the immunosuppressive mechanisms that contribute to development of NASH- and ASH-driven HCC and control their response to PD-L1 blockade; 4) determine whether excessive peritumoral fibrosis correlates with diminished response to PD-1 blockade in HCC patients; and 5) determine whether agents that inhibit or attenuate stellate cell activation potentiate the response to PD- 1/PD-L1 blockade in non-viral HCC. The successful completion of these studies will result in substantial improvements to HCC immunotherapy and will establish reliable procedures for identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 targeting drugs, advances that will result in significant cost savings which may amount to hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

Grant	U01 Abstract Despite extensive research into cancer immunotherapy, immune-related adverse events (irAE) remain a critical and poorly understood issue. To address this critical need, we have assembled a multidisciplinary research team with broad and relevant expertise. The co-PIs of this proposal have expertise in cancer immunotherapy, immunology, assay development, and bioinformatics. Together, we have assembled a cohort of ~400 cancer patients treated with ICI, collecting longitudinal treatment, efficacy, and toxicity data, as well as blood samples at pre-treatment baseline, throughout therapy, and at time of toxicity. In our real-world data set, over 10 percent of cases have a history of autoimmune disease, providing insight into use of ICI in a population widely excluded from clinical trials yet routinely treated with these therapies off protocol. Our high-quality clinical data annotation—without which correlative studies have little meaning—addresses the reality that irAE may occur months after ICI initiation and are far more complex to detect and characterize than toxicities of conventional chemotherapy or molecularly targeted therapies. Through existing funding mechanisms, we have already completed autoantibody, cytokine, genetic, and functional assays in these cases. However, we do not currently have resources for comprehensive, integrated analysis of these diverse laboratory and clinical data. The overarching goal of this U01 proposal is to determine the optimal balance between ICI efficacy and toxicity, ultimately identifying a set of biomarkers useful for selection of patients, treatment type and duration, and clinical monitoring. We will achieve this through determination of cellular immunity, comprehensive data analysis, and clinical validation. We have three Aims: (1) Determine cellular immunity in patients experiencing irAE and/or achieving beneficial responses from ICI. We will perform mass cytometry (CyTOF) and T-cell receptor sequencing at multiple time-points. (2) Determine genetic, humoral, and cellular factors associated with irAE and/or beneficial responses from ICI. We will develop a database to integrate and analyze the CyTOF and T-cell receptor sequencing data with clinical efficacy and toxicity data, as well as data from the assays already completed through other mechanisms. (3) Perform analytical and clinical validation of emerging biomarkers. We will apply the best classifying phenotypes emerging from our comprehensive and integrated data analysis to a test set of patients from our existing cohort, eventually identifying a subset of biomarkers with potential for clinical application. Together, these Aims directly address the FOA purpose of reducing the incidence and/or severity of irAE while retaining anti- tumor efficacy.

This increasingly accurate mutational landscape has led to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic interventions. However, there is widespread biological and clinical heterogeneity in tumors, even when they share the same driver oncogene mutation. In addition, a high degree of dynamic plasticity and adaptability makes cancers display complex patterns of acquired resistance that manifest clinically. In a similar way, the wide variability of clinical responses to immunotherapy and the onset of immune escape, are becoming a formidable obstacle to fully realize the potential of many new and potentially effective immunotherapies. In this project we will evaluate a rational systematic approach to characterize oncogenic states and their most salient genomic and immune hallmarks in order to infer optimal combinations of pharmacologic and immunological perturbagens that disrupt cancer cell and tumor microenvironment interaction and viability. Our approach is based on our preliminary data, which suggests that in each identifiable oncogenic state there is a close interplay between activation of oncogenic elements, cellular pathways and the immune microenvironment. The project will test this approach with three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Characterize 5-10 pan-cancer oncogenic states with well-defined genomic and immune hallmarks including their specific molecular targets and sensitivity to perturbagens. Aim 2. Computationally infer optimal combinations of pharmacological and immunological perturbagens. Aim 3. Experimentally validate single and combinations of perturbagens identified in Aim 2. This innovative approach will provide a rich source of CTD2 datasets and resources including a catalog of oncogenic states, their most salient genomic and immune hallmarks, associated targets and validated combinations of pharmacologic and immune therapies that are effective at targeting tumors. These results will lead directly to the development of clinical trials, novel treatment strategies and provide the foundation for a new generation of more comprehensive, functional-based, precision medicine approaches.    	Anatomy;Antibodies;Bayesian Method;Biological;Cancer Vaccines;Cancer cell line;Catalogs;Cell Survival;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Communities;Complex;Computer Simulation;Data;Data Set;Development;Elements;Epitopes;Foundations;Gene Expression;Generations;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Human;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immunologics;Immunotherapy;Knock-out;Lead;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Molecular Target;Mutation;Natural Killer Cells;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Pharmacology;Resistance;Resources;Signal Pathway;Solid Neoplasm;Source;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Treatment Efficacy;Xenograft procedure;anticancer research;base;cancer cell;cancer classification;cancer genome;chimeric antigen receptor;clinical development;immune checkpoint;innovation;mouse model;mutational status;new therapeutic target;novel;precision medicine;predictive modeling;response;synergism;targeted treatment;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO	LA JOLLA	CA	UNITED STATES	Ezra  Cohen,Dan S Kaufman,JILL P.

This is particularly true for glioblastoma (GBM) where prognosis  has increased only by 2-3 months over the last 75 years with a 5-year survival of less than 4%. Many promising  preclinical studies have failed to live up to expectations when tested clinically. This problem is likely due to: a)  limitations of the preclinical model system and b) lack of reliable biomarkers for proper patient selection. To  address these issues, investigators are increasingly utilizing patient-­derived models of cancer (PDMC) coupled  with comprehensive molecular profiling. However, differences in model composition, growth conditions, and  other microenvironmental factors limit reliability of these models and hamper interpretation. We believe that a  careful investigation of tumor microenvironmental (TME) stressors on 3 patient­derived models (xenolines) of  GBM, namely xenografts (PDX), spheroid cultures (neurospheres), and human biomatrix embedded 3D  microtumors, will provide insight into critical aspects of tumor biology that are influenced by model and TME.  These models pre­ and post­ TME perturbagen will also be comprehensively profiled at the genomic,  transcriptomic, and kinomic (global kinase activity assessment through a peptide substrate microarray) level to  generate a similarity distance metric. We hypothesize that application of TME stressors to the PDMC’s will  improve both molecular and biological fidelity of the respective models to that of the original tumor or parent  xenoline that can be visualized and in silico tested using an advanced computational data modeling system  (GeneTerrain). Our preliminary data generated from prior NIH funded projects indicate that our existing xenolines  recapitulate all four molecular subtypes of GBM identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas while reproducing the  key hallmarks of GBM when implanted orthotopically in immunocompromised mice. Importantly, we can grow  disaggregated xenoline tumors in a novel three-dimensional (3D) culture system incorporating many cells of the  tumor microenvironment to produce 3D microtumors suitable for higher throughput drug testing. Moreover, we  have preliminary evidence that TME manipulation of BTICs or 3D microtumors (e.g., hypoxia or nutrient  deprivation) promotes a more aggressive tumor phenotype in vitro and in vivo that is accompanied by changes  in kinomic signatures. Therefore, we will: 1) Generate 3 PDMC models from existing xenolines as well as de  novo GBM patient tumors with comprehensive omic testing to calculate similarity distance metrics among the  models with corresponding biological assessments including growth, chemoradiation sensitivity, and stemness  markers;; 2) Perform TME perturbagen testing of the derivative PDMCs (neurospheres and 3D microtumors) and  determine impact on tumor biology and similarity distance metric;; 3) Develop and validate GeneTerrain models  of the various PDMCs with respect to TME and therapeutic sensitivity (radiation and temozolomide).

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie “microtumors”) and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.

project	1U01CA224146-01	U01CA224146	9449587	2017	Systematic interrogation of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment in patient-derived specimens	Grant	Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 8%. Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional evaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to investigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and improve immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in PDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME and identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating disease.

Pet dogs share their environment, and oftentimes their diet, with their owners. Dogs and humans develop sporadic benign and malignant brain tumors at about the same rate and with similar histopathology. Dogs are often euthanized due to the cost of care. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people as well as pets through comparative oncology and genomics and the “One Medicine” approach to research and direct clinical application. We propose a multi-institutional consortium to test an innovative combinatorial immunotherapeutic approach in dogs that spontaneously and sporadically develop malignant glial brain tumors that resemble in most important aspects, high-grade malignant gliomas in humans. Our approach will inject a clinical grade oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV) M032 that expresses human interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the resected tumor bed. Dog lymphocytes fully respond to human IL-12 [1] and oncolytic HSV infect and kill canine (as well as mouse, non-human primate, human) tumor cells, creating a potent local inflammatory response and an antigen-rich tumor cell debris field. Therefore, we would anticipate that this virally-based immunotherapeutic approach would likely be as effective in dogs with brain tumors as in humans with brain tumors. We will conduct longitudinal safety, survival and correlative biology evaluations as a means of assessing the dog as an appropriate and informative model for design and implementation of clinical studies in humans with high-grade malignant brain tumors. To extend these findings, we propose, in subsequent studies, to combine the HSV immunotherapy approach with molecules that block the action of innate checkpoint inhibitor(s). These studies are designed to address key issues of safety and efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy in the dog that can be translated to humans with malignant gliomas. Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in humans, accounting for 30% of all primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors in adults. [2] With few major advances in decades, there has been no significant reduction in mortality and only a modest improvement in median survival. Recently, objective responses and long-term survivals have been observed in human glioma patients who have received oncolytic virotherapy and a Phase I trial is currently underway at UAB in patients using M032 alone. New approaches to utilize checkpoint inhibitors promises improved efficacy, but the ability to develop more effective combinatorial approaches has been slow, in large part due to lack of a faithful model of spontaneous glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people and pets through comparative oncology and genomics using the “One Medicine“ approach to research and direct clinical application.

project	1U01CA224153-01	U01CA224153	9449723	2017	Enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy in DLBCL using rational combination approaches	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract While small molecule inhibitors have made an impact in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), immunotherapy, specifically using anti-CD20 based approaches, has had the most profound effect on treatment strategies and long-term outcomes. Despite this progress, up to 40% of patients will ultimately succumb to their disease. Furthermore, even when treatment is successful, cytotoxic chemotherapy carries a high risk of long- term morbidities that impact quality of life. The recent success of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of lymphoma demonstrates the potential for additional progress in long-term disease control of DLBCL, with less toxicity. The molecular and genetic phenotype of canine DLBCL has been studied and it often resembles the activated B cell (ABC) category typically associated with aggressive DLBCL in people. Moreover, there is now substantial data that specific genetic changes and pathway aberrations are conserved across dogs and people with DLBCL supporting the notion that the canine disease can be used as a relevant spontaneous large animal model of the human counterpart. Toward this end, the purpose of this proposal is to use dogs with spontaneous naïve DLBCL to rapidly evaluate rational small molecule/immunotherapy combination approaches, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most effective combination to move forward in human patients with DLBCL. Specifically, we hypothesize that optimal combinations of anti-CD20, anti- PD1, XPO1 inhibition, NAMPT/PAK4 and PI3Kdelta inhibition will have better outcomes than doxorubicin based chemotherapy, resulting in a “chemo-free” blueprint for future human trials. Using an adaptive mini-pilot trial approach, those combinations deemed antagonistic and/or associated with unacceptable adverse events can be rapidly removed from consideration, while those with clear therapeutic promise can be most effectively studied in the front-line setting and enhanced. We will accomplish this by first determining the optimal chemo-free regimen with small molecule/ anti-CD20 combinations, then identifying the optimal chemo-free regimen with small molecule/anti-PD1 combinations and finally, by evaluating a frontline chemo-free novel combination regimen in canine DLBCL to demonstrate superiority to standard R-CHOP-based chemotherapy. Additionally, we will interrogate correlative biomarkers based on RNA sequencing of tumor samples obtained from dogs enrolled into the prospective trials and develop signatures that can be used to predict not only response to therapy, but more importantly long-term progression-free survival. Together, the data generated from this proposal will create a framework for effectively leveraging information gained from integrated immunotherapeutic trials in canine patients with DLBCL to develop chemo-free strategies that ultimately improve human outcomes.

In the field of immunotherapy, dogs offer an innovative model for translational research, as they present many of the challenges faced in “scaling up” therapeutic systems dependent on complex interactions between multiple cell types yet under more controlled settings. They also allow for long-term assessment of efficacy and toxicities. Canine clinical trials offer unique access to a rich source of spontaneously occurring, genetically and immunologically diverse cancers with the benefits of reduced time, expense, and regulatory hurdles of a human trial. The similarities between canine and human cancers are increasingly being realized. The publicly available canine genome has propelled comparative genomics studies that have shown significant homology between dogs and humans for recognized cancer-associated genes including MET, IGF1R, mTOR, and KIT. Not surprisingly, cytogenetic abnormalities that define human cancers, i.e. BCR-Abl translocations in chronic myelogenous leukemia and RB1 deletions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been found in comparable canine cancers. Intracranial neoplasia occurs frequently in dogs with a reported prevalence from 0.15 to 4.5% compared to 18.2 cases per 100,000 human. Astrocytoma or glioma account for 20-36% of primary brain tumors in dogs and 25% in humans. Brachycephalic breeds such as Boxers, French and English bulldogs, and Boston terriers have a significantly increased risk of developing gliomas. Primary canine brain tumors have similar histologic classification as those reported by the World Health Organization for human brain tumors. Similar to that in humans, the prognosis for dogs with brain tumors in general is poor regardless of therapeutic intervention. However, much less is known about canine glioma treatment outcomes because only a small number of studies with few dogs have been reported. There is little information about median survival time for dogs with glioma that received any type of treatment, but estimates of days to 2 or 3 months are often given to owners. The clinical similarities between dogs and humans suggest that dogs may represent an outstanding model for testing targeted therapies; both dogs and humans might benefit from these studies. Herein, we are proposing a multi-pronged immunotherapeutic approach to improve efficacy and survival times. We hypothesize that combination immunotherapy in a canine glioma model will enhance efficacy and accelerate successful translation into phase I human trials for GBM. The objective is to use pet dogs with spontaneous GBM to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of combination immunotherapy. We propose two Specific Aims: 1. Determine the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in spontaneous canine GBM in combination with standard of care, and 2. Assess the efficacy of immune-mediated gene therapy in combination with CD200 blockade to enhance anti-glioma immunotherapy. !

This work is targeted to dogs with typically lethal, naturally occurring osteosarcoma (OSA) and melanoma, and the findings are expected to have important relevance for the design and translation of innovative immunotherapy approaches in humans. Inhaled (IH) IL-15 offers the advantages of local delivery of this immune-stimulatory cytokine, while limiting systemic exposure and thus potential toxicity. Super-agonist IL- 15 offers increased half-life and greater anti-tumor effects. Therefore, each of these cytokines is anticipated to alter the risk/benefit ratio in favor of their use. To accomplish these objectives, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) Targeting gross pulmonary metastases (OSA and melanoma) with first-in-dog delivery of inhaled (IH) human IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15; 2) Phase II trial of IH IL-15 and autologous NK cells to treat gross OSA and melanoma pulmonary metastases, and; 3) Targeting micro-metastatic disease using super- agonist IL-15 in primary OSA. The canine model represents a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy research as an important link between murine models and human clinical studies. Dogs represent an attractive outbred combination of companion animals that experience spontaneous cancer development in the setting of an intact immune system. Importantly, these studies are designed to evaluate novel treatment combinations for advanced pulmonary metastases in the setting of gross disease, but also will determine the impact of this approach as first-line therapy when combined with standard-of-care treatments. Moreover, this work seeks to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate an anti-tumor response (or non-response) in dogs with naturally occurring cancers. We will have the unique opportunity to perform whole exome sequencing and RNASeq on tumor tissue pre- and post-immunotherapy, and we will investigate whether a signature of mutational landscape and gene expression profiles can be developed to prospectively predict outcome and response to immune therapies. We will correlate these data to immunohistochemical, flow cytometry, and serum cytokine readouts for evidence of transition from “cold” to “hot” tumors predictive of favorable long term outcome. Hence, these canine trials and bio-marker studies represent an ideal strategy to inform and facilitate the rapid translation of novel, potentially high impact immune therapies to human patients with aggressive cancers.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies – a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study. This initiative is directly relevant to the primary objective to develop novel biomarkers and T cell antigenic targets for the successful application of immunotherapy in PDAC.

Indeed, canine OS has historically been used to help develop novel limb spare techniques, evaluate a variety of non-specific immunotherapeutics such as L-MTP-PE, and assess the efficacy of targeted therapeutics to prevent the outgrowth of metastatic disease. Despite best efforts, progress in the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease has essentially stalled for the past 3 decades; 30% of people and 90% of dogs still die of tumor spread, primarily to the lungs. Numerous clinical trials have been undertaken in people with macroscopic metastases and in dogs with both microscopic and macroscopic disease, yet all have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes. This is particularly evident with respect to immune checkpoint inhibitors that do not induce the dramatic disease regressions typically observed in other cancers such as melanoma and lung cancer. One particularly daunting challenge for immunotherapy-based therapeutics in OS relates to the permissiveness of the tumor microenvironment (TME) for inducing anti-tumor immune responses. Our data suggests that a relatively low mutational load combined with a dampened overall immune response in OS may contribute to the observed lack of response to current treatment approaches. We propose that targeting the immune suppressive TME in OS is essential to generating potent and durable anti- tumor immunity. To accomplish this, it may be necessary to simultaneously modulate several elements in the TME, including Tregs, MDSCs, M2 macrophages and overexpressed inhibitory checkpoint molecules. In support of this, we have generated a body of data demonstrating immunological activity of multiple therapeutics, including repurposed drugs with good safety records (losartan, oclacitinib), small molecule inhibitors with established PK/PD in dogs (toceranib, RV1001, reparixin, JHU-292) and antibodies specific for checkpoint molecules (anti- PD1). However, the exact combinations that are most effective against metastatic OS have not yet been identified, and this is a major goal of this proposal. As such, we hypothesize that an adaptive pilot trial design can be used to rapidly screen TME-targeting immunotherapy drug combinations in dogs with macroscopic chemotherapy-resistant metastatic OS and that this information can be refined to assess activity of the most active approach against microscopic metastases in a subsequent adjuvant trial. This will be accomplished by testing four TME modifying immunotherapy combinations for anti-tumor and immune modulatory activity in dogs with macroscopic OS metastases, interrogating relevant biomarkers associated with responses to therapy, then using this information to conduct an adjuvant immunotherapy trial with the most active combination in dogs with microscopic metastatic OS. The data generated from this proposal will create a blueprint for future immunotherapy studies in people with OS by eliminating approaches deemed inactive and generating a set of clinical biomarkers to guide treatment.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).

project	1U01CA224348-01	U01CA224348	9457862	2017	Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy	Grant	We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan, can enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS 2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include “normalization” of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy – FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium. Through this work, we will develop innovative approaches to enhance anti-tumor immunity in this intractable disease.

project	1U01CA224766-01	U01CA224766	9471276	2018	Protective Role of Nonclassical Monocytes in Immunotherapies for Solid Cancers	Grant	Nonclassical monocytes (identified as CD14dimCD16+ in humans) exhibit a unique ability to `patrol' or survey the luminal side of the vascular endothelium both at steady state and during inflammation. Nonclassical monocytes function in circulation to aid in removing pathogens and debris from the vasculature. We recently found that nonclassical monocytes function in the vasculature to prevent tumor metastasis by orchestrating the killing and clearance of metastasizing tumor cells. The anti-tumor immune potential of nonclassical patrolling monocytes is in contrast to the growing evidence for pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic functions of myeloid cells in many tumor types. In the current proposal, we hypothesize that nonclassical monocytes function in an anti-tumoral manner to support CAR T cell expansion and efficacy in patients with solid tumors. Thus, one major goal of our proposal is to determine whether monocyte therapy using anti-tumoral nonclassical monocytes in combination with existing CAR T immunotherapy would improve efficacy. We will use mass cytometry to study monocyte subsets in cancer patients to identify new markers that will help readily determine how successful a proposed immunotherapy may be for patients. Aim 1 will identify unique markers of nonclassical monocytes in multiply relapsed sarcoma patients versus healthy subjects using mass cytometry. Aim 1 will be performed using banked samples from the existing GD2 CAR T trial at the NIH Clinical Center. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that nonclassical monocytes play a functional role in promoting anti-tumor immunity when used in combination with immunotherapy for solid tumor metastasis. Aim 2 will use both xenografted humanized mouse and syngeneic mouse tumor models. Aim 3 will study the safety and preliminary efficacy of CAR T cell immunotherapy in combination with nonclassical monocyte cell therapy for patients with multiple relapsed, metastatic or progressive pediatric solid tumors. In Aim 3, we will initiate a second generation GD2 CAR T cell trial for multiply relapsed patients with osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma. Given the potential anti-tumor efficacy of patrolling monocytes we plan to initiate an early phase clinical trial delivering nonclassical monocytes alone and in combination with CAR T cell therapy as part of this trial. There are 3 investigators in this project: one extramural, one intramural at NCI, and one at the NIH Clinical Center. From the results of this proposal, we will achieve significant insight into the roles of various myeloid cell subpopulations on promoting and inhibiting the anti-tumoral responses of CAR T cell therapies for solid tumors. We are uniquely poised as a research team to directly address the role of monocytes and other myeloid cells in interacting with CAR T cells in human patients. The findings of our research team will significantly advance the knowledge that will lead to effective CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors. As similar interactions of monocytes occur with T cells that are modulated by checkpoint inhibitor trials, we anticipate that our findings will shed insight into monocyte:T cell interactions in the context of checkpoint inhibition therapy.

LS SCLC has less than a 25% 5-year overall survival (OS) and ultimately a strategy for improving long-term SCLC outcomes needs to successfully target tumor cell populations that survive standard therapy and give rise to recurrent disease. There is, however, a considerable gap in understanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiotherapy resistance in SCLC. Our project is unique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on chemoradioresistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient- derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate mechanisms of therapy resistance. This approach was remarkably successful, identifying a tolerable and strongly synergistic anti- SCLC interaction that led to a CTEP-approved trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070; Study Chair: Hann). In this research program, we will test key hypotheses via three specific aims that will provide more mechanistic insights into the rapidly emergent chemoradiation resistance observed in LS SCLC. One central hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive gene expression changes mediate rapid emergence of the chemoradiation resistance phenotype in LS SCLC. We have developed a novel chemoradiation treatment regimen with SCLC PDX models to facilitate these studies. Development and characterization of this novel model involves a unique collaboration between medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, bioinformaticians, medical physicists, veterinarians and molecular/cell biologists that is extremely well suited to develop an integrated program dedicated to resolving questions of SCLC chemoradioresistance. Finally, we have already identified novel gene targets that are correlated with SCLC chemoradioresistance. Our research program is organized as follows: Aim #1: Characterize natural history of response of experimental models of SCLC to chemoradiation in vivo. We will determine response rates and recurrence patterns of a panel of SCLC PDXs and transgenic mouse models. Aim #2: Characterization of molecular underpinnings of SCLC chemoradiation resistance. We will reconstruct gene regulatory networks and gene expression profiles associated with chemoradiation resistance and develop small-scale predictive classifiers for therapy response to be validated in follow-up studies. Aim #3: Pharmacologic and genetic validation of candidate genes for SCLC chemoradiation resistance in vitro and in vivo. We will validate our novel gene candidates for conferring chemoradiation resistance using pharmacologic and genetic approach with SCLC PDX-derived organoids and SCLC transgenic mouse models.

One of the most successful therapies is chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR) that target the CD19 protein on the surface of leukemia. Landmark clinical trials led by our group demonstrated unparalleled efficacy in relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with complete remission rates in excess of 80%, resulting in the first ever FDA approval of a gene modified cell therapy (Kymriah, tisagenlecleucel). There is a great need to develop CAR therapies for other pediatric cancers, and we face many challenges to achieve the same level of success in solid tumors and lymphoma. Primary among these challenges is the difficulty in collecting healthy T cells from pediatric cancer patients. Our experience not only treating the most children in the world with CAR therapy but also getting the most referrals gave us insight into the difficulty of getting healthy T cells from children with cancer. We have identified two main problems: dysfunction in T cells from children with solid tumors present at diagnosis and progressive difficulty getting functional T cells after intensive chemotherapy. As we have investigated these problems, we learned how fortunate we were with pediatric ALL, a patient group that has proven to have T cells uniquely well preserved for CAR therapy generation. This project seeks to identify the mechanisms of dysfunction in T cells from pediatric cancer patients both before and after chemotherapy, and reverse them to enable the generation of highly active CAR T cell therapies for cancers other than ALL. Our preliminary data indicates that Naïve T cells are the key starting material for successful CAR T cell generation in pediatrics, and that in their absence preserving Naïve-like function during CAR manufacture can substitute. Metabolic pathways are key in the transitions from Naïve to memory and effector states, and these feed into the energy reserve of a T cell as measured by its mitochondrial potential. Our research plan centers on manipulating metabolic pathways and restoring mitochondrial respiratory capacity to T cells from pediatric cancer patients. This will enable the high level of proliferative capacity required for effective CAR therapy as we develop new targets within the Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery and Development Network. Our work will support the discovery efforts of the PI-DDN by developing the specialized T cell manufacturing required for these difficult to treat cancers.

These studies have broad relevance for pediatric leukemias given dependencies of numerous AML and ALL subtypes upon critical oncogenic cytokine receptor signaling pathways and the demonstrated clinical efficacy of cellular immunotherapies in children with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. In this proposal, we aim to develop combinatorial CAR approaches targeting (1) the TSLP receptor plus CD19 and/or CD22 to improve remission induction and longevity in Ph-like B-ALL, (2) the FLT3 receptor plus CD19 and/or CD22 to improve remission induction and longevity in KMT2A-rearranged B-ALL, and (3) the FLT3 receptor and CD33 to improve remission induction and longevity in FLT3-mutant AML. The overall goal of these studies is to identify successful combinatorial immunotherapeutic approaches to mitigate now-known resistance mechanisms of kinase signaling and antigen escape that are imminently translatable to the clinic for early-phase testing in children with high-risk acute leukemias.

project	1U01CA232488-01	U01CA232488	9616475	2018	Metabolic reprogramming of tumor microenvironment to maximize immunotherapy for pediatric cancers	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract Interactions of the immune system with tumors are complex and dynamic processes, which dictate tumor initia- tion, progression, and responses to therapy. Mounting evidence has shown that immunotherapies through strengthening the amplitude and quality of T cell-mediated adaptive response may mediate durable and even complete tumor regression in some cancer patients. Two of the most promising approaches to enhance thera- peutic anti-tumor immunity are immune checkpoint blockade using monoclonal antibodies against PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4, and adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) or peripheral T cells that are genetically engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). However, functional and effective effector T cells require metabolically rewiring T cells to meet their anabolic and energy demands. A critical barrier for immunotherapy is the hostile metabolic microenvironment within solid tumors, where the highly metabolic- demanding tumor cells compromise the function of T cells by competing for glucose. In addition, tumor cells also release immune suppressive metabolite, adenosine into the extracellular space. While recent advances have helped determine the metabolic reprogramming of T cell activation and its regulatory signaling mecha- nism, the detailed landscape of metabolic programs in active T cells and the impact of the tumor’s metabolic microenvironment on the development and anti-tumor immune function of cytotoxic T effector (Teff) cells re- mains elusive. Our studies have shown that glucose restriction significantly dampened the growth and tumor- killing activities of Teff cells. We further identified inosine as a potent metabolite that could replace glucose in promoting Teff cells growth and tumor-killing activities. Using inosine as the alterative metabolic substrate indi- cates a layer of metabolic plasticity on T cells and further implicates the potential of inosine in relieving tumor- imposed metabolic restrictions on T cells in vivo. However, stressed or damaged tumor cells release adeno- sine, an immediate metabolic precursor of inosine into the extracellular space to suppress Teff cells, shaping the efficacy and magnitude of anti-tumor immune response. Hence, we hypothesize that reprogramming of the adenosine-inosine metabolic axis can maximize anti-tumor immune response in treating pediatric solid tumors. To test our hypothesis, we propose to 1) decipher inosine catabolic pathways and to assess the impact of key metabolic steps on Teff cells; 2) develop and test inosine modulation strategies to enhance im- munotherapy; and 3) develop strategies to reprogram tumor metabolic microenvironment and maximize sys- temic anti-tumor immunity We propose taking the first step in testing the metabolic modulation of Teff cells to relieve the metabolic barriers imposed by the tumor’s microenvironment. Our studies will have profound effects on the field of cancer immunotherapy and substantially improve clinical outcomes of pediatric cancer patients. The insights generated from this study will reveal fundamental principles of the emerging connections between the tumor’s microenvironment, cell metabolism, and anti-tumor immunity.

The project detailed here commences with the selection and careful characterization of a dozen fully human antibodies to Glypican-2, the most promising antigen in neuroblastoma, from a pre-existing hybridoma stock. These antibodies, along with their full sequences, binding affinities, cellular internalization, epitope, and (where possible) crystal structures, will be made available to Consortium members within the first year for use in their modality of choice. This project will explore their utility as components in double bispecific antibody therapy: this double bispecific approach targets two cancer antigens and two T cell receptors simultaneously, inducing T cell activation and co-activation only in the presence of cancer cells expressing both antigens. The double targeting strategy should allow for a much higher level of selective engagement and killing than has heretofore been possible with therapies that target only a single cancer antigen, and should it prove effective in neuroblastoma the approach is likely to have utility in a wide variety of cancers. One historical weakness for the development of immuno-oncology approaches such as this one is that the animal models have had very little predictive value. For this reason, the best of the humanized mouse models, “MISTRG” mice, will be used both for the development of these molecules and for testing the other consortium members’ approaches, where they could be useful. CIVO multi- needle array technology will be employed to simplify the combinatorial challenge associated with testing pairs of bispecific molecules; this technology will also be open for use collaboratively with the other Consortium members. In short, the proposal provides the Consortium with human antibodies against a validated neuroblastoma target, access to the current state-of-the-art in humanized mice, a CIVO multi-needle array device to facilitate testing therapeutics, and a double bispecific antibody therapeutic approach that promises a high level of T cell killing and selectivity and a likely broad applicability beyond neuroblastoma.

project	1U01CA232491-01	U01CA232491	9616585	2018	Dual targeting of tumoral microenvironment and tumoral cells by blocking the IL-33/ST2 pathway	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: A fundamental gap exists in our knowledge of the immunologic tumoral microenvironment during the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other deadly childhood cancers. Bridging of this gap could lead to novel immunotherapies. Our long-term goals are to develop novel immunotherapies for leukemia and pediatric solid tumors. Our objective in this application is to investigate the role of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing Stimulation-2 (ST2), the IL-33 receptor in the microenvironment as well as ST2 on tumoral cells. Our central hypothesis is that we can target the tumoral microenvironment and tumoral cells by blocking the IL-33/ST2 pathway with neutralizing and bispecific antibodies that we will develop. This hypothesis was formed based on our unpublished preliminary data showing that: First, nonmalignant mice deficient in T-bet have elevated numbers of BM-infiltrating ST2+ Tregs compared to wild-type (WT) mice (45% vs 25%, respectively), suggesting reciprocal roles of ST2/IL33 and T- bet/interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in Tregs from the BM niche. Second, we observed 10-fold more Tregs expressing significantly more activation markers in the BM niche of AML-bearing mice than in the nonmalignant niche. Third, MLL-AF9 AML cell proliferation was significantly lower in mice receiving donor syngeneic ST2 knock-out (ST2-/-) T cells than in mice receiving donor syngeneic WT T cells (2% vs 17%, respectively). ST2 blockade also decreased Treg activation (i.e., KLRG1) and increased type 1 signaling in CD8+ T cells as well as decreased their exhaustion, suggesting restoration of an antitumoral response in ST2-/- mice. The rationale for this study is that once we are able to understand the biology of the immunological microenvironment in the malignant niche, we can propose personalized treatment plans to block the tolerogenic pathways. Similarly, understanding the biology responsible for the overexpression of ST2/IL-33 on the tumoral cell, will help target this pathway. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Explore ST2 and IL-33 expression on tumoral cells and in the tumoral microenvironment from liquid and solid childhood cancers in human and mice; 2) Examine whether ST2/IL-33 blockade can impact tumor immunity in the malignant BM niche and solid tumor microenvironment as a proof-of-principle of a novel antitumoral immunotherapy; and 3) Optimizing anti-ST2 neutralizing antibodies against murine and human targets for translational purpose. This approach is innovative because, to our knowledge, the function of ST2+ Tregs in the malignant microenvironment, remains virtually unexplored. It will also provide biological insights into the nature of ST2+ Tregs and ST2+ tumoral cells in the microenvironment and determine whether their blockade can restore antitumoral activity and decrease tumoral proliferation via a dual mechanism. The proposed research is significant because novel antitumoral immunotherapies that are more targeted and less toxic than classical chemotherapy/irradiation regimens are needed.

project	1U01CA232563-01	U01CA232563	9617084	2018	Cassette exons in neoplastic pro-B-cells: implications for immunotherapy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Successful immunotherapies for childhood cancers typically target lineage-, rather than cancer-specific markers, B-cell specific CD19 being the prime example. These successes culminated in the recent FDA approval of bi-specific T-cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-armed T-cells for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, relapses frequently occur in patients treated with CD19- directed immunotherapies, often due to epitope loss. While strategies based on dual antigen targeting are beginning to emerge, they are still based on targeting canonical B-cell markers, with the unavoidable side effect of total ablation of normal B-cells. The apparent paucity of tumor-specific targets in pediatric cancers (including leukemias) is likely to limit future immunotherapies. We hypothesize that alternative splicing could be both a mechanism of epitope loss and a rich source of a neo-antigens in B-ALL. Indeed, using computational and biochemical approaches, we have identified hundreds of local splicing variations (LSVs), mapping to transmembrane proteins (e.g., CD19 and CD22) with prominent extracellular domains (ectodomains). In fact, in our prior work we described a mechanism of acquired resistance to CART-19 based on selective loss of the CD19 ectodomain, primarily through exon 2 skipping. The two large Aims of this U01 are as follows. Aim 1: To identify programs and determinants of altered splicing of B-ALL cell surface antigens. Our overarching goal is to construct a dedicated “splicing code” for leukemic B-cells. Such a code will predict cis-acting genetic variants as well as trans-acting factors involved in alternative splicing and allow us to identify all alternatively spliced ectodomains. Then in Aim 2, we will investigate the effects of alternative splicing on B-ALL immunotherapy. Using CD22 as just one example, we will determine how truncated protein isoforms confer resistance to CD22-targeting immunotherapeutics, including antibody- drug conjugates such as inotuzumab ozogamicin, which was recently approved by FDA to treat relapsed or refractory B-ALL. We will also raise antibodies against peptides spanning novel exon junctions, generate antibody-drug conjugates, and test their efficacy against B-ALL cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In summary, this leukemia-based U01 will create new computational and conceptual frameworks, which would be highly synergistic with Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery & Development Network (PI-DDN) overall goals, including identification of antigenic epitopes that are uniquely expressed on childhood cancers and of cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion.

project	1U01CA232758-01	U01CA232758	9618288	2018	B cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity in ovarian cancer	Grant	ABSTRACT  Within tumor beds, T and B cells often interact to form highly organized structures similar to lymph nodes, termed tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), which are associated with better outcomes in many tumors. TFH cells are crucial for the formation of germinal centers and humoral responses, and our new data show that TFH cells become the main producers of CXCL13 and TNFS14/LIGHT upon vaccination. The assembly and maintenance of TLS should be therefore dependent on TFH responses. Our new data demonstrate that Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (Satb1) ablation specifically in T cells leads to enhanced TFH differentiation and augmented Ag-specific humoral responses, which is associated with concurrent ICOS and PD-1 de-repression. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that LIGHT+CXCL13+ TFH cell formation and, subsequently, the orchestration of TLS in cancer, is governed by Satb1 silencing in CD4 T cells by both de-repressing ICOS in TFH cells and suppressing Foxp3+PD-1highCXCR5+ T follicular regulatory (TFR) cell formation through PD-1 up-regulation. Therefore, TGF-β paradoxically enhances the generation of TFH cells and the formation of TLS through Satb1 repression.  In Aim 1, we will define the role of SATB1-dependent ICOS expression during TFH differentiation. Through ChIP-PCR and functional analysis of Satb1-competent vs. Satb1- deficient T cells in vivo, we will substantiate a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby the master genomic organizer Satb1 governs ICOS expression, leading to enhanced TFH differentiation in the absence of Satb1.  In Aim 2, we will determine the role of SATB1 in TGF-β-driven, Treg-dependent TFH differentiation. Here, we will combine geentic manipulation and existing transgenic models to establish to what extent the mechanism of TGF-β-driven TFH differentiation is Satb1- and PD-1- dependent, in a manner that requires decreased TFR formation.  In Aim 3, we will recapitulate the mechanisms leading to the formation and protective activity of TLS in vivo in ovarian cancer. By leveraging unique transgenic models, our ovarian cancer- specific CAR T cells and our viable single-cell suspensions from freshly dissociated ovarian carcinomas, we will define a novel TGF-β → Satb1 silencing → TFH cell formation axis driving relevant anti-tumor humoral responses.  Our work will exert a profound effect in the field by elucidating how epigenetic programs controlled by SATB1 govern the generation of TFH cells at tumor beds in a TGF-β-dependent manner. Recapitulating these mechanisms in vivo will pave the way for more effective immunotherapies aimed to promote combined humoral and T cell responses through the orchestration of TLS in irresectable/metastatic tumors, and could lead to the identification of antibodies with anti-tumor activity spontaneously produced at tumor beds.

Current practice guidelines from ACMG provide referral indications for cancer predisposition assessment. Identifying patients with high genetic risk for breast, ovary, colon, or other cancers has important clinical ramifications for an individual's healthcare, but genetic risk if often not identified because of testing barriers at several levels. Barriers at the provider level include inadequacies in risk recognition, patient referrals and availability of genetic professionals to provide counseling in a traditional testing paradigm. Barriers at the level of the patient include poor understanding of the availability and benefits of testing and inadequate access to testing services. How to best implement appropriate genomic testing and follow-up care into an operating healthcare system is not known. Issues of communication, clinical flow, reportable actions, and transmission of information and support are of critical importance, and must change and grow to accommodate the new information contained within genomic testing. Studies to date of the implementation process have been conducted in high resourced facilities, under optimal conditions, often not at the system level. Aims include: 1. Compare the efficacy and implementation of two strategies for identifying members of a primary care clinic's population who have a family or personal history of cancer and offering high-risk individuals to obtain genetic testing for cancer susceptibility mutations in a randomized trial. The two methods are: 1) Point of Care (POC) approach: A tablet-based screening for family/personal history of cancer will be offered to all patients aged 25- 65 coming in for a routine appointment at the clinic. 2) Direct Patient Engagement (DPE): Letters will be sent to all individuals aged 25-65 in a clinic's population, inviting them to visit a web site for screening for family /personal history of cancer. In both strategies, those determined to be high-risk will receive online education about genetic testing and an invitation to obtain such testing through a web-based platform. Outcomes will be the fraction of the active clinic patient population that completes screening and the fraction of the active clinic patient population that undergoes testing. 2. Identify changes, problems, and inefficiencies in clinical flow and interactions during and after the implementation of genomic testing for cancer risk across primary care clinics. 3. Evaluate the effects of two methods of implementation of genomic screening for cancer risk on patient, provider, and health system leader reports of benefits and harms, satisfaction, perceived quality of care, including across gender, racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and genetic literacy divides. 4. Evaluate the value (cost-effectiveness) and affordability (budget impact) of each screening strategy.

The paradigm was developed based on the principle that genetic testing was expensive and that the incidence of these syndromes was low. Over the past twenty years the price of testing has fallen dramatically and it is now recognized that both HBOC and Lynch syndrome are relatively common (joint incidence of about 1 in 200). Many individuals in the population are affected by HBOC or Lynch but come from small families with few female relatives. Given the decreases in family size that have occurred over the past 50 years this is becoming a common situation. It is estimated that only 20% of those affected by HBOC are aware of their condition. Overall, there is a significant unmet need for those with HBOC and Lynch syndrome to be identified so they can have the opportunity for appropriate medical care. What we need are approaches that can rapidly, accurately, and inexpensively identify those with inherited cancer syndromes. The costs of sequencing have fallen dramatically and members of our team have QIAseq based targeted resequencing platforms for germline studies that dramatically lower the cost of panel based sequencing while allowing easy, rapid multiplexing. The costs of testing will be near $90 per sample. We have taken the task of developing a strategy that can be applied to detect HBOC and Lynch syndromes in broader populations. We will study the effectiveness of population scale testing of these two syndromes by enrolling 27,500 individuals, who are (a) eligible for inherited cancer syndrome testing (2,500) (b) have had cancer but are not covered by current screening guidelines to receive a low cost genetic screen (7,500) or (c) healthy (17,500). Those individuals identified to have Lynch or HBOC will be followed for outcomes and compared to a matched cohort identified following standard screening guidelines. Additionally, relatives of those identified will be enrolled in cascade screening. We will determine if testing either cancer patients or the general population represents a sustainable strategy for population screening based on QALY measurements.

Strategies to assess the genetic risk of unaffected individuals are needed. Scalable and sustainable methods to automatically extract and analyze family history information routinely captured in the electronic health record (EHR) can identify primary care patients appropriate for cancer genetic services. Increased patient ascertainment needs to be paired with implementation studies to compare models of delivering genetic services, including patient-directed models. Because access to services continues to be a barrier for those from minority racial and ethnic groups and rural areas, examining responses to different delivery models across population subgroups is essential. This study will employ an implementation science framework to test a replicable EHR-based clinical decision support (CDS) infrastructure to: (i) automatically identify unaffected patients from 48 primary care clinics in two healthcare systems, University of Utah and New York University, who qualify for cancer genetic services (Aim 1); and (ii) compare two models of genetic services delivery for 1,920 primary care patients using a randomized trial design with clinic-level randomization (Aims 2 and 3). We hypothesize that the CDS infrastructure will identify additional patients who have not been previously referred (Aim 1) and that uptake of genetic testing (Aim 2) and adherence to management recommendations (Aim 3) will be equivalent between the models. To address Aim 1, we will evaluate whether the CDS approach identifies patients who have not previously been referred, and whether this varies by race/ethnicity and rurality. To address Aim 2, we will compare: a patient-directed model in which those identified by the CDS infrastructure as meeting testing criteria will be informed of their cancer risks, provided with educational resources, and offered the option to select genetic testing through a patient portal to an enhanced standard of care model in which providers and patients are notified through CDS when criteria are met and of the availability of standard of care genetic counseling. We will compare uptake of genetic testing by model and whether this differs by race/ethnicity and rurality. In Aim 3, we will compare the effects of the two delivery models on adherence to recommendations 12 months after return of results, examining differences in effects by race/ethnicity and rurality. Innovative features include implementation of population-based CDS assessment of family history information available in the EHR; comparison of outcomes of patient-directed and enhanced standard of care delivery models; and focus on impact of race/ethnicity and rurality. This highly impactful translational research builds on our unique strengths in cancer genetics, clinical informatics, and population sciences, and addresses issues of immediate clinical significance, including increasing hereditary cancer genetic testing in appropriate patients and improving access for underserved groups.

Barriers to testing, at both the patient and provider levels, include gaps in knowledge and poor access to specialty genetics services. This multiphase project seeks to employ practice-level and patient-level interventions to increase the proportion of patients in whom family history is documented and assessed for genetic risk and in whom guideline-concordant genetic evaluation is completed. This proposal leverages existing partnerships between a statewide oncology network, public health agencies, payers, and a multidisciplinary team at the University of Michigan to encourage systematic family history ascertainment and genetic risk assessment among newly-diagnosed cancer patients cared for in 68 medical and gyn-oncology practices. In partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and a network of nearly all oncology practices in Michigan, the Michigan Oncology Quality Consortium, we will deploy interventions to promote collection and assessment of family history and genetic evaluations for eligible patients with breast, colorectal, ovarian, prostate and endometrial cancer cared for in diverse clinical and geographic settings across the state. The first Specific Aim is to test the impact of innovative practice-based interventions on the proportion of patients who have a comprehensive family history documented in their medical record. In the first phase, using a stepped-wedge design, we will provide a tablet-based family health history survey tool to practices and evaluate the impact of the tool on quality measures of family history documentation and guideline concordant genetic referrals. In the second phase, at Year 4, we will test the impact of adding value-based reimbursement using family history ascertainment as the quality improvement metric. The second Specific Aim is to evaluate the impact of two behavioral interventions (tailored messaging via mobile optimized web interface vs genetic counseling using motivational interviewing) on uptake of genetic testing among patients with cancer who meet clinical criteria and disclosure of genetic test results to at-risk relatives. Our third Specific Aim addresses longitudinal follow up of cancer patients, exploring uptake of cascade genetic testing in families with germline mutations. These projects directly address implementation and dissemination of genomic medicine in diverse settings and will leverage both new and well-established partnerships among community and academic oncology practices, public health agencies, and payers in the state of Michigan. The University of Michigan is a leader in genomic medicine, behavioral interventions with diverse populations, healthcare policy, and implementation science, and the proposed work engages multidisciplinary expertise in caring for a diverse patient population and developing sustainable and scalable approaches for precision oncology in diverse healthcare settings.

Innovations in bioinformatic technology hold great promise in overcoming many of these barriers, particularly with the development of FHH applications that collect and analyze family data, and SMART-on-FHIR capabilities that can integrate third party apps with the EMR. MeTree, a patient facing risk assessment platform for 23 hereditary cancer syndromes with integrated education and evidence- based clinical decision support, is one such platform that served as the backbone of the Implementing Genomics in Practice (IGNITE) network's FHH clinical utility study, where it demonstrated improvements in the identification of those at risk, yet, also highlighted ongoing challenges particularly around undergoing genetic counseling and testing, and awareness of risk. We submit that these barriers can be overcome and that we can significantly improve identification and management of those at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes by bringing together a single clinical care platform that contains: a patient-facing risk assessment program integrated into the EMR, automated risk calculation with clinical decision support for patients and physicians for multiple hereditary cancer syndromes, systematic assessment of risk across a variety of clinic settings, guidance and education on family health history, genomics, risk management, and cascade screening, and an implementation sciences framework to allow us to build a novel and scalable clinical care paradigm for hereditary cancer risk assessment and risk management. To do this we will: 1) deploy a care delivery model that will facilitate systematic risk assessment for hereditary cancers in diverse clinical environments (in primary care and cancer care clinics at two different medical centers) in a randomized controlled trial of 4000 patients; 2) improve access to genetic healthcare providers for participants at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes by deploying the care delivery model in the cancer genetic counseling clinics in a randomized controlled trial of 300 patients; and 3) explore the feasibility of our care delivery model to improve family engagement for cancer risk assessment for patients who are found to have cancer gene variants or strong family histories of cancer.

project	1U01CA232836-01A1	U01CA232836	9848961	2019	Randomized trial of universal vs. guideline-directed germline testing among young adults with cancer	Grant	Cancer is the leading nontraumatic cause of death among young adults. In individuals under age 40, cancer has a distinct biology and often has an underlying genetic etiology. However, consensus guidelines driven by phenotypic characteristics fail to identify many young adult patients with inherited genetic risk, in part due to their complexity and to lack of data on mutation frequency. We likely vastly underestimate the frequency and spectrum of germline susceptibility in young adults with cancer, knowledge of which would have far-reaching implications both for their treatment and follow-up care and for the diagnosis and management of relatives. Thus, better strategies for diagnosing inherited risk among young adults with cancer are needed. Further, genetic testing rates among relatives of those identified with inherited cancer risk range from 50-60%; interventions to overcome the barriers that patients and relatives face, so they can take appropriate screening and risk-reducing measures, must be developed and tested. Finally, there is a critical need to integrate genetic evaluation and test results into the electronic medical record (EMR) to facilitate tailored clinical decision support for both clinicians and patients. The present proposal seeks to overcome the limitations of current data and models of care through two Specific Aims. First, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial among 1421 young adults with cancer, one-third of whom will be members of racial or ethnic minorities or medically underserved groups, to compare rates of ascertainment of genetic risk between guideline-driven, phenotype- directed genetic testing (current standard of care) and universal cancer panel genetic testing. Working with the Penn Medicine Nudge Unit and Information Services, we will develop EMR-based algorithms for automatic patient referral and clinical decision support, driven by discrete genetic test results ported into the EMR via HL7, that will include ‘active choice’ nudges, direct-to-patient alerts, and physician dashboards that minimize physician burden. We will compare adherence to screening recommendations among participants to that among historical controls. Second, we will compare the impact of the two up-front testing strategies among patients, enhanced by a novel strategy of direct team outreach to at-risk relatives, on ascertainment of genetic risk among family members. We also will conduct qualitative interviews with a diverse sample of patients, relatives, and family groups to describe the critical interactions that facilitate or impede communication about risk and cascade testing within families and to explore the acceptability of direct clinical team outreach to at- risk relatives. The proposed study promises to immediately alter national standards of care and payer policies by identifying the preferred approach to evaluating young adult cancer patients for genetic risk through a rigorous randomized trial, while measuring ascertainment among both patients and their relatives. In addition, beyond its potential to change standards of care, the study will generate shareable EMR-based code, algorithms, and models that will further enhance the sustainability of the proposed approach.

Symptom side effects such as nausea and diarrhea are particularly common and impactful on the patient experience. However, historically this information has been reported by clinicians on behalf of their patients rather than by patients themselves – a process that has been shown to miss up to half of patients' symptoms. Therefore, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) supported development of the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), a library of questions to enable systematic patient self-reporting of side effect information. To date, the PRO-CTCAE questions have been developed and tested for validity and feasibility of use in clinical trials – work that was led by the investigators on this proposal under contracts to the NCI. However, it is not yet established how best to combine PRO-CTCAE information with traditional measures of treatment impact such as clinician-reported adverse events, time on treatment, drug dose levels, performance status, and hospitalizations. The purpose of this proposal is to advance understanding of the role of the PRO- CTCAE in combination with these traditional measures of treatment impact in assessments of drug tolerability. In this proposal, advanced statistical methods will be used to analyze data from numerous clinical trials accessible to the team through the National Clinical Trial Network (cooperative groups) and industry. The specific aims are to: 1) characterize relationships between the PRO-CTCAE and traditional measures of treatment impact and tolerability; 2) test and standardize analytic techniques for the PRO-CTCAE; 3) refine approaches to analyzing missing PRO-CTCAE data; and 4) develop and refine tabular and graphical data visualizations for longitudinal PRO-CTCAE data. To accomplish these aims, an exceptional multidisciplinary team has been assembled including scientific, clinical, and patient investigators with extensive experience in academic and industry clinical research, and longstanding expertise in patient-reported outcomes, adverse events, biostatistics, psychometrics, clinical trial design/analysis, health disparities, and informatics. This team has successfully led multiple prior national research consortia. The team will work collaboratively and flexibly with other investigators and stakeholders through the planned U01 consortium, and will share data, statistical programming code, and ideas freely. This work is intended to inform best practices for tabulating and reporting PRO-CTCAE data, and will enable more systematic and patient-centered evaluations of tolerability in cancer clinical trials.

Germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, primarily MLH1 and MSH2, cause deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) and LS. LS CRCs have exceptionally high numbers of small insertion/deletion frameshift and missense mutations. Elevated dMMR mutation rates cause some mutations to recurrently arise in tumors from different patients. For example, the human TGFβR2 gene has a poly(A) coding repeat, and the same “shared” frameshift mutation is recurrently identified in >60% of LS dMMR CRCs. Here, we will use state of the art tools to systematically delineate recurrent LS mouse and human pre-malignant neoantigens, test whether vaccination with frequently mutated “shared” immunogenic neoantigens reduces LS mouse CRC penetrance, and elucidate adaptive immune mechanisms for CRC immunoprevention. In Aim 1 we will comprehensively delineate frequently mutated recurrent neoantigens in Lynch syndrome mouse colorectal mucosa and adenomas. This will provide insights into pre-malignant colon dMMR immunoediting mechanisms, the timing and sequence of dMMR neoantigen appearance, and systematically delineate the most immunogenic recurrent shared dMMR neoantigen vaccine targets for LS mouse CRC immunoprevention. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome mismatch repair deficient epithelial cells in colon mucosa. This will give insights into the mechanism of dMMR colon mucosal immunoediting, and test the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent neoantigen vaccine strategy using the earliest neoantigen mutations for LS immunoprevention. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome colorectal tumor burden. This will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent adenoma neoantigen vaccine strategy for Lynch syndrome immunoprevention and provide insights into the mechanisms of dMMR immunoediting. Finally, in Aim 4 we will systematically delineate Lynch syndrome patient adenoma recurrent neoantigens. This will delineate the most promising candidate recurrent neoantigens that can be used for LS patient tumor vaccine clinical trials and give insights into dMMR immunoediting mechanisms. Our overall goal is to develop effective, safe mechanism based neoantigen vaccination strategies for Lynch syndrome CRC immunoprevention.

project	1U01CA233074-01	U01CA233074	9626083	2018	Targeting alternative splicing for TCR discovery in small cell carcinomas	Grant	ABSTRACT  We present a collaborative immunotherapeutics discovery program that exploits alternative pre-mRNA splicing as a source of cancer-specific epitopes for T-cell receptor (TCR) therapy of small cell carcinomas of the prostate and lung. Small cell carcinomas arise from many different epithelial tissues but are generally aggressive, have no curative treatment, and carry a dire prognosis. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most common subtype. Small cell prostate cancer (SCPC) is rare as a primary disease but is becoming increasingly common as a late-stage phenotypic transition in response to hormone-deprivation therapy. Emerging research indicates that despite their disparate tissues of origin, SCPC and SCLC are highly similar in behavior and molecular phenotype. This suggests effective targeted therapies could address both malignancies.  Our strategy is to define cancer-specific epitopes created by alternative pre-mRNA splicing in small cell carcinomas and then use these targets to develop TCR-based therapeutics. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies targeting cell surface proteins have been developed for some hematological malignancies, but this strategy has been unsuccessful for epithelial tumors. The limited cancer specificity of the target epitope has led to significant on-target, off-tumor toxicities in human trials. We have chosen to pursue TCRs to expand the pool of available targets beyond the cell surface. We hypothesize that tapping into the additional proteomic diversity revealed by a detailed analysis of alternatively spliced exons will provide better targets.  Our team of principal investigators includes experts in the computational biology of alternative splicing (Yi Xing), cancer cell biology and immunology (Owen Witte), and hematopoietic cell development and immunology (Gay Crooks). We are compiling RNA-Seq data on small cell cancers and normal tissues from public datasets and new human cell line models of SCPC & SCLC derived from benign cells by lentiviral transduction. This combined dataset serves as the foundation for our discovery effort. We plan to pair this with total proteomics analysis to identify spliced isoforms that affect protein composition. This data will be further integrated with immunopeptidomics assays that define the pool of peptides presented to the immune system by the target cancer cells. Epitopes derived from alternative splicing events that show high cancer specificity, protein expression, and predicted or observed epitope presentation will be prioritized for TCR development. We will use these epitopes to select TCRs from naïve human T-cell populations using a highly organotypic in vitro artificial human thymic culture system developed in the Crooks laboratory.

project	1U01CA233078-01	U01CA233078	9626046	2018	N-glycosylation and Immunotherapy for cancer	Grant	Project Summary For decades, the treatment of cancer has relied on surgical resection, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Recently, a number of immune based therapies have provided promising new approaches for cancer treatment. These include checkpoint inhibitors that block T cell suppression (eg anti-PD-1), bi-specific antibodies that cross-link T cells to cancer cells (eg Bi-specific T cell engagers – BiTE) and T cells engineered to express antigen receptors specific to cancer cells (eg Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells or CAR T). All three approaches induce T cell mediated killing of cancer cells. However, widespread development of bi-specific antibodies and CAR T cells is limited by the small number of known cell-surface proteins that are sufficiently specific to cancer to safely allow targeting by antibodies. This is particularly true for solid cancers, where unlike hematopoietic malignancies, loss of healthy cells cannot be readily replenished by stem cell progenitors. A solution to this issue is to target cancer specific glycan antigens rather than protein antigens. Indeed, altered glycosylation is a near universal feature of cancer and represent the most abundant and widely expressed cell surface cancer antigens, while also having limited or no expression in normal tissue. However, generation of monoclonal antibodies specific to complex carbohydrates has proven to be very challenging, greatly limiting their usefulness as targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we propose to address these issues and develop a novel class of immunotherapeutics that target an N-linked carbohydrate antigen common to the vast majority of solid and hematopoietic cancers. We have termed these molecules as Glycan- dependent T cell Recruiter (GlyTR) technology. Critically, GlyTR technology does not utilize antibodies to target carbohydrate cancer antigens. Preliminary data demonstrates that the GlyTR bi-specific protein 1) specifically bound to both human CD3 and its N-glycan target, 2) robustly activated T cells only in the presence of cancer cells, 3) induced T cell dependent killing of cancer cells with an EC50 as low as 5pM, 4) inhibited in vivo growth of established colon cancer xenografts in humanized NSG mice and 5) did not trigger production of antibodies in mice. To further expand on this approach, the following Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will characterize human and mouse reactive GlyTR bi-specific proteins targeting N-glycans. Aim 2 will examine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using humanized NSG mice. Aim 3 will examine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using mice with a normal immune system. If successful, these experiments will provide proof of principal data for an entire new class of cancer killing immunotherapeutic's capable of targeting multiple solid and hematopoietic cancers with minimal toxicity.

However, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been limited by low response rates and limited durations of response in certain settings, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), as well as ovarian, prostate and colorectal cancers. These findings are explained, at least in part, by the premise that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is only one of a number of tumor immune suppressive mechanisms that require inhibition.  Therefore, additional strategies are clearly needed to improve the immunotherapy of human cancers. In this respect, cancer cells activate a program of immune evasion involving, for example, induction of PD-L1 expression and the downregulation of effectors that promote innate and adaptive immune response. The discovery and targeting of such immune suppressive programs has had limited success to date, supporting a critical need for identifying signaling pathways that activate these programs.  The MUC1-C oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in human carcinomas and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. MUC1-C promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the cancer stem cell (CSC) state. Recent advances have demonstrated that MUC1-C also activates a program of immune evasion in human cancer cells that includes upregulation of PD-L1 expression and the suppression of immune effectors, such as IFN. In addition, targeting MUC1-C has been found to effectively reverse tumor immune evasion.  These findings have emphasized the need for developing agents that target MUC1-C for the immunotherapy of human cancers. In this way, selective and potent antibodies generated against the MUC1-C extracellular domain are under development as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and for antibody- dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, a peptide inhibitor of the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain has been developed in a nanoparticle formulation, based on the findings that this agent inhibits PD-L1 expression and activates anti-tumor T cells in the immune microenvironment.  The MUC1-C-targeted agents will be studied in genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for anti-tumor activity, as well as effects on the immune microenvironment when used alone and in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade. These studies will be integrated with assessment of MUC1-C expression in human tumors as a metric of the suppressive immune microenvironment. The overall goal will be to develop agents that target MUC1-C and are advanced to clinical evaluation as novel immunotherapeutics.

project	1U01CA233085-01A1	U01CA233085	9869478	2019	Reprograming the tumor microenvironment to overcome multiple primary and acquired immune resistance mechanisms in ovarian cancer	Grant	The goal of our studies is to generate robust and long-lasting tumor-specific T cell responses for durable tumor regression in patients with chemotherapy-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Although immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive T cell therapy, or oncolytic viruses has generated remarkable results in several other tumor types, long-term tumor control has been infrequent in EOC patients. Studies by our group have identified key stumbling blocks underpinning the limited efficacy of immunotherapy in EOC, which include: (i) insufficient expansion of tumor-specific T cells, (ii) tumor-derived CXCL12 production that recruits Tregs and MDSC within tumors, (iii) expression of PD1 and LAG3 marking severely dysfunctional tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), (iv) compensatory upregulation of LAG3 upon blockade of PD1 and vice-versa, and (v) disorganized and tortuous tumor vasculature lacking adequate flow dynamics to support trafficking of anti-tumor T cells. While combinatorial immunotherapy strategies have the potential to overcome these immune resistance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME), they are often associated with unacceptably high rates of toxicities in patients. Our proposal addresses these stumbling blocks using innovative, clinically-translatable strategies to reprogram the TME and to identify mechanisms that drive or hinder T cell trafficking into ovarian tumors.  We previously demonstrated blockade of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in the ovarian TME by intraperitoneal delivery of an oncolytic vaccinia virus expressing a CXCR4 antagonist (OV-CXCR4-Fc) reduced intratumoral accumulation of immunosuppressive mediators and stimulated spontaneous antitumor immunity to endogenous tumor antigens. OV-CXCR4-Fc also improved T cell trafficking. We will build on the multifaceted antitumor activity of OV-CXCR4-Fc by further “arming” with antagonists of PD1 and LAG3, the two co-inhibitory receptors we have shown mark severely dysfunctional TILs in EOC patients. In addition, we plan to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which OV-CXCR4-Fc enhances T cell migration and trafficking to overcome the ovarian tumor “vascular checkpoint”. We hypothesize that in vivo tumor destruction by OV engineered to express the CXCR4 antagonist and PD1/LAG3 inhibitors (OV-CXCR4-Fc-PD1/LAG3) will limit dampening of the immune response in the TME and induce a molecular signature that promotes trafficking and homing of tumor-specific T cells. To test our hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1. Determine the therapeutic synergy of arming OV-CXCR4-Fc with PD1/LAG3 inhibitors.  Aim 2. Determine the mechanism by which OV-CXCR4-Fc promotes T cell trafficking in murine and human  ovarian tumors.  Aim 3. To manufacture and certify a Master Viral Bank (MVB) and Final Product (FP) of OV-CXCR4-Fc for  IND qualification.

project	1U01CA233096-01A1	U01CA233096	9868724	2019	Cytokine immunotherapies for melanoma	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Immunotherapies for cancer, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), have exhibited impressive efficacy for a broad spectrum of cancers, including melanoma. However, despite their potential to produce dramatic treatment responses, ICI have proven to be ineffective for most patients and tumor types. Consequently, there remains a need for new immunotherapies that are effective in patients who are resistant or non-responsive to current ICI. To this end, immune cytokines have potent immunostimulatory activities that make them attractive potential therapeutics. Compared to the effect of ICI to “tune” existing immune responses, cytokines can tap into powerful programs that can effectively “reprogram” immune cells and control their activation, differentiation, and proliferation. Among cytokines, Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is an appealing immunotherapeutic candidate given its ability to stimulate both adaptive and innate immunity through CD8+ T and NK cells, respectively. However, the activity of IL-18 is limited by an endogenous decoy receptor, IL-18BP, which is induced as part of a negative feedback loop by interferon gamma activity, reminiscient of the regulation of the PD-1:PD-L1 axis and suggesting that it may represent a “soluble immune checkpoint” in cancer. Using directed evolution, the Ring lab has created an engineered version of IL-18 that is fully capable of activating the IL-18 receptor, but impervious to inhibition by IL-18BP. This decoy resistant IL-18 (DR-18) is active as a mono-immunotherapy in preclinical mouse models, where it can induce complete and durable tumor regressions. DR-18 also synergizes with ICI (anti-PD-1) therapy and is associated with high cure rates and limited toxicity in this setting. Notably, DR-18 is also effective for the treatment of MHC class I deficient murine tumors, which are resistant to ICI treatment, consistent with the ability of IL-18 to also activate anti-tumor activity of NK cells. In order to better understand the mechanism of DR-18 immunotherapy and enable its translation into the clinic, we propose to leverage a comprehensive series of sophisticated, genetically-defined syngeneic mouse models of melanoma called YUMM and YUMMER that we have developed. We propose to more comprehensively evaluate our hypothesis that bypass of the IL-18BP checkpoint by DR-18 will enable responses in ICI-resistant tumors in two Aims: 1) Evaluation and optimization of DR-18 therapy in melanoma, and 2) Development of DR-18 for the treatment of ICI-resistant tumors. We will utilize techniques including single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitiative pathology to better characterize DR-18 responses in the tumor microenvironment over time. Results from murine experiments will be functionally validated in fresh, dissociated human melanoma specimens. We aim to begin clinical trials with human DR-18 in 2020; these aims are focused on understanding and optimizing DR-18 in anticipation of this work.

However, the therapeutic potential of the immune system in eliminating premalignant cells and preventing their progression to invasive cancers is unclear. To determine the benefit of activating the immune system to prevent cancer development and recurrence, we study the immune pathways that lead to effective immune activation against early phases of breast cancer development. Breast cancer is the most common internal cancer and second cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Importantly, the individuals at high risk of developing breast cancer due to underlying genetic mutations and those with premalignant lesions can be clinically identified and treated. Therefore, discovering an effective approach to activate the patients' own immune system against early breast precursor lesions may yield a lasting memory that can prevent breast cancer development and recurrence in this high-risk population. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a skin-derived immune factor called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) suppresses the early stages of skin and breast cancer development. We have been able to extend these finding to clinics through a randomized double-blind clinical trial in which we find TSLP induction to promote a robust immune activation against skin cancer precursors and their complete clearance. In order to determine the precise mechanism of TSLP-induced immune response against early premalignant cells in the breast, and to extend our findings to other similar immune factors in high-risk patients, we aim to (1) determine the immune cells and signals that target breast premalignant cells in response to TSLP, (2) investigate the role of other immune factors released by breast cells that can induce immune response to block breast cancer development, and (3) determine the factors that are driving the immune response in the breast glands of patients with genetic mutations and utilize them for induction of an optimal immune response against early breast cancer. The outcomes of the proposed research will establish a foundation for the use of the immune system in blocking breast cancer development and provide novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer immunoprevention.

Advances in immunotherapy with drugs targeting immune checkpoints have raised hopes that these agents will improve outcomes for mCRPC patients. While initial studies of immune checkpoint blockade have been unsuccessful, emerging evidence suggests a subset of prostate cancer (PCa) patients can respond, although the mechanisms of PCa immunotherapy response and resistance are incompletely characterized. Work in other immunotherapy responsive malignancies has found several predictive immune and tumor-intrinsic properties that contribute to response, but the extent to which these (or other) features are operant in PCa is largely unknown. For example, we recently identified mutations in a chromatin remodeling complex that mediates immunotherapy response through T cell interactions in solid tumors, and in parallel discovered a previously unknown PCa genomic subclass defined by mutations in these same chromatin remodelers. These findings indicate that tumor-intrinsic epigenetic dysregulation may also interact with the immune system to modulate PCa immunotherapy responsiveness. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that multiple immune and tumor- intrinsic properties mediate PCa interactions with the immune system, and these interactions can be modified through selective targeting in combination with checkpoint blockade to expand the therapeutic potential of immunotherapy in PCa. We will leverage our team's deep experience in clinically grounded molecular characterization and preclinical models that can test immunotherapy combinations in PCa to define the processes that govern the immunotherapy landscape in PCa. The proposed specific aims are: 1) Define the systemic and infiltrating immune states in PCa associated with clinical response to checkpoint blockade; 2) Establish the immunologic impact of chromatin dysregulation and inhibition in PCa; and 3) Determine the impact of existing DNA damaging agents for sensitizing PCa to PD-1 blockade. This proposal leverages the extensive, novel, and complementary resources at both Dana-Farber/Broad Institute and University of California, San Francisco, led by highly collaborative investigators and an international scientific team, to address the hypotheses outlined herein. Through a combination of functional, molecular, and clinical approaches inherent in these studies, our team is poised to identify mCRPC cohorts that may benefit from this treatment paradigm, determine strategies to augment the use of checkpoint inhibitors in this disease, and mechanistically define the immune and tumor-intrinsic defects that drive immunoresistance in PCa. Broadly, this project will provide a unique approach for the Immuno-Oncology Translation Network (IOTN) community and enable discovery of anti-cancer immunotherapies strategies for PCa that may have larger relevance across the IOTN network and collaborating members of the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.

Using an “in situ vaccine” regimen consisting of 12 Gy focal external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and intratumoral (IT) injection of tumor-specific antibody (mAb) + IL2, we have eradicated solitary, large, cold syngeneic tumors in mice. This in situ vaccine converts the targeted tumor into a focus of enhanced tumor antigen presentation resulting in increased T-cell infiltration and potent T-cell memory. However, the presence of an identical but untreated second tumor (2°) on a mouse’s opposite flank inhibits the effect of this treatment, preventing eradication of the primary (1°) tumor treated with EBRT + IT mAb-IL2. In this setting, the untreated 2° tumor causes tumor- specific immune unresponsiveness to EBRT + IT mAb-IL2 at the 1° tumor. We refer to this as concomitant immune tolerance (CIT). We can overcome CIT, and eliminate both tumors by giving IT mAb-IL2 to the 1° tumor and EBRT to both the 1° and 2° tumors. Delivering as little as 2 Gy EBRT to the 2° tumor can overcome CIT. Clinically, delivery of EBRT (even low dose) to all sites of metastatic disease is problematic, but this can effectively be achieved using molecular targeted radiation therapy (MTRT). MTRT is increasingly entering clinical oncology practice and our UW team has led preclinical and clinical testing of a novel class of MTRT using alkylphosphocholine (APCh) analogs that selectively deliver radiation to cancers in vivo. These show tumor-selective uptake in virtually all mammalian tumor cells and tumor locations tested (including > 90 tumor lines and in patients across various clinical trials). In a syngeneic murine melanoma model, we have observed a potent synergy between systemically administered ICI and MTRT delivered using our next-generation APC analog, 90Y-NM600. In a project that builds upon the ongoing collaborative progress of our multidisciplinary team, we will now systematically optimize the potency of combining MTRT with immunotherapy to enhance the immune response against immunologically cold tumors. In murine models, we will: 1) expand on preliminary data showing potent synergy with the combination of MTRT and ICI, 2) evaluate the capacity of MTRT to overcome CIT and enhance systemic anti-tumor immune response in the setting of multiple tumors where one is treated with in situ vaccine (EBRT + IT mAb-IL2) alone or in combination with ICI. Because murine models do not replicate the size and spatial distribution of human metastatic cancer and because these factors strongly influence the dosimetry of MTRT, we will test the immunomodulatory effects of MTRT + in situ vaccine in large breed companion canines (pet dogs) with naturally occurring metastatic melanoma. The insights and treatment regimens developed in these studies should enable rapid translation to clinical testing in patients and potentially for any type of metastatic cancer.	90Y;Address;Anatomy;Animals;Antibodies;Antigen Presentation;Biology;Cancer Model;Canis familiaris;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Companions;Data;Disease;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Distant;Dose;Epitope spreading;External Beam Radiation Therapy;Generations;Goals;Half-Life;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Human;IL2 gene;Image;Immune;Immune Evasion;Immune Tolerance;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immunocompetent;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Infiltration;Injections;Intravenous;Isotopes;Length;Location;Low Dose Radiation;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metastatic Melanoma;Modality;Modeling;Molecular Target;Monoclonal Antibodies;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Mus;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Preclinical Testing;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radioisotopes;Regimen;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Safety;Site;Soft tissue sarcoma;Spatial Distribution;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Targeted Radiotherapy;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Translations;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Immunity;Ursidae Family;Vaccination;Vaccines;Veins;Vision;Work;analog;anti-tumor immune response;cancer site;checkpoint inhibition;dosimetry;efficacy testing;immunogenic;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;insight;mRNA Expression;melanoma;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoantigens;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;novel strategies;pre-clinical;prevent;protein expression;radiation effect;research clinical testing;response;sarcoma;synergism;systemic toxicity;treatment effect;tumor;tumor eradication;tumor microenvironment;uptake;virtual	UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON	MADISON	WI	UNITED STATES	Zachary Scott Morris,JAMEY P WEICHERT	DCTD	Mansoor M Ahmed	765000	$750k to $999k	765000	18-Sep-2018	18-Sep-2018	31-Aug-2023	RFA-CA-17-045	Moonshot

The growing population of older patients remains underrepresented in research that sets cancer care standards leading to significant disparities in outcomes. In our preliminary research, we found that: 1) close to 60% of older patients develop grade 3-5 toxicity (as measured by NCI's CTCAE) within three months of starting a new treatment regimen; items from geriatric assessment (GA) were significantly associated with toxicity; 2) older patients with advanced cancer frequently experience multiple symptoms that interfere with function and quality of life (QoL); and 3) older patients often experience toxicities that lead to early discontinuation of treatment, hospitalizations, and mortality. We have an unprecedented opportunity to leverage an existing multi-site cluster randomized study that is currently enrolling adults aged >70 years with age-related conditions who are starting a new treatment regimen for advanced cancer in the UR NCORP network (URCC 13059/“GAP”) (n=700). In addition to clinician-rated CTCAE, GAP captures PRO measures (PRO-CTCAE, GA, satisfaction) at baseline, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after the start of the new treatment regimen. Extensive data are collected on clinical tolerability metrics including treatment dose modifications, hospitalizations, and mortality. We will collaborate with the U01 consortium to: 1) develop and compare the trajectories of PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades 2-5 in older patients with age-related conditions; 2) evaluate associations between PRO- CTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with clinical tolerability metrics; 3) evaluate associations between PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with PRO endpoints (e.g., function, QoL, satisfaction); and 4) validate a model that identifies older patients with age-related conditions who are at high risk for poor tolerability from treatment for advanced cancer. Developed with stakeholders, our operational definition of tolerability is novel; it includes both clinical outcomes and PRO endpoints. The team, which includes expertise in clinical trials (Mohile, Morrow, Janelsins, Kamen), biostatistics and data science (Culakova, Heckler, Pandya, Ramsdale, Zand), PRO measurement (Mohile, Duberstein, Chapman, Flannery), and collaborations with CARG (Hurria, Dale) and patient advocates (SCOREBoard led by Canin) is uniquely suited to conduct this research. This research will address a critical gap in knowledge of how patient-reported toxicity informs tolerability of treatment in older patients with advanced cancer and age-related conditions.

These methods will harness the potential of the patient-reported outcomes version of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAETM) to provide previously unavailable patient perspectives on the tolerability of treatments (including targeted agents, immunotherapies, and other evolving treatments for which the type, severity, timing, and trajectory of adverse events is less known). Such information will help providers better identify and support patients at risk for treatment discontinuation, dose reductions, and treatment delays. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) perform longitudinal analyses of CTCAE and PRO-CTCAE data from trials conducted within the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, using traditional and innovative strategies to examine AE trajectories and to produce a new reporting standard that reflects severity and fluctuations over time; 2) examine PRO-CTCAE and CTCAE predictors of treatment adherence and discontinuation; and 3) validate the broader predictive value of GP5, a single item from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) shown to predict early treatment discontinuation among women with breast cancer taking aromatase inhibitors. The study will also explore two novel measurement models for PRO-CTCAE scores and CTCAE grades: a phenotypic model including co-occurrence of symptoms and a cumulative burden index (CBI) for characterizing the quantity of burden accumulated by patients over time. Analyses will include demographic factors and insurance status to identify potential disparities.

project	1U01CA239258-01	U01CA239258	9626217	2018	Enhancing cell therapy for brain tumors	Grant	ABSTRACT Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain cancer, with standard treatments based on surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy promoting an overall survival of approximately 15 months. This has led to a resurgence of interest in immune-based approaches. While augmenting immunity has been successful in other malignancies like melanoma and leukemia/lymphoma, their efficacy in treatment of brain tumors has been very limited. Tumor antigen heterogeneity, limited number of infiltrating lymphocytes at the tumor site, and failure of checkpoint inhibitor drugs to cross the blood brain barrier all represent major obstacles to effective immune-therapies in GBM. Altered immunity in patients with GBM further contributes to the poor prognoses of these tumors and their relative resistance to vaccine and checkpoint inhibitors. Utilizing healthy donor immune cells in the form of adoptive cell therapy may offer a more effective alternative. However, limited information is available on the properties of effector populations that would exert effective anti-tumor activity in the brain. Pioneering work by Dr. Rick Jones at Johns Hopkins University utilizing haploidentical donor transplant (haplo-BMT) for brain tumors offers an opportunity to test kinetics of infused healthy donor immune cells in this patient population, providing a glimpse of what donor immune cells can do against brain tumors. Previous experiences with haplo-BMT suggest that effector cells of the innate immunity – natural killer cells (NKs) and invariant natural killer T cells (iNKTs) – mediate anti-tumor activity with decreased frequency of relapse. Innate immune cells are also potentially advantageous in the brain tumor setting, which affords very little tolerance for the adverse events associated with (for example) CD19-CAR T cell based-therapies. Finally, both iNKT and NK cells can actively migrate to the site of GBM following the CCL2 gradient, the chemokine released by tumor cells and the surrounding tumor associated macrophages (TAM). Dr. Savoldo at University of North Carolina has unique expertise in the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transduced T cells and iNKT cells and Dr. Bollard at Children's National has extensive experience with the genetically modified T cells and NK cells. Hence, in this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that nontolerized innate immune cells (NKs and iNKTs) derived from healthy donors will promote anti- tumor immunity in patients GBM, and may be developed as effective cellular therapies. This overarching hypothesis will be tested in 3 Specific Aims where Dr. Jones (Aim 1) will compare the cellular signatures of iNKTs and NK cells isolated from healthy donors versus patients with GBM. In Aim 2, Dr. Savoldo and the UNC team will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of healthy donor iNKT and NK cells modified to express an anti- B7H3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and in Aim 3, Drs. Bollard and Cruz at CNMC overcome the inhibitory tumor microenvironment in GBM by targeting immune suppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and TGFβ.

Traditional germline genetic testing models, which include in-depth genetic counseling both before and after testing, are time intensive and place substantial demands on the limited genetic counselor workforce. A “mainstreaming” model, which allows for non-genetics healthcare providers to order genetic testing without pre-test genetic counseling, with support from genetic counselors at the time of result disclosure, has shown promise. Yet, past evaluations of mainstreaming models have been hampered by serious limitations: Studies were restricted to the context of BRCA1/2 testing and do not reflect the growing use of multigene panel testing (MGPT); rarely used rigorous experimental study designs or evaluated theoretically-relevant decision-making, psychosocial, and communication outcomes; have not capitalized on opportunities to improve post-test clinical and familial communication; and neither included nor addressed informational needs of minority and medically underserved patients. We overcome these limitations with the proposed study, the objective of which is to develop, test, and evaluate a linguistically and culturally appropriate mainstreaming (LCAM) model for hereditary cancer MGPT among cancer patients diverse in race/ethnicity, language, and education. We will first use formative research methods, including transcreation and cognitive interviewing, to adapt existing pre-test educational materials and post-test clinical communication materials for use among the diverse population treated at our community hospital partnering sites (Kings County Hospital Center, Queens Cancer Center). Next, we will conduct an RCT involving English, Haitian Creole, or Spanish-speaking patients diagnosed with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer (N=500). Patients will be randomized to obtain access to cancer MGPT through either: i) standard-of-care wherein in- depth pre-test and post-test genetic counseling are provided via telegenetics (i.e., videoconferencing delivered at the site clinic) with standard post-test clinical communication materials, or ii) LCAM intervention wherein patients receive the adapted pre-test educational materials with testing ordered by their oncologist, followed by post-test genetic counseling provided via telephone with adapted clinical communication materials. Patients will complete assessments of decision-making, psychosocial, and behavioral outcomes at baseline, upon deciding whether to have MGPT, and at 1-week and 6-months following receipt of their test results. Long-term engagement among patients who receive a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) result will also be explored one year after result receipt through uptake of an offer to discuss any changes in cancer risk or variant reclassification and an additional assessment. This research has the potential to transform genetic counseling and testing practice by promoting effective risk communication, decision making, and more equitable delivery of genomic medicine to those at risk of hereditary cancer syndromes.

Genetic counseling is therefore recommended for all AYAs with new cancer diagnoses, for whom results can lead to future cancer screening, risk-reducing surgeries, and reproductive counseling. Testing can also have a domino effect, identifying other affected relatives and reducing cancer risk in entire families. AYAs require unique considerations when communicating cancer risk due to wide variability in developmental and emotional maturity. Genetic counseling necessitates complex cognitive and affective processing from AYAs, ideally resulting in an active ownership of their condition and a commitment to life-long health behavior change. This tall order comes as AYAs are forming their identity, gaining parental independence, and considering future childbearing – often under the shadow of enormous personal or family losses from cancer. These factors complicate AYAs' ability to weigh tradeoffs of genetic testing and screening recommendations – sometimes with tragic consequences. Unfortunately, there have been few if any efforts to optimize cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs. The goal of this project is to develop, implement and test an AYA-specific intervention for cancer risk communication and decision-making. Our interdisciplinary team of experts in health communication, cancer genetics, oncology, and pediatric psychology from 4 major Cancer Risk Programs will develop AYA-RISE (Risk Information and Screening Education), a web-based intervention comprised of (1) an interactive chatbot designed to communicate genetic information to AYAs in developmentally appropriate ways; and (2) an individualized patient portal, serving as an educational resource and longitudinal repository for cancer risk and screening information. Iterative user testing with qualitative feedback from AYAs will be used to optimize the program prior to conducting a type I hybrid implementation effectiveness trial of AYA-RISE. Our aims are: Aim 1: To refine and pilot AYA-RISE, adapting implementation to ensure feasibility and acceptability among AYAs with cancer risk syndromes, their family members, and providers. Aim 2: To test AYA-RISE among AYAs with cancer predisposition syndromes at 4 centers to determine impact on (1) patient knowledge of cancer risk and recommended screening; (2) psychological distress; (3) patient ownership of information; and (4) follow-up for recommended care. Aim 3: To evaluate implementation outcomes of AYA-RISE, including ways that AYAs use the chatbot and patient portal, and AYA, family, and provider experiences, to facilitate future dissemination. If successful, this study will yield a scalable, patient- and family-centered intervention to improve cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs and their families, with an ultimate goal of cancer risk reduction.

Hereditary cancer syndromes are more common than previously appreciated, and genetic testing is standard of care to establish these diagnoses. Genetic test results are also critical to guiding targeted therapies in patients with established tumors such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Genetic counselors have traditionally managed the testing process, but there is a critical shortage of counselors and they are not able to meet the demand for testing. Without a genetic counselor, effective communication of testing options, outcomes, and risks could be compromised. One of the most challenging decisions is the choice of gene panel. Multi- gene panels are now the norm, but panels can include as few as 5 or as many as 125 genes. Panels can include genes associated with a single tumor type or multiple tumor types, and genes with weaker evidence for pathogenicity may also be included. There is no consensus on what constitutes an ideal panel, and the choice of panel is therefore highly individualized. Innovative strategies to support patients facing these time-sensitive and complex pre-test decisions are needed. Decision aids are well-suited to address this challenge by providing education, facilitating the process of informed choice, clarifying personal preferences, and promoting shared decision making. We propose to develop an electronic decision aid to assist individuals in choosing a multi-gene panel with their medical oncologist instead of a genetic counselor. We will test the hypothesis that a decision aid without a genetic counselor can facilitate quality decisions around the selection of a specific multi-gene panel. In addition to positive changes in knowledge, shared decision making, and decisional conflict, we anticipate that the decision aid will increase access to genetic testing in a timely manner. Utilizing an effectiveness- implementation hybrid study design, we propose these specific aims: (1) To develop and pilot electronic decision aids for selection of a multi-gene panel in ovarian and pancreatic cancer patients. (2) To evaluate the efficacy of the decision aid with an oncologist versus a traditional genetic counselor session for multi- gene panel testing in a randomized clinical trial at multiple institutions. (3) To evaluate the effectiveness of implementation of the decision aid in multiple, diverse populations. These decision aids will establish a much needed and new paradigm for quality decision making and communication around multi-gene panel testing for inherited cancer syndromes. This format will uniquely address the current barriers that include the complex decision of which multi-gene panel to select, limited genetic counselor resources, and lack of time and expertise on the part of practicing oncologists.

Yet, access to genetic specialists is limited in many areas in the US, and <20% of eligible patients with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer complete genetic testing. Thus, there is an urgent need to consider alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of genetic testing, while maintaining adequate patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes. Our research has shown that providing remote services increases uptake of genetic testing in community practices increases uptake of genetic testing. Preliminary data from our ongoing NIH-funded RESPECT study has revealed high interest in a web-based eHealth alternative to traditional pre-test counseling and no significant no differences in pre- and post-disclosure outcomes when the web-based eHealth intervention is utilized as compared to participants who received traditional pre-test genetic counselor. To address the clinically significant need for alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of cancer genetic testing, while maintaining adequate patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes, we propose to recruit a nationally diverse “real- world” sample of 1000 patients who have access barriers to genetic testing and to conduct a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate web-based eHealth delivery alternatives for genetic education and testing. We hypothesize that our theoretically and stakeholder informed eHealth delivery alternatives can provide equal or better uptake of testing and outcomes of genetic testing as compared to the traditional model of pre- and post-test counseling with a genetic counselor. We will partner with several cancer advocacy groups (ASCO, breastcancer.org, Cancer Support Community, Pennsylvania Prostate Cancer Coalition) to recruit patients to this randomized non-inferiority study using a modified 2x2 design (Aims 1-2). In Arm 1, traditional pre-test (visit 1) and post-test (visit 2: disclosure) counseling will be provided remotely through the national Penn Telegenetics Program and compared to delivery arms where patients can complete pre-test and/or disclosure of results through a self-directed web-based eHealth intervention, either in place of, or as an adjunct to traditional genetic counseling. Concurrently, we will conduct a CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research)-informed process evaluation to understand moderators of intervention usage and patient outcomes and facilitators and barriers to future implementation and sustainability of this novel eHealth alternative delivery model for genetic services both within and beyond cancer care (Aim 3). We hypothesize that a rigorously developed theoretically and stake-holder informed eHealth delivery alternative provided through a centralized Telegenetics Program has the potential to provide equal or improved patient outcomes, while reducing genetic provider time and providing access to services in community practices where access to genetic services has been limited, providing opportunities to realize the promise of precision medicine in oncology.

Clinical studies show that autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains an efficacious consolidation treatment for eligible patients and a subset of transplant recipients achieve long-term control of disease. Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced by ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates inflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the potential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. We have recently utilized novel preclinical models to provide definitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific T cell immunity and the re-establishment of a state of immune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these systems is a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive populations and the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. These inhibitory pathways are highly amenable to immunotherapeutic approaches after ASCT that invoke long term survival. This proposal will utilize sophisticated protein and transcriptional based approaches to examine the relationship of T cell function in the peri-transplant period to subsequent survival and disease control in well-annotated clinical cohorts. A major focus will be the optimization of innovative immunotherapy approaches after ASCT in preclinical systems for clinical translation.

This approach holds promise to function as an effective immunotherapy against metastatic cancers in humans using monovalent Fab fragments (Mono-Fabs) specific for the CD3 complex that is associated with the TCR. In the absence of strong antigen, anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs do not stimulate T cell immune function because they do not crosslink receptors for intracellular signaling. However, when exposed to antigen, T cells treated with anti-CD3 Mono- Fabs increase their level of response to weak antigenic stimulation in vitro, indicating that the Fabs bound to CD3 alter the TCR/CD3 complex and enhance T cell triggering, an effect we denominate ‘receptor co- potentiation’. When tested in mice in vivo, anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs display therapeutic properties against metastatic melanoma that depend on the presence of T cells able to recognize antigens associated with the tumor. Since anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs target the TCR/CD3 complex, testing combinations with alternative immunotherapies that target other receptors on T cells was. Anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs showed a synergistic effect with the alternative immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibition or adoptive cell therapy, which resulted in significantly extended survival of the mice tested. Now, Mono-Fabs specific for human CD3 have been identified that may mediate T cell co-potentiation in vitro, as well produce anti-tumor T cell responses in two different and ccomplementary humanized-mouse models of metastatic melanoma. In the present proposal, transgenic mice expressing human CD3 will be crossed with inbred and outbred mouse strains in order to produce different degrees of genetic diversity to resemble adult humans. Additionally, so called “dirty mice” from pet stores will also be co-housed with human CD3-transgenic mice to induce levels of “foreign” and immune experience that better correspond with those observed in adult human immunotherapy patients. Mice from these various conditions will be used to determine the extent to which candidate anti-human CD3 Fabs display anti-tumor potential against metastatic melanoma (aim 1), in single and combination immunotherapies (with checkpoint inhibition and adoptive cell theapy), as well as the extent to which immunotoxicity occurs (aim 2). Results will inform the choice of optimal candidate(s) to subsequently undergo development for anti-cancer translational application. Finally, the CD3 signaling mechanism promoted by anti-human CD3e Fabs will be studied in a mechanismtic manner to better understand T cell co-potentiation (aim 3). If successful, this project will produce a novel modality of immunotherapy that may be exploited alone and/or to synergize other immunotherapies, and will provide a biochemical mechanistic basis for this function. The hope is that soon thereafter, experimentation might advance these studies to translational application with an ultimate goal of helping prolong survival of patients suffering from metastatic melanoma and additional malignancies.

project	1U01CA244452-01	U01CA244452	9869561	2019	Mechanisms of Exosome Driven Immunoregulation of Cancer Progression	Grant	PROJECT ABSTRACT: Antibodies against the immune checkpoint proteins PD-L1 and PD-1 have revolutionized cancer therapeutics resulting in durable remissions in many patients previous considered incurable. However, a majority of patients remain resistant and cancer types can vary greatly in their response rates. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the variation in response in order to improve cancer care. This proposal brings together a team of investigators with complementary expertise in basic, translational, and clinical science who share the long-term goal of finding novel approaches to categorize and personalize cancer treatments. Recent results from the investigators suggest a major role for the packaging of immune checkpoint proteins in exosomes underlying the variation in responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors among patients. Specifically, varying amounts of PD-L1 can be trafficked to exosomes, which in turn can act at a distance to suppress anti-tumor T cell function, enabling tumor progression, even in models resistant to anti-PD-L1 treatments. The objective of this proposal is to build on these findings by focusing on the mechanism of exosomal PD-L1 packaging, action, and resistance to therapeutic antibodies. In particular, the proposal will test the overall hypothesis that tumor cells can selectively package PD-L1 into exosomes that suppress T cell priming at distal sights in a fashion that is distinct from the cell-cell interactions of PD-L1 and PD-1 normally seen in the tumor bed. The hypothesis is premised on extensive preliminary data using in vitro and in vivo models showing that the relative fraction of PD-L1 packaged in exosomes versus retained in cells varies between cell lines, that suppression of exosomal PD-L1 can result in long-term systemic anti-tumor immunity, and that exosomal PD-L1 is resistant to anti-PD-L1 antibodies. To test the overall hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: 1) Uncover mechanisms underlying the selective packaging of PD-L1 into exosomes, 2) Evaluate the mechanistic basis of exosomal PD-L1’s impact on systemic immunity, 3) Dissect how exosomal PD-L1 interacts with and regulates its target cells. In aim 1, structure/function and proteomic approaches are proposed to identify the regulators of PD-L1 packaging into exosomes. Furthermore, associations between expression of these factors and resistance to therapy will be evaluated using primary patient samples. In aim 2, mouse-based immunological approaches and patient samples will be used to determine where in the immune axis exosomal PD-L1 functions. Uncovered insights will then be used to develop a novel therapeutic approach to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. In aim 3, microscopy and functional studies in in vitro models along with association studies with patient samples will be used to determine how exosomal PD-L1 interacts with its target cells potentially explaining its resistance to antibodies. The proposal is highly significant in that it is expected to provide new fundamental knowledge that can be used to identify and treat the large fraction of patients resistant to current immune therapies. While this proposal focuses on a subset of cancer models with a particular emphasis on prostate cancer, the paradigms uncovered are expected to be relevant across most if not all tumor types.

An effective vaccine exists that can prevent these cancers, but uptake of the HPV vaccine is low among young cancer survivors (fewer than 1 in 4 have received the vaccine). Lack of a healthcare provider recommendation for the HPV vaccine is the most common reason that cancer survivors fail to get the HPV vaccine. Strategies that are most successful in increasing HPV vaccine uptake in the general population focus on improving healthcare provider knowledge about the HPV vaccine, enhancing the skills that healthcare providers need to effectively recommend the vaccine to young people and their parents, and reducing barriers to receiving the vaccine. This proposed research will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an evidence-based intervention, adapted for use by healthcare providers in pediatric oncology clinics, to increase the uptake of HPV vaccine among young cancer survivors (9 to 17 years of age and at least one year off-therapy). If the intervention is effective in improving and sustaining increased uptake of the HPV vaccine in young cancer survivors, this study will contribute important information needed to move forward with testing the widespread use of the intervention in pediatric oncology practices. This proposed research addresses improving healthcare delivery and clinical outcomes for cancer survivors through prevention of HPV-associated cancers, which are high-priority research areas for the National Cancer Institute.	17 year old;Address;Adolescent;Age;Area;Cancer Survivor;Cancer Survivorship;Caring;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Clinic;Clinical;Cluster randomized trial;Communication;Confidence Intervals;Coupled;Disease;Effectiveness;Ensure;Evidence based intervention;Feedback;Future;General Population;Geography;Guidelines;Health Personnel;Health Promotion;Health behavior;Healthcare;Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination;Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine;Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm;Human Papillomavirus;Human papilloma virus infection;Hybrids;Immune;Immunization;Intervention;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Mission;Morbidity - disease rate;National Cancer Institute;Neoplasms;Odds Ratio;Oncogenic;Oncology;Outcome;Outcomes Research;Parents;Patients;Pediatric Oncology;Population;Prevention;Provider;Public Health;Randomized;Recommendation;Recovery;Research;Research Priority;Sampling;Secondary Cancer Prevention;Series;Survivors;Testing;Time;Training;United States National Institutes of Health;Vaccination;Vaccines;Vulnerable Populations;age group;cancer therapy;care providers;cervical and anal cancer;childhood cancer survivor;chronic infection;design;disability;effectiveness evaluation;effectiveness testing;evidence base;follow-up;health care delivery;health disparity;high risk;implementation science;implementation strategy;improved;intervention program;peer;post intervention;prevent;skills;success;survivorship;therapy development;uptake;young cancer survivor	UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM	BIRMINGHAM	AL	UNITED STATES	James  Klosky,WENDY  LANDIER	DCCPS	Genevieve M Grimes	1856897	>=$1M	1856897	18-Sep-2020	18-Sep-2020	31-Aug-2023	RFA-CA-19-033	Moonshot
project	1U01CA246568-01	U01CA246568	9892593	2019	Utility of memantine in preventing cognitive dysfunction in children receiving cranial radiotherapy	Grant	ABSTRACT The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral memantine daily for 6 months, when compared to placebo, is associated with reduction in decline of cognitive function at 12 months in children ages 4-18 receiving cranial radiotherapy (RT) for primary central nervous system tumors and to correlate protective effects of memantine with imaging biomarkers. Radiotherapy is a proven curative therapeutic tool in the treatment of primary brain tumors. However, cranial RT results in significant cognitive morbidity. The mechanisms of radiation-induced injury result in a picture that is a combination of the small vessel disease seen with vascular dementia as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s dementia. Ischemia and injury can induce excessive NMDA stimulation and lead to excitotoxicity, and pre- clinical data suggests that selective blocking of the NMDA receptor can restore long-term potentiation and restore learning in both models of ischemia as well as models of radiation injury. Memantine is a non- competitive, low-affinity, open- channel NMDA blocker, which has been shown to be neuroprotective in pre- clinical models. In two placebo- controlled phase III trials, memantine proved to be effective treatment for Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, especially for patients with small-vessel disease. Memantine has also proven effective in reducing cognitive dysfunction in adults receiving whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases. Memantine delayed time to cognitive decline and reduced the rate of decline in memory, executive function and processing speed. Importantly, cognitive function in patients receiving memantine remained stable even after memantine was discontinued; suggesting memantine had a protective effect rather than simply a therapeutic effect. In this study, we propose evaluating the efficacy of memantine in preventing cognitive dysfunction in pediatric patients receiving cranial radiation through the clinical trial mechanism of the Children’s Oncology Group. This study is novel in that children will undergo early cognitive evaluations (baseline prior to radiation, 3, 6, and 12 months post-radiation) with a brief computerized testing battery that we will correlate with formal cognitive testing as well with long-term cognitive function (30 and 60 months) assessed with both methods. If successful, this study will provide validated early cognitive assessment time points that correlate with late cognitive toxicity and result in an framework for accelerated study design that will allow for early assessment of efficacy for future neuro-protectant trials. Dose- and volume-dependent reduction in brain volume is seen after radiotherapy exposure and is associated with cognitive decline. We hypothesize that neuroprotection with memantine will also preserve relevant brain volume and this will correlate with domain- specific improvements in cognitive function. We will use quantitative volumetric MRI analysis to correlate protective effects of memantine with brain substructure (white matter, hippocampus, frontal lobes etc) volume changes over time and correlate with cognitive assessments. Radiographic analysis will provide proof-of- principle for the mechanism of action of memantine as well as a biomarker that can be utilized in future trials of radio-protectants, which is especially important for young patients or patients not neurologically capable of completing cognitive assessments but who may benefit the most from neuroprotective interventions.

project	1U01CA246612-01	U01CA246612	9893629	2019	Using Information Technology to Improve Outcomes for Children Living with Cancer	Grant	This application plans to develop a program, Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and Reporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS), to enable timely mitigation and management of unrelieved symptoms for children with cancer. The SyMon-SAYS will administer, score, interpret and display the results of symptom assessments in “real-time” between clinic visits in cancer care ambulatory settings, when patients are likely to be more symptomatic. We hypothesize that this system can facilitate prompt identification of problematic symptoms; consequently, with the availability of graphical symptom reports over time, timely providers’ clinical care, and an informative symptom management booklet, patients will become informed about their condition and take an active role in treatment, which will further improve self-management skills. Better self-management promotes adherence to treatment plans, builds individual capacity, improves interaction between patients and caregivers, reduces the use of medical specialists, and optimizes clinical outcomes across the lifespan throughout the treatment and disease continua. The proposed waitlist control randomized trial is based on our preliminary study testing the feasibility of the patient-centered SyMon-SAYS in a pediatric oncology clinic. Results showed that the SyMon-SAYS was acceptable to patients/parents and they were willing to use it during their routine clinical care. Clinicians expressed interest in receiving reports yet preferred to review them in the medical record. Based on what we learned from this pilot, we now propose to integrate the SyMon-SAYS system into the electronic health record (EHR), to streamline the alert notification with clinician workflow by using EHR (Epic) messaging, and to include a broader range of symptoms. Patients and parents will complete the weekly symptom assessment and review the symptom report by logging into the Epic MyChart patient portal. Instead of using a standalone SyMon-SAYS app, we will align the SyMon-SAYS program with the Epic EHR. We plan to conduct a single institution modified waitlist control randomized trial of 200 children (ages 8-17) with cancer over 16 weeks (Group A: 16-week SyMon-SAYS intervention; Group B: 8-week usual care and then 8-week SyMon-SAYS intervention) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) evaluate effectiveness of SyMon-SAYS at week-8 and its maintenance effects at week-16. We hypothesize that Group A (versus Group B) will report decreased parent-perceived barriers to managing their children’s symptoms, decreased patient symptom burden, increased patient and parent self-efficacy, and ultimately increased patient HRQOL at week-8 and no significant differences between Groups A & B at week-16; 2) evaluate influential factors to Aim 1, including contextual patient and parent factors, adherence to the SyMon- SAYS intervention, and symptom communication; and 3) evaluate predictors of adherence to the SyMon-SAYS intervention and preference of SyMon-SAYS versus usual care.

To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections, almost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and communities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and affordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and more likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies among AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating that the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing PA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0- 20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal level) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a private Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community level) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA tracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other activities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be recruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site RCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group, to achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 - To improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life. Analyses of hypothesized mediation factors for Aims 1-3 and post-trial qualitative interviews among participants with and without private health insurance will provide explanatory knowledge to help refine intervention procedures and tailor the intervention for future RCTs among patient subgroups who will most benefit. If shown to be efficacious, this mHealth intervention to improve PA in AYA survivors is highly scalable because smartphones and social media are widespread, PA trackers are popular and affordable, goal setting can be automated, and social media activities do not require specialized staff.

Although cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity are the earliest and most dramatic immune related adverse events (irAEs) after CARTx, severe manifestations are transient and only affect a minority of patients. In contrast, on-target, off- tumor depletion of non-malignant B lineage cells affects the majority of patients and all long-term responders. CD19 expression declines as B cells differentiate into plasma cells, whereas BCMA is selectively expressed by plasma cells. Since plasma cells are responsible for maintaining long-lived antibodies and naïve/memory B cells are important for generating new immunity, CD19 versus BCMA-CARTx may differentially affect preexisting immunity and vaccine responses. Dr. Hill’s goal is to understand the long-term effects of CARTx on humoral immunity. This proposal incorporates the expertise of an outstanding group of researchers in infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, epidemiology, laboratory medicine, and statistics who are dedicated to ensuring the success of this innovative research proposal. They will leverage their expertise and high-volume immunotherapy programs to achieve the following aims. The first Aim involves a prospective observational cohort study of 130 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 50 pediatric CD19, 30 adult BCMA) with relapse-free survival ≥6 months. Dr. Hill will use a novel systematic viral epitope scanning method (VirScan) to longitudinally characterize the antivirome to 206 viral pathogens. These results will describe, and identify correlates of, antivirome diversity metrics at 6- and 12-months post-CARTx. VirScan will allow for a nuanced assessment of the differential impacts of CARTx on humoral immune competence. The second Aim will utilize samples from Aim 1 to determine the effect of CARTx on the durability of preexisting humoral immunity to vaccine-preventable infections and the proportion of patients lacking seroprotection after CARTx. These data will expand on Aim 1 to inform vaccination strategies. In the third Aim, Dr. Hill will perform a prospective observational study of 95 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 25 pediatric CD19, and 20 adult BCMA) to define the frequency and correlates of positive vaccine responses ≥6 months after CARTx. Patients will be vaccinated for S. pneumoniae, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, H. influenza b, and hepatitis A and B according to institutional guidelines. This proposal will address critical knowledge gaps by employing innovative methods to elucidate the scope of pathogen-specific deficits in humoral immunity, and whether vaccination can mitigate these irAEs, after CARTx. The findings will guide evidence-based strategies for infection prevention, such as vaccination or immunoglobulin replacement, to improve outcomes in this rapidly growing population of high-risk individuals.

project	1U01CA247573-01	U01CA247573	9921971	2020	Engineering immunotherapeutic probiotics to mitigate irAE	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In recent years, the field of cancer immunotherapy has seen a renaissance – with the use of monoclonal antibodies that target immune checkpoints to activate anticancer immune responses demonstrating unparalleled clinical success. Several of these therapies have now gained FDA approval and are part of routine treatment regimens for several malignancies. Despite the overall success of immunotherapeutic regimens, existing modalities present complications that current research efforts seek to overcome: (1) systemic delivery of checkpoint blockade monoclonal antibodies lead to diverse and unpredictable immune-related adverse events (irAE), (2) boosting responses from the endogenous antitumor repertoire often relies on the existence of pre- primed antitumor T cells, which in the case of highly immunosuppressive tumors or those with low mutational burden may be extremely rare, and (3) attempts to combine immunotherapies to additively boost T cell responses demonstrate increased on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Thus, to circumvent toxicity and immunosuppression, contemporary strategies focus on developing methods to deliver potent immunostimulants directly into a tumor, locally priming antitumor T cells to attack disseminated metastases exhibiting a similar antigenic profile. Bridging these observations, the goals of this proposal are to engineer probiotic strains of bacteria that selectively colonize colorectal cancer (CRC) and locally release immune checkpoint blockade. We hypothesize that this approach will result in more robust and diversified antitumor T cell immunity and promote the clearance of colonized primary and metastatic colorectal cancer lesions and systemically growing CRC-derived foci. The primary innovations of this proposal are in engineering probiotics as an immunotherapeutic delivery vector to locally release high-dose immune checkpoint blockade. Specifically, the proposed system has several advantages over current therapeutic strategies, including: (1) tumor-specific production of immunotherapies and LPS adjuvant, (2) bacteria lysis, leading to effective release of novel immunotherapeutics and LPS, (3) local delivery of novel immunotherapeutics that are toxic to deliver systemically, and (4) oral delivery of probiotics that selectively colonize CRC metastases. This work seeks to shift current research and clinical practice paradigms to overcome current limitations of immunotherapies, by providing a unique vehicle to locally deliver immunotherapies that stimulate antitumor immunity while preventing systemic toxicity and mitigating irAE.

project	1U01CA247576-01	U01CA247576	9921965	2020	Adrenergic modulation of cellular immune functions in CAR T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome	Grant	Immunotherapy using tumor-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells (CART) is a rapidly- emerging, promising cancer therapy that can elicit rapid, durable clinical responses, seen in anti-CD19 CART (CART19)-treated CD19+ B-cell malignancies. However, CART-evoked severe or fatal immune-related adverse events (irAE) including cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) are significant clinical barriers and safety concerns that impede CART use in cancer patients, even with strict patient monitoring and supportive care. Current tools for mitigating such immunotoxicities/CRS target individual cytokines/receptors (e.g. IL-6R, IL-1Ra, GM-CSF) or nonspecific immunosuppression, but preventing and treating such toxicity will require better understanding of cellular/molecular mediators of CART-induced CRS. This project aims to overcome these barriers and enable more effective interventions against immunotoxicities, and thus more effective CART treatments, building upon the PIs' novel, potentially translatable findings of a key role of catecholamines (CATs) in shaping CART therapy- associated immune activation. We found that blocking CAT synthesis both reduced CRS during CART therapy in mice and also enhanced its tumor eradication, and also found that CAT levels are elevated in patients with CART-evoked CRS, and correlated with symptoms and IL-6 levels, suggesting CATs contribute to human CRS pathophysiology. The project's goal is to identify the mechanistic CRS-modulating roles of these novel CAT actions and their impacts on macrophages and anti-tumor responses, and assess translational potential for improving CART cancer therapy outcomes using human patient samples. Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the mediating α1-AR subtype and its role in modulating CART-evoked cytokine release and anti-tumor responses in vitro and in vivo, based on our finding that CAT-associated cytokine release is mediated by α1-adrenergic receptors (α1-AR), of as-yet unknown subtype(s). We will identify the α1-AR subtype(s) that mainly mediate(s) CAT-evoked cytokine production in macrophages and CART, using in vitro co-culture assays and a mouse CART therapy model via genetic knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) of α1-AR subtypes. 2) Determine the impact of myeloid-derived CATs on cytokine release and myeloid function during CART-therapy in vitro and in a mouse model, by inactivating CAT synthesis in myeloid cells via tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) KO, and assess its impact on cytokine release and macrophage function in a co-culture assay and in vivo using a LysM-Cre-mediated TH KO mouse. 3) Assess CAT induction in human patients during CART therapy, and CATs' dual impacts on irAE and tumor responses, and potential utility of CAT measures and blockers in predicting and preventing CRS, by quantifying circulating CAT and cytokine levels in patient serum samples collected during CART therapy, and evaluating correlations of CAT levels with clinical and laboratory CRS indices, anti-tumor responses and survival.

project	1U01CA250549-01	U01CA250549	10004385	2020	Development and implementation of multiplex methods to understand the biology and heterogeneity of patient-derived cancer models	Grant	Abstract Experimental models of cancer provide the means both to decipher the molecular basis of cancer and to develop new therapeutic agents. To date, most cancer research has employed established cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models. Although these models have provided tremendous insight into many aspects of cancer initiation and progression, each of these models has important limitations, including adaptation to culture (cell lines), lack of genomic instability (mouse models), and inadequate representation of the spectrum of mutations and subtypes of human cancers. Next generation cancer models (NGCMs) such as organoid models have recently been developed. NGCMs address many deficits of prior models and promise to accelerate cancer research and experimental therapeutic efforts.  Recent methodological advances now make it possible to create patient-derived cancer cell lines and organoids with increased efficiency. When coupled with genomic analysis, these new models may facilitate new insights into human cancers. However, organoids require complex culture conditions and display distinct properties that pose challenges for implementation of standard molecular and cell biology techniques. To facilitate widespread use of organoid models within the research community, we must develop innovative technologies to overcome these challenges and enable study of organoids for a range of cancer phenotypes.  In this Project, we will build on our expertise in the development of genome scale and informatic methods as well as our work to derive many of the HCMI models with the goal of developing high throughput approaches to perform genetic and small molecule screens in patient-derived organoids created by the Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI). In addition, we will use innovative methods to interrogate cell state plasticity and heterogeneity in these models. These studies will allow the cancer research community to perform both high and low throughput analyses in patient-derived models and to provide deep insight into the stability and phenotypes represented by these models. While we will focus our technology development efforts using pancreatic cancer organoids, we anticipate that the approaches developed in this proposal will be widely applicable to many different models from a range of cancer types.  In Aim 1, we will develop and implement a highly multiplexed method to screen patient-derived organoid models with both small molecules and genetic reagents. These studies will provide a powerful approach to interrogating HCMI models at high throughput. In Aim 2, we will build on our preliminary studies that indicate that patient-derived organoids exhibit heterogeneity and rapid shifts in expressed phenotypes. We will interrogate the dynamics of these state changes and assess the degrees of heterogeneity in these models using newly developed physical and sequencing methodology. In Aim 3, we will build on Project Achilles and the DepMap (www.DepMap.org) to create and implement an optimized genome scale CRISPR-Cas9 library that permits the systematic genetic interrogation of genetic dependencies in patient-derived organoids.  We anticipate that these studies will create new methods that permit rigorous evaluation of HCMI models as well as the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer. More broadly, these studies will provide critical proof of principle that these methods can be used by others to study specific phenotypes in next generation cancer models such as organoids.

These Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter Organoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) include: Synthetic Promoter Activated Recombination of Kaleidoscopic Organoids (SPARKO), Combinatorial Genetics En Masse (CombiGEM), and single-cell RNA sequencing panorama (Scanorama). SPARKO can annotate heterogeneous cancer populations in living cells via fluorescent protein expression libraries to make multi- colored tumor organoids. CombiGEM can rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets via large-scale, massively parallel, and unbiased combinatorial genetic screens. Scanorama can integrate the analysis of large datasets of single-cell transcriptomics via sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. These tools focus on barcoding strategies to enable accurate tracking and analysis of individual tumor cells that harbor distinct genetic aberrations, and substantially expand the utility of the Next Generation Cancer Models (NGCMs) for cancer mechanistic investigations or therapeutic discovery. The StarOrchard tools enable targeted genetic perturbations in annotated heterogeneous tumor phenotypes without destroying cells for sequencing. These tools will be applied to a large number and variety of NGCMs to optimize experimental protocol. To ensure success, we have convened an outstanding team: PI Timothy K. Lu, MD, PhD, has made strikingly original contributions to Synthetic Biology tools that enable high-throughput genetic interrogation of cancer cell drug dependency; PI Ömer Yilmaz, MD, PhD, has extensive expertise in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and has developed novel technologies to maintain patient-derived colon cancer organoids for in vivo modeling; and PI Bonnie Berger, PhD, will use her expertise in bioinformatics and her Scanorama algorithm to integrate data across all tumor types based on dynamic single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We are also supported by leading experts in cancer biology and various cancer types at both the basic science and clinical oncology frontiers of cancer research.

Historical cancer cell lines have been selected for their rapid proliferation on tissue culture plastic, which has made them amenable to high throughput screening such as genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screens. However, the historical lines have large gaps in their representation of the diversity of human cancer, and they may lack physiological relevance given their optimization for rapid proliferation. Next generation HCMI models address these concerns, but will require the development of new methods to make them useful. Specifically, standard approaches to genome editing (involving first creating Cas9- stably expressing lines and then introducing guide RNAs) will not work for slowly proliferating cells often growing in 3D. We will therefore develop all-in-one genome editing vector systems that will make it possible to bring the power of genome editing to HCMI models. In addition, standard viability read-outs of such “drop-out” screens involve the growth of cells over many population doublings. But for slowly proliferating HCMI models, alternative readouts will be required for efficient screening. We will therefore develop short-term single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) methods that will serve as surrogate read-outs for long-term viability. Given the clinical annotation associated with HCMI models, there is also enormous opportunity to expand the use of these models beyond viability measures to more complex, physiologically relevant phenotypes such as organ-specific metastatic potential. We will therefore develop methods that make it possible to determine the metastatic potential for next generation cancer models, and we will create a public resource of the metastasis map (MetMap) for at least 50 HCMI models. All data and protocols will be made publicly available without restriction, all reagents will be made available via Addgene, and all modified models made available to ATCC for distribution. Importantly, throughout the project, all cell models will be rigorously monitored for evidence of genetic and epigenetic drift. At the conclusion of the proposed project, we expect to have generated a set of tools and data that will help propel the future of cancer precision medicine based on next generation cancer models.	3-Dimensional;Address;Bar Codes;Benchmarking;Brain;CRISPR screen;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Model;Cancer cell line;Cell model;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Communities;Complex;Computational Science;Consumption;Data;Development;Dropout;Ensure;Enzymes;Epigenetic Process;Future;Gene Expression Profiling;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Screening;Growth;Guide RNA;Human;Immunodeficient Mouse;Injections;Kidney;Knock-out;Libraries;Liver;Lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organ;Organoids;Outcome;Phenotype;Physiological;Population;Proliferating;Protocols documentation;Reagent;Research;Resources;System;Systems Biology;Time;Translational Research;Ultrasonography;anticancer research;base;bone;cell growth;cost;experimental study;functional genomics;gene discovery;genome editing;genome-wide;high throughput screening;in vivo;innovation;model development;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;next generation;patient response;precision medicine;precision oncology;scale up;screening;single-cell RNA sequencing;targeted treatment;technology development;tissue culture;tool;tumor;tumor microenvironment;vector	BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.

project	1U01CA254822-01	U01CA254822	10086540	2020	A population-based virtual solution to reduce gaps in genetic risk evaluation and management in families at high risk for hereditary cancer syndromes:  The Georgia-California GeneLINK Trial	Grant	Project Abstract: There is growing evidence that targeting genetic risk evaluation (GRE) in families where a cancer susceptibility gene pathogenic variant (PV) has been identified may be the most cost-effective approach to reduce the population burden of cancer through prevention. However, there are enormous challenges to implementing successful cascade genetic risk evaluation in families with hereditary cancer syndromes. The clinical context of GRE after cancer diagnosis is increasingly complex: As MGP testing has become the norm, guideline organizations have converged on a list of >40 cancer susceptibility genes in which PVs are clinically actionable, with wide variability in cancer threat and a myriad of strategies for prevention and early detection. A daunting challenge is that the cancer patient is responsible for communication and engagement of relatives for GRE. Despite the shared health threat among at risk relatives (ARRs), the social and contextual factors that affect family communication are complex. Furthermore, ARRs are dispersed world- wide and receive care in disparate health care practices. Importantly, there is little incentive and limited resources for clinicians to engage cancer patients’ relatives and genetic counseling services are increasingly strained. Given the lack of guidance for families, it is not surprising that most ARRs of cancer patients with PVs do not undergo GRE. We are uniquely positioned to develop and optimize a direct-to-family virtual genetic risk evaluation and testing solution offered to all at risk relatives of a population-based sample of adults recently diagnosed with cancer in Georgia and California who tested positive for a clinically relevant PV. We will use a unique data infrastructure we pioneered to identify and invite a diverse cohort of cancer patients with clinically relevant PVs and their families to participate in our study. We propose a 2 x 3 factorial randomized trial of 900 patients diagnosed in 2018-2019 in the two states who had a clinically significant PV detected by genetic testing that will offer genetic risk evaluation and testing to all 1st and 2nd degree relatives. We will evaluate the effects of two intervention design features on patient- and relative-centered outcomes: 1) the level of personalized family genetic risk support (a technology assisted personally tailored patient and family member education and communication tool called the Family Genetic Health Program, FGHP) vs. the FGHP plus direct assistance from a human FGHP Navigator); and 2) the price offered to the relatives for the genetic test (standard $200 vs. $100 vs. $50 per test). We will determine the independent effects of the two design features on 1) the cancer patient’s appraisal of communication and their engagement with relatives about hereditary cancer and GRE; 2) the invited relative’s appraisal of decision-making and receipt of genetic testing; and 3) on the enrolled relative’s completion of formal GRE. We will also explore the effect of the features on the outcomes across patient SES subgroups.

Rather, it is critical to access appropriate follow-up care that may include cancer risk management (CRM) options for individuals and their at-risk family members. Current gaps in implementation of guideline-adherent follow-up care based on inherited cancer genetic test results include both over and under treatment among those with pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Furthermore, we are missing the opportunity to magnify the uptake and impact of testing among family members who are at high risk due to suboptimal family communication (FC) of genetic test results and cancer family history. Our highly innovative and practice-changing study is designed to shift the paradigm by which individuals with P/LP variants and VUS in inherited cancer genes are provided with information to enhance guideline-adherent CRM and FC of test results. Through our proposed type I effectiveness-implementation hybrid randomized control mixed methods study, we will test two interventions with a diverse group of 600 individuals with a P/LP variant or a VUS result in a variety of inherited cancer genes for which CRM guidelines are available. Intervention A is focused on increasing guideline- adherent CRM (LivingLabReport), and Intervention B is focused on increasing FC and subsequent family testing (GeneSHARE). Alongside developing, refining, and testing interventions to improve guideline-adherent CRM and FC, we will study the implementation of these interventions across racially, geographically, and socio- economically diverse populations and settings. The information gathered through testing effectiveness and implementation of the interventions will be used to develop, modify and pilot test adaptive stepped interventions with the potential to efficiently maximize effectiveness in improving guideline-adherent CRM and FC. This transdisciplinary effort, enriched for accrual of Blacks, rural dwellers, and other underserved populations, will inform policy and the development of scalable models for delivering evidence-based care. Ultimately, our study will help address the need for access to effective information to guide CRM and enhance FC in diverse populations across various genes and settings which is greatly needed if the population at large is to benefit from genomic advances in this era of personalized medicine.

Methods for their reliable identification in tumors of moderate mutational burden such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are lacking, however, as are preclinical experimental platforms for utilizing human material to understand the possibilities and impediments in enabling NeoAg-specific T cells to eradicate established tumors. Working with a focused and collaborative team with expertise in cellular and molecular immunology, bioinformatics, and translational oncology, we have developed a set of novel tools and approaches to address the complex tumor/immune ecosystem in new and incisive ways. These include a unique new model of tobacco-induced HNSCC carcinogenesis which recapitulates many key features of the human disease including gene expression patterns of activated oncogenes, a powerful new combined bioinformatic and functional analysis platform the identification of NeoAg by these tumors can be recognized by the host immune system, a novel preclinical model of combination radio-immunotherapy through which NeoAg-specific responses can be induced and sustained (Sharabi/Sharma), and finally, a new preclinical model of tumor-induced unresponsiveness in the setting of adoptive cellular therapy using human HNSCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors and patient-matched tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) specific for an identified NeoAg. Together, these studies will address the hypothesis that autologous NeoAg-specific T cells can eradicate HNSCC tumors as well as defining the key quantitative and qualitative parameters governing therapeutic efficacy.

project	1U01DE028233-01	U01DE028233	9625949	2018	Targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and immuno-radiotherapy for oral cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT: Radiation therapy (RT) is a mainstay of cancer treatment. However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it possible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence at a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor cells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune- stimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine RT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the types of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating effects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral cancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate. Studies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an immunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti- tumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor microenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1) determine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer to RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the immunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug formulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will accomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance in mouse oral cancer models. In Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment with RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses. In Aim 3 we will develop a novel drug delivery system that can enhance delivery of inhibitors of MDSC function directly to the tumor and tumor-infiltrating MDSC.

project	1U01DE029188-01	U01DE029188	9869230	2019	Defining mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT PD1 checkpoint blockade with nivolumab or pembrolizumab has given new hope for poor prognosis recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, but response rates of only 15-20% highlight the need for continued investigation. In this application, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team to address tumor cell intrinsic and adaptive resistance programs that are a critical barrier to immunotherapy. Together, this targeted and discovery based approach coupled with human functional immunophenotyping aims to generate new translational approaches to improving response rates for HNSCC patients. The foundation of this proposal is based on supporting data showing robust preclinical modeling platforms that span the spectrum of clinical responses to anti-PD1 therapy including response, intrinsic and adaptive resistance. Using high dimensional time of flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and an isogenic model of response and resistance, we identified distinct tumor microenvironmental remodeling with anti-PD1 and anti- CTLA4 therapies. We also completed a genome scale CRISPR screen for T cell recognition in a PD1 resistant HNSCC model and identified 355 candidate genes that may regulate this interaction. Candidates included ones that may be relevant in all cancers as well as ones specific to HNSCCs. A major category to emerge from this and other screens represents targets in the chromatin accessibility pathway. We validated a top screen candidate that modulates chromatin accessibility, the histone methyltransferase and transcriptional regulator Ezh2, and identified reduced anti-PD-1 resistance in combination with Ezh2 targeting. These data illustrate the validity of our approach as well as potential for clinical translation, as agents targeting Ezh2 are currently in clinical development. In a separate study of immunotherapy treated HNSCC patients, we identified mutations in SMARCA4, a catalytic subunit key for the PBAF nucleosome remodeling complex, in immunotherapy responsive HNSCC patients, highlighting chromatin remodelers as modulators of immunotherapy response in patients and the potential for improved clinical management by targeting these activities in conjunction with immunotherapy. In the proposed work, we will complete analysis of Ezh2 targeting with further validation of candidate immunotherapy resistance modulators. Coupled with these preclinical studies we will complete functional immunophenotyping of human HNSCC patients using CyTOF and a novel patient derived organotypic platform. In parallel to these preclinical approaches, we have a strong clinical trial portfolio including a novel neoadjuvant pembrolizumab clinical trial that has shown surprising pathologic response in a subset of patients and highlights this approach as an ideal setting in which to address resistance mechanisms in previously untreated patients. We will interrogate genomic data from our neoadjuvant trial to assess resistance mechanisms defined in preclinical models. In conclusion, this integrated approach will define mechanistic and therapeutic approaches to address the intrinsic immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC.

However, over 85% of the patients cannot benefit from this strategy, largely due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in established cancers. Oral leukoplakias / Oral Epithelial Dysplasias (OEDs) precede HNC and offer a unique time window for disease eradication. However, surgical resection in the orofacial region results in significant morbidity and function loss, and more importantly, cannot reverse field cancerization. A subset of OEDs transform into malignancy despite vigilant follow-ups. Frequent immune cell infiltration is a common feature of OEDs, however, little is known about when and how OEDs evade from immuno-surveillance and reach a point-of-no-return. In addition, it remains unclear which sub- group of OEDs is more likely to suppress host immunity and establish themselves as high-risk lesions. Amplification of the chromosome locus 3q26.3 is a defining genomic feature of HNC, and two oncogenes at this locus inhibit innate immune sensing pathways and elicit a metabolic restraint in the TME, which collectively disadvantage anti-tumor immune cells. We have developed strategies to bypass the inhibition of innate immune sensing and synthesized a novel drug-like molecule that exhibits potent metabolic remodeling potential and anti-tumor activity in vivo. We constructed two unique genetically engineered mouse models, which can model a spectrum of OED/HNC lesions with high-fidelity histologic and immunophenotypic resemblance to human diseases, to recapitulate 3q26.3-driven OED transformation. We also identified unique collections of case-control and longitudinal paired OED/HNC specimens, which allow us to validate key findings on the temporal shift of exploitable immune targets with clinical specimens. The overarching goal of this translational program is to test the hypothesis that 3q26.3 amplification is a key early high-risk event that leads to OED immune escape and that a combination of metabolic remodeling agent with immunotherapy effectively prevents OED progression. Thus, this proposal is fully responsive to the RFA-CA-19-014 and is focused on the deeper understanding of the time-course of immune landscape shift as pre-malignant lesions progress, using 3q26.3 amplification-driven OEDs as a high-risk disease model. We will qualify a novel metabolic remodeling drug-like molecule as a priming agent to maximally improve immuno-prevention. The 3q26.3 amplification is not unique to HNC and commonly found in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, esophagus and skin, hence, our findings will help address a broad class of public health concerns.	3q26;Address;Agonist;Automobile Driving;Bypass;CD8B1 gene;Cells;Chromosomes;Clinical;Collection;Cross-Priming;Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes;Dendritic Cells;Disadvantaged;Disease;Disease model;Effector Cell;Epithelial;Erythroplasia;Esophageal carcinoma;Event;Excision;Exhibits;Gene Expression Profile;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Glucose;Glycolysis;Glycolysis Pathway;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Histologic;Human;Hypoxia;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immune response;Immunity;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;Infiltration;Interferon Type I;Interferons;Intraepithelial Neoplasia;Lead;Lesion;Longitudinal cohort;Lymphocyte;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic stress;Modeling;Molecular Profiling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mucous Membrane;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oral;Oral Leukoplakia;PIK3CA gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Premalignant;Prevention;Prevention strategy;Public Health;Regimen;Resolution;Signal Transduction;Skin Carcinoma;Specimen;Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma;Stains;Subgroup;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Time;Tumor Burden;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Warburg Effect;cancer cell;case control;combinatorial;design;effective therapy;extracellular;head and neck cancer patient;high risk;high risk population;human disease;immune activation;immune checkpoint blockade;improved;in vivo;individualized medicine;inhibitor/antagonist;loss of function;malignant mouth neoplasm;mutant;novel;novel therapeutics;oral cavity epithelium;orofacial;prevent;programs;public health relevance;recruit;response;restraint;tumor;tumor hypoxia;tumor microenvironment	UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR	ANN ARBOR	MI	UNITED STATES	John Chadwick Brenner,Yu Leo Lei,NOURI  NEAMATI	DCP	ZHONG  Chen	3799975	>=$1M	2516200	25-Sep-2019	24-Sep-2019	31-Aug-2024	RFA-CA-19-014	Moonshot
project	1U01DK124165-01	U01DK124165	9928257	2020	Characterizing and predicting colitis in immune checkpoint blockade-treated cancer patients	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY  The first combination immunotherapy of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) approved for melanoma in 2015 has achieved longer progression-free survival compared to nivolumab alone (11.5 vs. 6.9 months), with 53% of patients still alive at 4 years, of whom 71% remain treatment free. Yet, safety is the biggest barrier to broader implementation of this successful combination, due to much greater occurrence of serious immune-related adverse events (irAEs) compared to nivolumab alone. In particular, immune-related colitis (irColitis) is the most common occurrence, with 10-15% of patients developing it upon receiving anti- CTLA-4 alone or in combinations. Such irColitis is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment with high- dose steroids or biologics such as anti-TNF, as well as ipilimumab or immunotherapy discontinuation. These safety concerns have hampered the development of CTLA-4 targeting agents and may have reduced their efficacy due to lower recommended dosing in combination therapy and limited treatment course. There is therefore an urgent need to comprehensively study the nature of irColitis and find whether potential risk factors could be identified and mitigated for greater safety and efficacy of combination treatments.  We have assembled a unique team of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) scientists and clinicians, tumor immunologists, microbiome specialists, and medical oncologists specializing in immunotherapy of melanoma to analyze colorectal tissue lesions, the gut microbiome, and peripheral blood biomarkers that could predict or contribute to development of irColitis. By comparing what we already learned from studying biospecimens of IBD patients, i.e., their genetic subsets at the single cell level, gut microbiome, and predictive immune signatures, we aim to characterize the transcriptomic, immunopathologic, serologic, and gut microbiome landscape of irColitis and leverage this knowledge for better therapeutic options.  We will address irColitis by characterizing gut biopsies of melanoma patients during treatment using single- cell RNA sequencing and multiplex immunohistochemistry mapping, and we will relate immune subsets and markers discovered to those found in IBD lesions. We will also measure peripheral blood serologic markers (anti-microbial and anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies by ELISA, soluble cytokine and protein analytes with Olink proximity extension assay) that we recently found to be risk factors detectable prior to development of IBD, and analyze them for their capacity to predict irColitis. From stool collected before and throughout treatment, we will analyze by 16S and metagenomic sequencing the gut microbiome of melanoma patients with or without irColitis to compare it to known colitogenic structure in IBD, and functionally assess bacterial communities in gnotobiotic models. Finally, we will integrate our findings to establish a mechanistic model of irColitis compared to IBD, to propose novel stratifications of cancer immunotherapy patients by risk factors, and to offer future therapeutic opportunities, such as actionable tissue genomic and protein targets or fecal transplants.	16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Address;Antibodies;Autoantibodies;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;CTLA4 blockade;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials Design;Colitis;Colorectal;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Crohn&apos;s disease;Data;Development;Disease remission;Dose;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Feces;Flowers;Future;Genetic;Genomics;Gnotobiotic;Goals;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immunohistochemistry;Immunologist;Immunotherapy;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Intestines;Knowledge;Lamina Propria;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical Oncologist;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibodies;Nature;Nivolumab;Patient risk;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Predictive Value;Progression-Free Survivals;Proteins;Proteomics;Risk Factors;Safety;Scientist;Serological;Serum;Serum Markers;Specialist;Specimen;Steroids;Stratification;Structure;Symptoms;TNF gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Treatment Side Effects;Ulcerative Colitis;anti-CTLA4;anti-PD-1;antimicrobial;bacterial community;base;cancer immunotherapy;clinical development;cytokine;density;fecal transplantation;frontier;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;immune checkpoint;immune checkpoint blockade;immune-related adverse events;improved;melanoma;metagenomic sequencing;microbial;microbiome;microbiome analysis;microbiome composition;novel;patient subsets;peripheral blood;predictive marker;prospective;response;serological marker;single cell analysis;single-cell RNA sequencing;targeted agent;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions	ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Jean-Frederic  Colombel,Jeremiah James Faith,Sacha  Gnjatic	DCB	Terez  Shea-Donohue	594873	$500k to $749k	397393	1-Jun-2020	1-Jun-2020	31-May-2025	RFA-CA-19-044	Moonshot

Reasons for the greater burden of aggressive disease in AA men are unknown, but are likely to include a multitude of factors including social factors such as lifetime stress, inherited susceptibility, and tumor-related features such as somatic alterations and local inflammation in the microenvironment. The overarching goal of this Program Project is to uncover the social and biological factors that are related to PCa aggressiveness in AA men. To accomplish this objective, we will establish a large, national, population-based cohort study, RESPOND, (Research on Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry: Defining the Roles of Genetics, Immunity and Social Stress) of 10,000 AA men with incident PCa identified through nine SEER and NPCR U.S. cancer registries from states that include 38% of all AA PCa cases in the U.S.. The cohort will provide comprehensive information on multilevel stressors over the lifecourse such as discrimination, early-life adversity, and neighborhood disorder, including geospatial neighborhood data over time and degree of perceived stress; 2) lifestyle factors and health behaviors; 3) disease-specific factors including PSA screening history and treatment choice; 4) germline DNA to study genetic susceptibility, and 5) tumor block samples for characterization of somatic variation and immune profiling of the tumor microenvironment. No previous study has attempted to obtain information across these domains in a single large sample in order to understand the relative contribution of each and relationships between molecular and non-genetic components. In order to address these goals, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and clinicians with established track records in PCa research. Leveraging the RESPOND resource and investigator expertise, we have designed a Program Project composed of four Projects that are supported by four Cores which are all focused on the central theme of identifying social and biological factors related to PCa disease aggressiveness in AA men. These Projects include: the investigation of multilevel social stressors across the lifecourse in relationship with aggressive PCa (Project 1); genome-wide discovery efforts of germline susceptibility loci for aggressive PCa and examination of the relationship between germline and somatic variation (Project 2); the identification of underlying somatic alterations in PCa tumors and biological pathways that are related to aggressive disease (Project 3); and, a detailed assessment of inflammation in the tumor microenvironment as it relates to PCa aggressiveness in AA men (Project 4). Each of the four Projects address a distinct research domain, however, when studied together, create scientific synergy and a far more comprehensive picture of the major factors that contribute to aggressive PCa in AA men. The information we will discover is likely to have immediate clinical implications in the areas of improved patient stratification and personalized medicine. Hence, this study has broad reaching significance and addresses numerous challenges in the clinical management of PCa in AA men.

Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 “Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME” was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central “hub” for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.

project	1U24CA224067-01	U24CA224067	9446207	2017	Data Coordination Center for PDX Net	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are a powerful model system for assessing drug efficacy of anti-cancer agents and understanding molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. However, results from individual research groups have been difficult to validate due to the lack of standardized PDX procedures, lack of scale for adequately powered PDX studies and the inability to efficiently share PDX specimens. A key contributor to this challenge is the lack of well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of integrated, standardized datasets from PDX models. The JAX-Seven Bridges PDX Data Commons and Coordination Center (PDCCC) seeks to address this challenge and unite the efforts of the component data- generating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI’s Patient-Derived Model Repository/PDMR) parts of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research Network (PDXNet) into a cohesive, trans-Network whole. Using innovative cloud computing and bioinformatic approaches, our PDCCC will provide administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX method standardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. We will build a data storage, sharing, and analysis platform that harmonizes PDXNet data with other large datasets and analysis workflows available in the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud. Simultaneously, we will administer planning meetings, training activities, and research pilots to build synergies within the PDXNet, enhancing the ability of the PDXNet to develop clinical trials from PDX studies. Our Specific Aims are to 1) establish a leadership and administration unit to manage and coordinate activities within PDXNet, including annual meetings, regular conference calls, training activities, trans-Network pilot projects, and outreach; 2) develop a cloud- integrated PDXnet Data Commons that integrates PDXNet data with the existing cloud-based data analysis platform - the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC); and 3) build analysis workflows and data sharing practices to optimize PDXNet research and enable PDXNet data to facilitate clinical trial design. To accomplish these Aims we have assembled a team with unique expertise in PDXs, cancer treatment, genomic analysis, data coordination, and project management from The Jackson Laboratory and Seven Bridges. Our combined institutional strengths include a history of leadership in (and commitment) to PDX, data resource, analytic and consensus standards development and application; practical expertise in PDX model sharing and collaborative community efforts; a broad array of statistical, bioinformatic, and software-related PDX resources; leadership expertise in large-scale, cloud-based biomedical data projects, notably the SB-CGC; and deep experience in high-performance database engineering and development. Our goal is to build an innovative, systematically organized PDCCC that will advance the efforts of PDXNet to improve the validity—and expand use—of the PDX system as a preclinical platform for precision oncology.

project	1U24CA224122-01	U24CA224122	9449147	2017	Coordinating Center for Canine Immunotherapy Trials and Correlative Studies	Grant	The primary mission of goal of the Pre-medical Cancer Immunotherapy Network for Canine Trials (PRECINCT) is to facilitate the performance of immunotherapy clinical trials in dogs with cancer and to expedite the identification of immunological correlates of successful therapeutic responses. The PRECINCT will achieve these goal by supporting a highly coordinated clinical trials network of participating U01 sites. As a coordinating center, the PRECINCT will work in consultation with U01 investigators, the Steering Committee, representatives from the Comparative Oncology Program (COP) at NCI and an External Advisory Committee to provide expert services in project management and research technology, data management, biostatistical support and immunological monitoring. Specifically, we will establish a PRECINCT Data Coordinating Center to provide comprehensive project oversight, supervise all project management and regulatory compliance activities, and coordinate site management for all aspects of single and large multi-site projects. Through the PRECINCT, U01 investigators will have ready access to research services and standardized protocols that will facilitate the performance of clinical research across the PRECINCT. We will establish a PRECINCT Data Management System to collect, store and share all clinical and correlative data amongst the U01 sites and with the COP directors and Steering Committee. We will develop the infrastructure necessary to achieve an efficient, highly functioning coordinated network and develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) that can be applied across all PRECINCT-associated U01 projects to ensure high quality, repeatable data sets. We will provide biostatistical support for study design and data analysis to ensure that immunotherapy clinical trials performed within the network are strategically designed and appropriately powered to achieve meaningful clinical and laboratory data results in the most expedite way. The renowned expertise of the University of Pennsylvania in both human and canine clinical trials will foster rapid translation of state-of-the art methods for human clinical study design and analysis to canine clinical trials and results from canine trials can rapidly inform human clinical trials, thus optimizing results for both species. Finally, the University of Pennsylvania is a leader in cancer immunotherapy and is also home to world renowned experts in immune reagent development and immunological monitoring. We will leverage this expertise to both accelerate the mission of the U24 and extend it by providing support for immunologic reagent development for use in correlative studies and biomarker identification. In concert with U01 investigators, the COP and the Steering Committee, we will design, generate and validate several multiparametric, multicolor flow panels and SOPs for their use across the U01 sites. Successful immunologic monitoring will allow canine cancer patients to be streamlined to single or combination therapies most likely to be effective and will provide essential insight for future translational application to human cancer patients.

project	1U24CA224285-01	U24CA224285	9455402	2017	Translational Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (TCIMAC)	Grant	ABSTRACT Advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various cancers. Immunotherapeutic approaches are becoming the new treatment modality in some cancer types. However, clinical efficacy is still limited to a marginal number of patients due to a newly developing understanding of the complex tumor microenvironment and a limited ability to appropriately select patients who have specific biomarker signatures and have the potential to optimally respond to specific immunotherapy or combination strategies. An additional challenge in assessment of biomarkers that show clinical utility to predict patient benefit includes the use of different methodologies and platforms that make it difficult to make accurate conclusions on the biomarkers in question. Thus, optimized biomarker strategies that can overcome immune barriers will allow tailoring of the therapeutic approaches and result in bold interventions that would be most beneficial to individual patients. The National Cancer Moonshot was launched in 2016 with the goal of boldly combating cancer beyond incremental advances leading to the creation of a “Cancer Immunotherapy Translational Science Network” that would facilitate translational research and clinical advances in immunotherapy.  Our proposal to create a resource center, named Translational Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (TCIMAC) that will be a critical resource capable of serving any of the NCI-supported clinical trial networks. The TCIMAC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba, renowned cancer surgical and molecular pathologist, Elizabeth Mittendorf, well-known breast cancer surgeon and immunologist, and Chantale Bernatchez, cancer immunologist. They will be supported by a team that encompasses a multidisciplinary group of world-class and highly collaborative experts on cancer and immunotherapy. The main goals of TCIMAC are to: 1) provide centralized and harmonized services for sample collection, processing and quality assurance, and 2) use analytically-validated and standardized assays and platforms to offer state-of-the-art analyses for patients enrolled on NCI- sponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will assist in standardizing bio-banking activities and share/develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing, quality assessment, and storage of biospecimens collected from NCI-sponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials and to link the specimens to relevant clinical, pathological, immune and molecular data within the TCIMAC-CIDC Network. In Aim 2, we will provide services to conduct both routine and innovative pathological, immunological and molecular analyses using standardized and validated assays to aid the completion of NCI- sponsored trials. In Aim 3, we will provide comprehensive biostatistics and computational services for data collection and analysis for each analytical platform, and to perform analyses, interpretation and predictive modeling of high dimensional (`omic”) data in the context of clinical outcomes. We envision that the TCIMAC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress in cancer immunotherapeutic approaches.

project	1U24CA224316-01	U24CA224316	9456997	2017	Cancer Immunologic Data Commons	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer immunotherapies have emerged as highly promising approaches to treat cancer patients, particularly since they can be applied across different tissue and cancer types, although clinical efficacy has been limited to a subset of cancer patients. Translational studies with strong focus on biomarkers are critical to understanding the tumor-immune interface. Although numerous technologies for tumor and immune profiling are applied to NCI sponsored immunotherapy trials, standardization of both assay protocols and data analysis methods is crucial to data integration and comparisons across studies for biomarker identification. This underlines the need for data harmonization and creation of uniform analysis pipelines. We propose to establish the Cancer Immunology Data Commons (CIDC) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with the goal of advancing translational research efforts using biomarkers to aid in the further development of cancer immunotherapy. The short-term objectives of this application are to establish and manage the data repository for biomarkers and associated clinical data for Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers (CIMACs), and provide an informatics environment for integrative multi- dimensional analysis across different studies and storage of data generated. Specifically, we propose to: Aim 1, coordinate with the CIMAC and Laboratory Coordinating Committee (LCC) to harmonize establish assay protocols and data format standards; Aim 2, develop a centralized data repository and management system, and coordinate CIMAC data submission to the CIDC; Aim 3, develop uniform bioinformatics processing pipelines and computing infrastructure for computationally intensive analyses for the CIMACs and the larger research community; Aim 4, provide bioinformatics algorithms to enable integrative and correlative analysis of CIMAC data and integrate other accessible databases and resources for biomarker discovery; Aim 5, develop centralized role-based data access functions with advanced programming interface to enable sharing of CIMAC data; Aim 6, develop interactive web visualization functions to enable investigators and the immunology communities to examine the CIMAC data; and Aim 7, coordinate within the CIMACs-CIDC Network logistic and scientific activities for biomarker discovery and validation. At the conclusion, we will have established a biomarker repository for all data and results generated by CIMACs, supplemented with standardized informatics tools for integration with other accessible databases, and compatible for data contribution and secondary analyses by external researchers. These efforts will provide bioinformatics support for the CIMACs-CIDC Network. The established Data Commons will also provide the foundation for a future immuno-oncology data resource for the larger research community.

project	1U24CA224319-01	U24CA224319	9457012	2017	High-Dimensional Immune Monitoring of NCI-Supported Immunotherapy Trials	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Immunotherapy is transforming decades of clinical practice in cancer care, but it also comes with new questions about understanding mechanisms of action contributing to both antitumor activity and potential associated toxicity. Most importantly, identifying why only a fraction of patients derives clinical benefit is at the forefront of future developments, with the ever-elusive validation of useful clinical biomarkers as the ultimate goal. As a consortium of immunologists, technologists, clinicians, computational biologists, data specialists, and biostatisticians, the Mount Sinai CIMAC (MS-CIMAC) is uniquely positioned to generate immune profiling datasets at an unprecedented level of granularity to identify biomarker signatures of disease course and response to immunotherapy in cancer patients. MS-CIMAC will take full advantage of the smart cancer immunotherapy trial designs championed by the NCI that mandate collection of baseline and on-treatment biospecimens. Key strengths of MS-CIMAC are expected to be in unique high-dimensional yet sample-sparing approaches, including CyTOF mass cytometry, seromics, microbiome, and multiplex chromogen IHC, thanks to the implementation of cutting-edge yet validated protocols and analysis pipelines. Through a comprehensive array of assays and analytical tools that bridge innovation and standardization, MS-CIMAC intends to pursue the following three aims: a) help characterize immunocompetence at baseline and assess global immune changes during treatment, b) drill down the specificity and quality of immune responses for mechanistic evaluation of drugs, and c) automate, optimize, and integrate analyses of resulting datasets to facilitate sharing, and to ultimately discover composite immune biomarkers that will impact clinical cancer care.

project	1U24CA224331-01	U24CA224331	9457104	2017	Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center	Grant	Summary The critical role of the immune system in effecting anti-tumor responses to traditional and molecularly-targeted therapies is increasingly recognized, such that there is now an explosion of activity in the clinical investigation of immuno-oncology. In parallel, we have gained great advances in our ability to extract useful biologic information from patient material through the development of: (i) high-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing, that has uncovered major genetic determinants of clinically-evident immune responses; (ii) highly multiplexed biological assays, that have revealed the complex interplay between immunity and cancer in relation to therapy; and (iii) advanced computational methods, that have enabled large-scale integrative data analysis. Underlying this activity is a need to identify the critical biomarkers of response and resistance to therapy in each disease and across diseases. With the rapidly evolving clinical and experimental developments in immunotherapy occurring across all major academic centers, the need to build a coordinated infrastructure for data collection, processing and analysis has emerged as a high priority. At Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), the Center of Immuno-Oncology (CIO) was established several years ago and is a local hub of translational immuno-oncology activity. As a part of its mission, the CIO supports dedicated translational biomarker laboratories to provide expertise in the analysis of immune correlatives in the service of immuno-oncology trials. Collectively, these resources provide multidisciplinary capabilities supporting both investigator-initiated and externally-sponsored studies ranging from clinical trial design, the performance of well-validated immune monitoring capabilities on patient samples during trials, the interpretation of data from immune monitoring testing, and the development of novel assays based on the scientific questions motivated by individual clinical studies. We propose to expand the laboratory and biostatistical capabilities of the CIO along with those of additional DFCI units as a Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC). We want to coordinate the efforts of the proposed DFCI-CIMAC with other CIMACs and with the Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) to develop the standards for designing studies rich with immune correlatives and informative for candidate biomarkers, to be tested in future trials. Aim 1 focuses on harmonizing the technical aspects of assays offered by the CIMACs; Aim 2 focuses on the assay-specific scoring analyses and reporting of CIMAC offerings. Modeled on our long history of implementing standard and innovative assays to study DFCI phase I/II trials, we describe a process for using `Tier 1' `shovel-ready' assays that we expect as standard components of an immune monitoring tool-kit and `Tier 2' assays that are tailored to the specific needs of a study (Aim 3). Altogether, these efforts fall within the concept and vision of personalized medicine for immuno-oncology because only by the analyses of large well-annotated datasets can we identify links between biology, molecular markers and clinical response.

Utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach, we will support Immuno-Oncology Translation Network (IOTN)-funded components to discover new immune targets and evaluate novel immune- based therapies and combination approaches that eliminate established cancers in adults or to prevent cancers before they occur. Our DMRC strategy is to serve as an administrative and analytic hub at every step of the IOTN's translational studies, focusing to reduce the barrier for access to analytic expertise, improve the productivity of IOTN investigators, maintain a high standard for data collection and management, design and perform rigorous analytical strategies, and foster a collaborative and supportive research community. An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: First, we will provide a centralized administration infrastructure to coordinate IOTN activities, building upon the NRG Oncology Statistical and Data Coordinating Center's experience of coordinating over 450 translational cancer studies across hundreds of participating sites. Second, we will provide multidisciplinary analytic expertise to support IOTN collaborative research, leveraging five of RPCI CCSG's shared resources: Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, Biomedical Data Science, Data Bank and BioRepository, and Immune Analysis. Our analytic support will be armed with professional IT staff and informed by an experienced IO researcher team. Third, we will develop innovative data integration methods to enhance IOTN research capacity, capitalizing on the well-respected Bioconductor project and the independent research programs of the RPCI department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics. Fourth, we will actively promote the IOTN and engage in trans-consortium interactions, where we will leverage Bioconductor's decade-long experience in community engagement and the NRG data center's rich expertise in project coordination. Leveraging our active NCI-funded RPCI-committed resource to support the proposed multi-institutional trans-disciplinary IO research is not only cost-effective, but also flexible in its study-dependent scalability. Taken together, we envision that our DMRC, in close collaboration with the IOTN, will allow us to conduct highly effective and innovative translational studies to address the significantly unmet clinical needs related to IO.

As the CC, RTI will provide leadership, scientific expertise, and logistical support to unite RCs into a cohesive research group that will provide actionable evidence based on implementation science principles to improve symptom management across the cancer treatment continuum (i.e., treatment with curative intent, treatment with noncurative/palliative intent, cancer survivorship) and address the unique challenges of minority and medically underserved populations. Specifically, we will (1) enhance research efficiency, productivity, and impact by facilitating collaboration and providing the logistical, communications, and operational support necessary to run a multicenter research Consortium; (2) facilitate the development of evidence-based symptom management recommendations by establishing processes for harmonized data collection, the use of common data elements, and the application of consistent procedures across studies and research sites; and (3) accelerate adoption of integrated systems for monitoring and managing patient-reported symptoms by developing and applying analytic approaches to IMPACT pooled data and collaborating with RCs and other stakeholder to broadly disseminate findings. This application has specific strengths that will enhance the scientific productivity of the Consortium: (1) Under the leadership of Dr. Barbara Kroner, the CC will foster collaboration within the IMPACT Consortium by uniting diverse researchers around shared goals and harmonized studies to advance the research agenda. (2) RTI will promote effective communication by developing custom web-based tools for communications, document sharing, and online trainings; establishing and leading SC working groups in topics relevant to IMPACT (e.g., Health Disparities; Implementation Science; Data Management, Statistics, and Informatics). (3) RTI will use a common implementation framework (i.e., Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)) combined with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research) to concurrently evaluate multilevel factors that can influence clinical practice by assessing both effectiveness and implementation outcomes. (4) RTI will leverage data standards and harmonization across the Consortium to catalyze data sharing and aggregation. (5) RTI will advocate for a Stakeholder Advisory Group to guide and inform pooled study design, data collection, analyses, and interpretation of study findings. (6) RTI will combine the harmonized data with planned pooled analyses which will yield optimal management system models for implementing integrated systems into routine clinical practice and use implementation science approaches to accelerate adoption of integrated systems and sustain changes in clinical practice.

Development of the Cellular Immunotherapy Data Resource (CIDR) will leverage the CIBMTR infrastructure for database development, data sharing, networking with participating centers, and clinical research in cellular therapy for the treatment of cancer. Additionally, innovative approaches to optimize capture of long-term follow-up data from recipients of genetically modified cells will be explored, such as utilization of electronic patient-reported outcome tools. Providing access to high quality data for research is among the main goals of the CIDR. The proposed project employs a variety of methods to promote use of the resource, including access to prepared datasets, reports and publications, rapid response to requests for custom datasets, and a system to evaluate and prioritize requests for statistical support. The latter will be provided by statisticians with deep expertise in survival analysis. Finally, collaboration with multiple stakeholders, including professional societies, accreditation bodies, industry, treating centers, and investigators representing multiple areas of oncology, hematology, cell processing, and immunology will optimize utilization of the CIDR resource and advance the rapidly emerging field of cellular immunotherapy.

As the CC, RTI will provide scientific expertise and logistical support to create a cohesive research group that will develop the evidence base to increase CRC screening, diagnosis, and referral-to-care among populations who currently have low rates of screening. Specifically, we will (1) enhance productivity of ACCSIS Program members and stakeholders by providing necessary logistical, communications, and operational support; (2) support the generation of the evidence base on multilevel interventions to increase CRC screening by establishing common data elements and harmonized data collection procedures across research projects; (3) identify and support locally-developed innovative approaches to accelerate the evaluation of additional promising interventions to increase CRC screening; and (4) generate a user-friendly data repository and disseminate program findings to facilitate the adaption and scale-up of successful interventions. RTI has specific strengths that will enhance the scientific productivity of the program, including the following six. (1) We will use previously tested procedures and policies, based on our experience as the CC for more than 35 multisite projects, to enhance coordination among ACCSIS studies. (2) Our team, led by Dr. Sujha Subramanian, has more than a decade of experience in CRC screening studies, and will be supported by a multidisciplinary team of experts in implementation science, heath systems and community clinical linkages, heath disparities, multisite data collection, biostatistics, ethics and health data regulations, web design, data repository management, and dissemination. (3) We will enhance existing frameworks for common data collection that we have developed through our partnership with more than 40 CRC implementation programs by expanding the frameworks to include moderators and mediators. Expansion will allow us to understand the underlying pathways at each level of the intervention (patient, provider, and organization or community). (4) We will draw upon our ready-built network of CRC stakeholders to incorporate lessons learned from prior implementation studies and to identify locally-developed innovative approaches. (5) We will leverage internal expertise in implementation science methods and conduct mixed analysis using both quantitative and qualitative data to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cross- site findings from the multilevel interventions. (6) We will combine our leadership in communication science methods with our award-winning multimedia team to deliver an evidence-based branding strategy and dissemination plan to increase the visibility and reach of the ACCSIS Program.

We will provide key services to organize and support the Research Centers that comprise this network, and foster a community based on collaboration, transparency, and sharing. Our primary scientific objective is to accelerate the discovery of mechanisms governing tumorigenesis, progression, and evolution, which will lead to improved prevention and treatment strategies for patients. We aim to achieve this by providing technology services coupled with best practices to expedite data acquisition and dissemination to HTAN researchers, as well as the broader scientific community. Computational pipelines will be developed and shared to enable data harmonization, and analytic tools and visualizations will be hosted on cBioPortal to facilitate data access and analysis for a wide spectrum of users ranging from data scientists and statisticians to biologists and clinicians. We will also host crowd-sourced challenges to engage researchers outside of HTAN to address important scientific questions.

project	1U24CA252977-01	U24CA252977	10048476	2020	Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS): Coordinating Center	Grant	Abstract Cancer genomics aims to improve our understanding and treatment of all cancers by identifying differences in DNA sequence and gene expression between tumor cells and normal host cells. Cancer genomics has contributed to many advances in treating several cancers, but the field is limited by a lack of genomics data. The Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network will promote and support research on direct participant engagement approaches to address these gaps, especially among rare cancers, highly lethal cancers, cancers with an early age of onset, cancers with high disparities in incidence/mortality, and cancers among under-represented minorities.  Our team wishes to contribute to the important work of the (PE-CGS) Network by serving as its coordinating center. We have the necessary faculty, resources, and experience to address the needs and goals of the Network by supporting network coordination, promoting effective and equitable outreach and promotion, and establishing and disseminating network best practices. In addition to meeting all the requirements of the RFA, we bring innovation by establishing Participant Engagement Community (PEC) by applying the principles of community-based participatory research and by promoting a diverse pool of future scientists, especially those from underrepresented groups through a Summer Scholar Program and by two post-doctoral positions that will be supported by our comprehensive cancer center.  Our proposal for the coordinating center is focused around four specific aims. First, we will effectively manage administrative and scientific coordination of the PE-CGS network. This will include providing administration/coordination, governing all advisory, organizing meetings/site visits, fostering collaboration, dissemination and implementation, and coordinating communication. Second, we will foster effective and culturally appropriate outreach and promotion activities. We will establish a common branded, public relations, communication resources, facilitating interactions, and managing outreach. Third, we will develop and disseminate network best practices and data collection/processing standards. We provide support for participant engagement and cancer genome sequencing activities, establish data standards, ensure data are accessible to the public, data are appropriately shared, and support efforts to make the Network sustainable. Finally, we want to address health disparities and promote equity throughout the Network and ensure there is a diverse pool of future scientists, including those from underrepresented groups, to support future efforts in participant engagement and cancer genomics. We envision that the network will need to evolve to address emerging issues in participant engagement and believe that being based in a university setting will provide us the capacity to anticipate and address these issues as they emerge. We are strongly supported by the OSU College of Medicine, the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the OSU Center for Clinical and Translational Science.

project	1U2CCA233195-01	U2CCA233195	9626781	2018	The Cellular Geography of Therapeutic Resistance in Cancer	Grant	Most patients who die from cancer do so because their cancer is resistant to available therapies, either intrinsically, or as it evolves in response to treatment. However, the fundamental mechanisms driving resistance remain largely unknown. Tumors are comprised of a complex multicellular ecosystem of malignant and non- malignant cells, and changes in their composition, states, spatial organization and interactions are central to therapeutic resistance. Thus, there is an enormous need to chart an atlas of a tumor's cells, their spatial organization and interactions as those change dynamically in resistance to therapy. Technological breakthroughs in spatial and single-cell genomics, including many innovations by our team, now put an atlas within reach, but harnessing this remarkable opportunity, requires collection of multiple spatial and single cell genomics data in clinical samples; novel study design strategies; new experimental and computational strategies to integrate across cellular and spatial data; algorithms to construct tumor atlases that capture the resistant state; and showing how to use an atlas to formulate and test new predictive models of resistance. The Boston Human Tumor Atlas Network Research Center (HTA-RC) will address each of these challenges by creating three comprehensive atlases of the cellular geography of human cancer to understand how changes in the tumor ecosystem lead to therapeutic resistance in: (1) Primary and acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition in breast cancer; (2) Primary and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic melanoma; and (3) Primary resistance to immunotherapy in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinoma (CRC) compared with microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC. All three tumors types tackle an unmet clinical need; have an approximately equal rate of resistance and response to allow comparisons between states; and harness significant clinical experience and build on substantial preliminary results at our center. To construct the atlases, we will collect at least 100 biospecimens per year from resections and biopsies of the three tumor types and analyze them with histopathological data, high-resolution spatial multiplex RNA and protein data, single- cell genomics data, and temporal clinical data. Our algorithms will recover key features of each data modality, and integrate them into a single atlas to determine what predicts and underlies resistance. We build on a well-established interdisciplinary team in two major cancer centers (DFCI, MGH) and four research institutions (Broad, Harvard, Stanford, Princeton). Our leadership (Haining, Regev) and Units comprise of foremost experts and pioneers in clinical genomics (Biospecimens; Johnson, Wagle), spatial and single cell genomics (Shalek, Rozenblatt-Rosen, Nolan, Zhuang), and computational biology and data science (Regev, Van Allen, Engelhardt). Our atlases will allow identification of predictive biomarkers of resistance in the tumor ecosystem, and therapeutic target discovery, targeting diverse facets of the complex tumor ecosystem.

project	1U2CCA233238-01	U2CCA233238	9627274	2018	The Lung PCA: A Multi-Dimensional Atlas of Pulmonary Premalignancy	Grant	Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide chiefly due to our inability to detect the disease at its earliest stage and the lack of interventions to prevent its development in those at highest risk. The rate-limiting step to developing new approaches for lung cancer detection and prevention is our lack of understanding of the earliest molecular and cellular changes associated with lung carcinogenesis. We propose to develop a high-resolution, multidimensional genetic, molecular, and cellular atlas of pre-cancerous lung lesions and their surrounding microenvironment for lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, the two most common subtypes of lung cancer. We will leverage unique retrospective and prospective cohorts assembled at multiple medical centers via our Biospecimen Unit to collect, annotate, and process premalignant lesion biospecimens of the lung and airway. Our Characterization Unit will apply existing and emerging molecular profiling tools to characterize the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic landscape of these lesions. Pipelines for standardized multidimensional data processing, quality control, analysis and integration will be developed by our Data Analysis Unit, leading to creation of a web-based portal for data dissemination and online integrative analysis to benefit the greater research community. Cross-sectional sampling of premalignant squamous and adenomatous lesions adjacent to early stage cancer will enable development of a spatial map that will provide insights into the evolution of premalignant cells and their microenvironment. Our longitudinal study of airway premalignant squamous lesions that progress toward or regress away from invasive carcinoma will provide both a temporal and spatial map of the molecular determinants of invasive carcinoma. We will also leverage this longitudinal study to demonstrate the clinical utility of our Lung Pre- Cancer Atlas through development of prognostic biomarkers of premalignant progression that can be applied clinically for precision management, as well as to stratify patients with aggressive premalignant squamous lesions into early-phase intervention trials. Successful completion of the Atlas will be accelerated by: (1) a highly-coordinated Administrative Core that will facilitate interactions within and across Units, as well as the exchange of data, methods, and tools with other centers within the HTAN; and (2) partnerships with ongoing NCI, foundation, and industry lung premalignancy initiatives. Our Lung Pre-Cancer Atlas will ultimately serve as a resource for the medical and scientific communities to enable the development of biomarkers for early detection and risk stratification, as well as identification of novel targets for therapies that will intercept the development of lung cancer.

project	1U2CCA233254-01	U2CCA233254	9627374	2018	Breast Pre-Cancer Atlas Center	Grant	ABSTRACT – Overall Development of invasive breast cancer may frequently progress through a preinvasive precursor called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). DCIS is an extremely common clinical diagnosis that is essentially a disease of screening triggered by the detection of abnormal breast calcifications on mammography. Before the advent of mammography, DCIS was an incidental and relatively uncommon finding. Over 60,000 women in the United States will be presented with this diagnosis each year with relatively weak evidence-based guidance for disease management which ranges from active surveillance to bilateral mastectomy. We propose to compile multi-dimensional and multi-scale information on DCIS to construct a Pre-Cancer Atlas that can be used to better understand the disease but also to better stratify risk of progression, a useful translational endpoint. To do this, we have assembled a team of investigators with deep and complementary clinical, experimental, and quantitative expertise and experience with DCIS and breast cancer in general. Further, we conduct these studies with full consideration of tumor evolution and ecology as it pertains to precancer development and progression. Specific aspects of the proposed Atlas construction include: 1) Several types of DCIS cohorts that will capture spatial and longitudinal information including a prospective clinical trial cohort undergoing active surveillance, 2) Analyses designed to maintain relevant spatial organization of the disease for evolutionary and Atlas building considerations based on 3) Radiologic-histologic-cellular-molecular registration approaches, 4) Characterization at multiple scales including whole tumor, single duct and single cell levels, 5) Characterization of relevant parameters including mutations, copy number changes, methylation, gene expression, and microenvironmental elements including inflammatory cell profiles. 6) Incorporation of the breast cancer intrinsic subtype paradigm into the analytic phase, and 7) Layered, spatial, and longitudinal data visualization. Overall, this work will provide a comprehensive platform to guide the next generation of studies on DCIS and other precancers.

project	1U2CCA233262-01	U2CCA233262	9627416	2018	Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center)	Grant	SUMMARY-ABSTRACT  The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre- malignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre- melanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to myeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as shaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the Center for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary technical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision prevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the molecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk individuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials. This will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex tissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.  Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination with HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with three subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists and a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological specimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository will provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in prospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an oncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high- plex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate reagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications. Aim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to manage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most technically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each in preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm development. The resulting human browsable and machine-readable atlases are expected to yield new scientific discoveries, demonstrate the feasibility and utility of new technologies and help to reduce the incidence of life-threatening cancers of the skin and blood.

project	1U2CCA233280-01	U2CCA233280	9627504	2018	Omic and Multidimensional Spatial Atlas of Metastatic Breast and Prostate Cancers	Grant	ABSTRACT - Overall We propose to create an Omic and Multidimensional Spatial (OMS) Atlas that will enable discovery of mechanisms of resistance that arise in individual patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancer during treatment with current generation targeted therapeutic combinations and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The OMS Atlas is motivated by the fact that these treatments typically are only transiently effective in the metastatic setting. Possible resistance mechanisms may be intrinsic to the tumor cells or derive from the diverse microenvironments in which the tumor cells live. The OMS Atlas will focus on elucidating these resistance mechanisms in three specific current generation clinical scenarios: (a) hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, (b) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and (c) castration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) undergoing treatment with enzalutamide. We will accomplish this through work in four areas. A Biospecimen Unit will prospectively collect, manage, and distribute longitudinal clinical information, blood, and biopsies from 20 patients from each of two metastatic breast cancer cohorts and one prostate cancer cohort that will be analyzed to create three OMS Atlases. The biopsies will be preserved to enable analyses using multiple characterization modalities. A Characterization Unit will analyze (a) OCT frozen specimens using Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) and Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing ATAC- seq (sci-ATAC-seq) to elucidate spatially defined genomic changes and chromatin accessibility in single cells, (b) formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to assess the immune microenvironment and cyclic Immunofluorescence (cycIF) to assess the composition and molecular states of tumor cells and their microenvironments, and (c) paraformaldehyde fixed, resin embedded (PFRE) specimens using a Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM) to identify ultrastructural changes in 2D images and targeted 3D images with 4-nm resolution. Omic characterization of the same tumor samples will be provided by the SMMART Program. A Data Analysis Unit will develop and deploy tools to (a) manage, analyze, and visualize Tier 1 data comprised of raw sequence data and images to generate unimodal Tier 2 results, (b) integrate omics and imaging data through crosswise mapping to create single timepoint tumor maps and quantify systems biological functions of tumor cellular subpopulations to generate Tier 3 results, and (c) explore differences between pre- and on/post-treatment tumor maps to reveal mechanisms of resistance that comprise Tier 4 results. We will collaborate with private sector partners to evaluate and adopt next generation technologies that increase analytical power and speed and reduce costs. The Administrative Unit will facilitate the coordination, operation, interaction, and evaluation of activities within the OMS Atlas and between OMS Atlas scientists and the HTAN.

project	1U2CCA233284-01	U2CCA233284	9627522	2018	Transition to Metastatic State: Lung Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer and Brain Metastasis	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall Unit) Metastasis embodies the dynamic, complex, whole-organism pathophysiology of cancer. Spread of cancer cells beyond the primary tumor site is the cause of the majority of cancer deaths and the most overt expression of cancer's complex evolutionary dynamics. Intimately related to the intricate processes of development and immunity, the transition from locally invasive to metastatic cancer poses a major scientific hurdle. Recent technological and computational advancements, pioneered by our team enable dynamic, multi-dimensional, multi-planar analysis of multiple tissues. Applying these advances to the most lethal cancers in the US: Lung Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer and CNS metastases, we will generate a Human Tissue Atlas with unprecedented spatial-temporal resolution. This multidisciplinary effort begins with an unparalleled array of human tissues and clinical data acquired by our Biospecimen Unit team. These high-quality biospecimens will be obtained from lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and CNS metastases obtained from surgical resections, biopsy or autopsy. The Data Analysis Unit will then subject these specimens will be subjected to multi-dimensional analysis including bulk DNA sequencing, single cell and single nuclear RNA sequencing, as well as architecturally- sensitive analyses including MIBI (protein) and MERFISH (RNA) technologies. Driven by revolutionary computational and systems biologists, integration and presentation of these datasets will be undertaken by the Characterization Unit, with the goal of generating authoritative human tumor atlases of value to the entire cancer research community.

project	1U2CCA233285-01	U2CCA233285	9627531	2018	Center for pediatric tumor cell atlas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL Childhood Cancer is the second most common causes of childhood deaths. Cancers in children are highly distinct from those in adults. Causes, mechanisms and therapeutic approaches cannot be extrapolated from the study of adult malignancies. To impact the burden of pediatric cancers requires the specific study of pediatric cancers. We therefore propose the in depth characterization of three specific subtypes of pediatric malignancies which, together, account for over 50% of all pediatric cancer deaths: high grade glioma (pHGG), high risk neuroblastoma (NB), and very high risk acute lymphoblastic B-cell precursor leukemia (VHR-ALL). All three tumor types share a characteristic of typically initial response to therapy, followed by the emergence of resistance and refractory disease. We will map molecular and cellular changes in tumor cells, microenvironment and the immune system using comprehensive multi-dimensional single-cell and in situ technologies associated with two critical transitions: initial response, and emergence of resistant disease – both high-priority transitions. Treatment modalities will include standard chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-) T cell therapy, capturing the cutting edge of current cancer therapy. The final product will impact global childhood cancer research in the following manner: 1) Tumor Atlases: atlases will provide a highly user friendly, publicly available, searchable database of the most comprehensive multi-omic, single cell analysis of the three most lethal childhood cancers. Molecular data will be richly annotated with access to additional pathological evaluation, clinical and outcomes data, and grant access to source data such tumor imaging. 2) Computational methods: in addition to the data, the critical computational tools and pipelines used in this project will be available to the research community. These include methods and pipelines for processing multi-omics and in situ data, inference of cancer phylogeny, inference of cell- and clone-specific pathways, methods for inferring cell-cell crosstalk, as well as database algorithms for the query, exploration and visualization of highly complex data. 3) Access to biospecimens for follow up studies: biospecimens collected in this project will be banked and made available to the biomedical research community. These include tissue sections, viably frozen specimen, and patient derived xenograft (PDX models). In summary, the proposed project will seek to address a major public health need in pediatrics, broadly impact the entire research community, and jumpstart target discovery based on a sophisticated understanding of the key molecular circuits that drive pediatric cancer.

project	1U2CCA233291-01	U2CCA233291	9627573	2018	Integrative Single-Cell Atlas of Host and Microenvironment in Colorectal Neoplastic Transformation	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top three most prevalent cancers in global incidence and mortality. Most of these cancers develop from pre-cancerous adenomas. Colonoscopy is currently the most effective CRC prevention strategy. However, colonoscopy may fail to prevent carcinoma in as many as 24% of cases, is less effective at preventing proximal CRCs, is expensive for health care systems to implement, carries economic and psychosocial burdens for patients, and can be complicated by bleeding, perforation, and other adverse events. There is an unmet need to develop new preventive strategies and risk stratification models to address these and other issues. By analysis of whole human tissue, seminal work from Bert Vogelstein and co-workers demonstrated that CRC develops from an accumulation of genetic events as tumors evolve from small to large adenomas and, eventually, to cancers. More recently, our group reported the first comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of CRC, which also was from a bulk analysis of whole tissue Despite this wealth of data on CRC, we believe that the ability to provide the most effective precision diagnostics and preventive strategies can only be achieved with single-cell analysis. Through such a single-cell analysis, we propose to map spatial relationships across the spectrum of normal colon, early polyps, and late adenomas, including their unique stromal and microbial microenvironments. Aim 1: To construct a pre-cancer atlas of colorectal adenoma progression that depicts the spatial landscape of the tumor ecosystem, including the stroma and biofilm-associated microbiome, using single-cell (sc)RNA-seq, whole exome sequencing, multiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), and species-specific bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Aim 2: To integrate the activities and data from the Biospecimen, Tissue Characterization and Data Analysis Units for the prospective standardized collection and analysis of colorectal tissue, associated biospecimens, and related clinical and epidemiological data from 1,800 participants undergoing colonoscopy or surgical resection. Aim 3: To disseminate the pre-cancer atlas, related biospecimens, primary data sets and analytical tools to the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), the broader scientific community, and the lay public. To accomplish these aims, we have assembled a highly interactive and established team of investigators with complementary expertise (epidemiologists, gastroenterologists, pathologists, surgeons, systems biologists, bioinformaticians, cancer biologists, immunologists, and biofilms/infectious disease experts). To further optimize our novel methodologies for application to the prospectively collected samples from 1,800 atlas participants, we will leverage our existing large repository of colorectal adenomas and supporting biospecimens, generated and curated through an ongoing epidemiological project through 3 cycles of the Vanderbilt GI Special Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE). We are confident that our application, in toto, is greater than the sum of its parts, and we look forward to robust bi-directional interactions with HTAN.

project	1U2CCA233303-01	U2CCA233303	9627644	2018	Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract: Overall Diverse areas of cancer research have progressed to the point that it is now feasible to meaningfully integrate research data and clinical information across the molecular, cellular, and tissue realms into a larger, more detailed picture of the onco-dynamics of cancer, including spatial-temporal details during cancer treatment and progression. Physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the Siteman Cancer Center (WUSM-SCC) are longtime leaders in the allied sub-disciplines of cancer, including genomics, proteomics, imaging, functional characterization, pathology, clinical trials, and clinical care. WUSM- SCC is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, which sees ~9,000 new cancer patients annually. Building on our expertise, established infrastructure, large patient population, and extraordinary institutional commitment, we propose to develop the Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center (WU- HTARC) within the NIH Human Tumor Analysis Network (HTAN). We will focus on generating organ-specific human tumor atlases for three high priority cancer types associated with exceptionally poor prognosis: the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), glioblastoma (GBM), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Collectively, we will analyze ~1,600-2000 samples collected from spatially separated locations and at different time points along the clinical treatment course from 300-375 patients (selected from ~750 recruited patients) for the duration of the project. In addition to standard histopathological analyses, bulk DNA/RNA sequencing, proteomics, and clinical imaging, etc., we will conduct cutting-edge, comprehensive analyses, including single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), multiplexed immunofluorescent protein localization (MxIF), mass cytometry/Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF) cellular characterization, metabolomics analysis, innovative imaging, and 3-D modeling. We have established infrastructure covering the aforementioned areas, from specimen procurement (Biospecimen Unit), to multidisciplinary analyses modules (Characterization Unit), and to analysis pipelines (Data Analysis Unit). Data generated from this study will be valuable for revealing the clonal evolution of the tumor cells from longitudinally collected specimens and to reconstruct the tumor ecosystem involving non- cancer cells and acellular structures. Our atlases will have comprehensive data integration at the 3D level over time, providing unprecedented 4D models for the 3 selected cancer types. Our established infrastructure and continuous efforts in incorporating new technologies in omics, imaging, and informatics, will help ensure our atlases will be the state-of-the-art, taking full advantage of the latest progress in these fields and will continue to evolve beyond the pilot phase to facilitate cancer research and improve clinical care. The proposed atlases target a set of critically important clinical questions, including tumor resistance that has long been a challenge for GBM treatment and also an important clinical problem in BRCA/TNBC and PDAC, in which minority populations are disproportionately affected. Other emphases are BRCA response/resistance to chemotherapy, PDAC metastasis, and GBM local recurrence in conjunction with resistance to therapy. These atlases can cross reference each other for pan-cancer analyses. We will also seek to cooperate with any Pre- Cancer Atlas (PCA) centers studying these disease types to maximize the temporal continuity of research on these cancers. The similarities and differences among the three selected cancer types will provide synergy among the three atlases and will also allow us to accumulate valuable knowledge in atlas building for other cancer types. The data, specimens, and experience gained by our center will be shared with HTAN and the broader research community to foster the next important discoveries in personalized cancer medicine.	3-Dimensional;Affect;Anatomy;Archives;Area;Atlases;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;Cancer Biology;Cancer Center;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cataloging;Catalogs;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Clonal Evolution;Clonality;Collaborations;Communities;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Cytometry;DNA;Data;Data Analyses;Data Set;Dimensions;Discipline;Disease;Drug resistance;Ecosystem;Ensure;Evolution;FAIR principles;Fostering;Foundations;Future;Generations;Genes;Genome;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Goals;Histopathology;Human;Image;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Individual;Institutes;Knowledge;Link;Location;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medicine;Methodology;Minority;Modeling;Molecular;Mutate;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organ;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathology;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Physicians;Pilot Projects;Population;Positron-Emission Tomography;Process;Proteins;Proteome;Proteomics;Recurrence;Reporting;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resistance;Sampling;Series;Site;Slice;Solid Neoplasm;Spatial Distribution;Specimen;Structure;Time;Tissues;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Validation;Washington;anticancer research;biomarker discovery;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell type;chemotherapy;clinical application;clinical care;clinical imaging;cohesion;data integration;density;drug development;exome sequencing;experience;genome sequencing;imaging informatics;improved;in vivo;innovation;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;malignant breast neoplasm;medical schools;metabolome;metabolomics;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;new technology;new therapeutic target;outcome forecast;patient population;relational database;response;single-cell RNA sequencing;synergism;therapeutic development;therapy resistant;three dimensional structure;tool;transcriptome sequencing;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor progression;whole genome	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	SAINT LOUIS	MO	UNITED STATES	Samuel  Achilefu,Li  Ding,Ryan C Fields,William E.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a hereditary colon cancer syndrome, is also caused by mutations in APC and affects children as young as 7 years of age. FAP causes hundreds of colonic polyps in affected individuals and a 100% lifetime risk of CRC. In preliminary efforts we have successfully collected hundreds of pre-cancerous colon polyps from individual FAP patients, applied genomic, epigenomic and other multi-omic analyses and begun to elucidate the impact of multiple types of “omic” alterations on precancerous colon polyp evolution toward CRC. We propose to use an integrated and collaborative approach to develop a PreCancer Atlas for colorectal adenocarcinoma using FAP as the disease model. We will: 1) Establish a biospecimen collection pipeline for procurement of longitudinal tissue samples during surveillance colonoscopy and during prophylactic surgical colectomy, including whole blood, serum, normal colonic tissue, colon microbiome, benign pre-cancerous polyps, dysplastic precancerous polyps and colon adenocarcinomas. The material will be used for our own center and will also be available to the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN). Medical records, longitudinal samples and all relevant metadata will also be collected. 2) Establish a center to characterize the tissue samples with state-of-the-art omics and imaging technologies. These include but are not limited to whole genome sequencing, methylation, transcriptome, proteome, cytokine, metabolome, microbiome, and molecular imaging. 3) Establish an analysis core that analyzes and integrates results from -omics, imaging and medical information, builds a spatiotemporal, multidimensional, integrative multi-omics cancer atlas, and develops longitudinal and predictive models for PreCancer biology and progression, as well as data portal and visualization framework. 4) Establish multi-omics technologies on smaller number of samples. 5) Perform a “multiscale deep data analysis” on a large number of samples (57) from a few people and a fewer number of samples (6) from many people. Use this information to guide additional data collection. 6) Identify factors (e.g. germline genetics, microbiome, immune dysfunction) contributing to polyp heterogeneity between and across individuals. Build disease progression models based on these data. 7) Make all biospecimens, information, protocols and software available to the PCA, HTAN and the general scientific community. We expect our efforts will greatly facilitate understanding CRC at its earliest stages and serve as a model for understanding precancerous lesions of other solid tumor malignancies.	7 year old;APC gene;Adenocarcinoma;Adenomatous Polyposis Coli;Affect;Atlases;Automobile Driving;Benign;Biological Models;Biology;Cancer Etiology;Cause of Death;Cessation of life;Child;Colectomy;Collection;Colon Adenocarcinoma;Colon Carcinoma;Colonic Polyps;Colonoscopy;Colorectal Adenocarcinoma;Colorectal Cancer;Colorectal Polyp;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease model;Epigenetic Process;Event;Evolution;Family;Gene Mutation;Genetic;Genomics;Health;Heterogeneity;Human;Image;Imaging technology;Immune System Diseases;Individual;Inherited;Integration Host Factors;Lead;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical;Medical Records;Metabolic;Metadata;Methylation;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Normal tissue morphology;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Pilot Projects;Polyps;Precancerous Polyp;Premalignant;Prevention strategy;Proteome;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Research Personnel;Sampling;Serum;Solid Neoplasm;Syndrome;System;Technology;Therapeutic;Tissue Sample;Tissues;United States;Whole Blood;base;collaborative approach;colon microbiome;colorectal cancer risk;cytokine;data portal;data visualization;epigenomics;experience;genome sequencing;lifetime risk;metabolome;microbiome;molecular imaging;multiple omics;novel;novel strategies;predictive modeling;prophylactic;spatiotemporal;transcriptome;treatment strategy;tumor;whole genome	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	STANFORD	CA	UNITED STATES	JAMES M.

project	1U2CCA252971-01A1	U2CCA252971	10294884	2021	USC PE-GCS: Optimizing Engagement of Hispanic Colorectal Cancer Patients in Cancer Genomic Characterization Studies	Grant	ABSTRACT Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. Hispanic/Latinos are the largest and fasting growing ethnic group in the US, and cancer is the leading cause of death among H/L in the US. Therefore, we need to fully understand the full complexity of the molecular etiology of cancer in this ethnic group. For instance, although incidence rates of CRC are lower among Latinos as compared to Whites or African Americans, Hispanics with metastatic disease have shorter overall survival when adjusted for health care setting, demographics, disease characteristics and treatment factors. H/L also tend to be diagnosed at a younger age and with higher stage, and we have previously reported that Mexican H/L in California have the greatest proportion of young (<50 years of age) diagnoses compared to other H/L subgroups. Moreover, Mexican H/L showed higher prevalence of rectal cancer cases compared to other H/L and NHW. Although socio-economics and access to care might influence these differences, we need to take a complete look at the biology of disease in this ethnic group to determine once and for all if these clinical differences are related to differences in molecular etiology. The Cancer Genome Atlas has provided a deep overview of the molecular taxonomy of CRC in 594 cases, however, less than 1% of the cases (n=5) were H/L. Therefore, it is imperative for us to take more detailed assessment of the molecular genomic landscape of CRC in H/L. One of the major issues likely limiting our ability to perform these large genomic initiatives in minority patients is that Patient or Participant Engagement practices may not been investigated to identify best practices for accruing and consenting patients into clinical translational biomedical research studies. This concept of Participant Engagement is critically important for both the patients and the translational cancer research community. Optimizing and improving our approaches for directly engaging patients at initial contact, throughout the course of a translational genomic study, and during the time of return of results is likely to lead to stronger relationships between the medical community and patients, but could also lead to significant improvement in outcomes for patients and for the cancer care community as a whole. As such, we propose the creation of the USC Center for Optimization of Participant Engagement in Cancer Characterization (COPECC) with a focus on optimizing the engagement of Latinos in CRC Genomic Characterization research studies. USC COPECC would serve as a member of the NCI U2C Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network. Our investigative team includes experts in all relevant areas of research for genomic characterization, participant engagement, and engagement optimization. We have an established platform for consenting patients into cancer genomics studies that will serve as a standard process. The overall goal of USC COPECC is to generate results on participant engagement optimization and CRC genomic research that will be shared with the broader community to distribute best practices for engaging Latinos in hopes of improving overall outcomes for CRC in this underserved population.

project	1U2CCA252973-01	U2CCA252973	10048641	2020	Engagement of American Indians of Southwestern Tribal Nations in Cancer Genome Sequencing	Grant	While American Indian (AI) Tribes and communities are highly diverse in ethnicity, language, and culture, there is one unfortunate characteristic that they share: profound cancer health disparities. Compounded by disproportionately low rates of cancer screening and more limited access to healthcare, AI are more often diagnosed at later stages of disease and have the poorest outcomes in all types of cancer when compared to any other racial and ethnic group in the United States. The cause of these significant cancer health disparities is undoubtedly multifactorial. However, an unexplored factor is the molecular characterization of tumors arising in AI. American Indians and Alaska Natives (AN) have been strikingly understudied in The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) and account for only < 0.5% of the cancer patients studied. Of the nearly 11,000 patients sequenced in TCGA to date, only 27 (0.25%) were identified as AI/AN. It is our hypothesis that through appropriate participant and community engagement and comprehensive genomic sequencing, we will discover novel somatic and germline mutations, differences in the spectrum and/or frequency of cancer-promoting mutations, and genome-wide mutational signatures reflective of behaviors and exposures, that can ultimately be translated to improved cancer screening, precision prevention, and therapeutic intervention in American Indian participants and communities. In this application, we will focus on the molecular characterization of cancers which show significant disparities in AI of the Southwest, including gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary cancers (stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, liver, gallbladder and biliary tree); genitourinary cancers (kidney, prostate cancer); and other hormone-dependent cancers (breast, ovarian cancers). Our Specific Aims are to develop culturally-appropriate, respectful, and trusted means to: 1) Engage American Indian participants (cancer patients and survivors) and their Tribal communities in participatory research studies of the molecular characterization of cancer, particularly focusing on cancers that display striking disparities in incidence and outcome in Southwest Tribal Nations; 2) Discover novel somatic and germline mutations and/or differences in the spectrum and frequency of cancer-promoting mutations, and genome-wide mutational signatures reflective of specific behaviors and exposures, in American Indian participants, relative to other racial and ethnic populations in the U.S. and the world; 3) Disseminate knowledge gained through these studies to Tribal participants and Tribal Councils, leaders, stakeholders, and communities using unique means of participant engagement and novel means of communication, such as visual arts and media, that are sensitive to cultural and religious beliefs and practices and that acknowledge the indigenous languages and dialects, many of which lack many scientific and medical terms for words and concepts such as cancer, gene, genomics, mutation, and DNA, and 4) (Share knowledge with the broader scientific community through the NCI Genome Data Commons and publication of scientific results in accordance with NIH Data Sharing Policies and Tribal Agreements.

project	1U2CCA252974-01	U2CCA252974	10048560	2020	Count Me In: Partnering with patients to define the clinical and genomic landscape of rare aggressive sarcomas in children and adults	Grant	Osteosarcoma (OS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) are exceedingly rare cancers, both subtypes of sarcoma, that arise in bone and smooth muscle respectively. There has been a failure to improve survival rates or decrease treatment-related morbidity in OS/LMS due to insufficient characterization of the genomic landscape, resulting in a lack of targeted therapeutic approaches, diagnostic methods, and preventive strategies. There is an urgent need for a large, shared database of clinical and genomic data in OS and LMS. Yet, because of the rarity of these tumor types as well as other challenges in patient recruitment and the genomic characterization of these tumors, to date it has been difficult to generate this data. The overarching goal of this proposal is to engage adult and pediatric participants with OS and LMS as partners to generate a shared database of clinical, genomic, molecular, and patient-reported data. This should accelerate discoveries that drive novel treatment strategies, new clinical trials, and new standards of care. The Count Me In PE-CGS U2C Research Center will leverage our experience in patient engagement, genome characterization, computational analysis, and behavioral research to create and launch two patient-partnered projects to generate this clinicogenomic data. We will build two websites with patients in the OS and LMS communities—the Osteosarcoma Project (OSproject) and the Leiomyosarcoma Project (LMSproject)—and consent 3,000 patients over the course of the study. We will collect medical records, patient-reported data, archival tumor tissue samples, and saliva and blood for genomic analysis. We will generate clinically annotated genomic data from at least 750 tumor specimens, 500 circulating tumor DNA specimens, and corresponding germline specimens and share the de-identified data widely. At the same time, we will study and optimize the approach to patient engagement in cancer research, particularly among rural and minority participants and participants across a range of literacy levels, ages, and stages in development. To accomplish these goals, we will build on a well-established interdisciplinary team from the Broad Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with members who have pioneered these approaches. Our leadership (Wagle, Janeway) and Units are comprised of experts in patient-partnered cancer research (Wagle, Painter), sarcoma clinical and translational research (Janeway, George, Crompton, Raut), genome characterization, analysis, and clinical interpretation (Gabriel, Getz, Van Allen, Wagle, Janeway), computational biology/data science (Getz, Van Allen, Philippakis), and behavioral science (Mack, Rebbeck). Our Center will uncover the key clinicogenomic features of OS/LMS, integrate them into a single comprehensive database with a goal of accelerating research and improving the lives of these patients. In doing so, we also aim to present a general approach to patient-partnered research that can be disseminated broadly and applied to other tumors types and patient communities.

The optimal clinical management for LGG remains unknown. A comprehensive genomic characterization of the evolution from primary LGG to recurrence is required to begin to address the LGG knowledge gap; optimizing the engagement of LGG patients in this effort is critical to the success of this process. Using our International Low Grade Glioma Registry as a starting point, we will construct a community of 700 LGG patients who have undergone surgical resection at time of diagnosis and at time of recurrence and want to participate in research. We will use both hospital-based as well as web- and social media-based patient engagement efforts and adapt pre-existing resources developed at Yale including HUGO PHR, a secure cloud-based personal health record platform that allows secure and permission-based movement of data bi-directionally between patients and researchers and ARCHETYP, a Yale-developed software that assists patients in the location of clinical trials. We hypothesize that LGG patient engagement and satisfaction (and thus overall participation) in genomic characterization studies will be improved by 1) the ability to obtain and share medical record data with researchers, 2) the availability of bi-directional communication between study and patients regarding study focus, progress, outcomes as well as patient specific results, 3) improved messaging and education regarding study and patient goals with respect to genomic characterization of patient materials. We also propose that the knowledge gained in this application will provide a significant improvement in the care of LGG patients.

project	1U2CCA252981-01A1	U2CCA252981	10294012	2021	Washington University Participant Engagement and Cancer Genomic Sequencing Center (WU-PE-CGS)	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Vision. Participant engagement and sequencing research from the Washington University Participant Engagement and Cancer Genomic Sequencing Center (WU-PE-CGS) will fill critical gaps in knowledge, methodology, and characterization of understudied cancer populations, leading to optimal approaches to participant engagement, outreach, and communication in genomic characterization studies. Goal. The overall goal of the WU-PE-CGS is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for approaches direct engagement of cancer patients and post-treatment cancer survivors as participants in cancer research. Our focus is on rare and understudied cancer populations with significant disparities including cholangiocarcinoma, multiple myeloma, and colorectal cancer under age 50. Participant engagement strategies are most effective when they are adapted and implemented in real-world settings in partnership with community and patient advocacy stakeholders. Setting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration, catalyzes new ideas in patient engagement, and ensures support for patient engagement and genome sequencing that finds solutions for complex recruitment and engagement challenges in real-world settings with underrepresented patient populations. Significant matching contributions from Washington University will allow us to quickly and strategically invest in ideas. Aims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) Advance the field of participant engagement to study cancer disparities and rare cancers by conducting innovative and impactful direct stakeholder engagement with continuous evaluation and research; (2) Expand an exceptional, diverse team of investigators, patients, and advocacy stakeholders; (3) Address cancer disparities by understanding barriers to and improving the ability for disadvantaged and understudied populations to encounter, use, and benefit from genomic sequencing and analysis; (4) Organize and integrate Center units to facilitate transdisciplinary, team science within our Center and across the PE-CGS Network. Innovations and impact. The WU-PE-CGS builds on a long and outstanding record of leadership in both cancer disparities and genomic research across the cancer continuum. We will be particularly innovative and allow for a significant return on the scientific investment in several ways. First, our Center has distinctive features that include a combined focus on cancer disparities, the application of strategies to increase participant engagement in research, success in biospecimen acquisition, and exceptional genomic sequencing expertise. Second, we have assembled a diverse, world class team with strong linkages to multiple rare and understudied cancers. Third, we engage investigators from different disciplines and invest in the development of early career scholars. Fourth, we will strategically and creatively disseminate products in ways that will benefit researchers, practitioners, and community members. Fifth, we will partner with exceptional patient-centered and wide-reaching advocacy groups to engage patients, optimize recruitment, and seamlessly return results. Input from these groups, patients, and their families is a key strength that will leverage our track record of stakeholder-engaged research. And finally, we have developed a focused strategy for collective integration of our units. These synergies will allow our Center to become a national resource for optimal approaches to participant engagement, outreach, and communication in genomic characterization studies and other studies as technologies advance that will accelerate progress for both the scientific community, patients and their communities.  In summary, we are uniquely situated to advance a network of participant engagement and sequencing researchers, integrate research with patients and their stakeholders, build intellectual capital, and significantly enhance the capacity for participant engagement and genomic characterization studies. This Center will ultimately benefit health systems, providers, and people with rare cancers and lead to a reduction in cancer disparities.

project	1U54CA209978-01A1	U54CA209978	9350520	2017	Combating Subclonal Evolution of Resistant Cancer Phenotypes	Grant	Overall abstract Our Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution) will develop a suite of systems-based methodologies to understand how genomic diversity, clonal evolution, and phenotypic change  . To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer	Address;Behavior;Biological Models;Biological Pharmacology;Biological Process;Breast;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Clonal Evolution;Clonality;Collection;Communities;Community Outreach;Complex;DNA;Data;Development;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;Education and Outreach;Educational Activities;Evolution;Faculty;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Heterogeneity;Individual;Institutes;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mathematics;Measures;Methodology;Modeling;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Ovarian;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Pharmacology Study;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Population Dynamics;Population Heterogeneity;Postdoctoral Fellow;Prevention program;Refractory;Regimen;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Science;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid;Somatic Mutation;System;Systems Analysis;Systems Biology;Testing;Therapeutic;Translations;Variant;base;cancer cell;cohort;combat;computerized tools;data sharing;dynamic system;effective therapy;experimental study;improved;innovation;knowledge base;malignant breast neoplasm;member;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel drug combination;outreach program;personalized cancer therapy;predictive modeling;pressure;prevent;programs;student training;synergism;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tool;transcriptomics;treatment response;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment	UNIVERSITY OF UTAH	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	UNITED STATES	ANDREA Hope BILD	DCB	Shannon K Hughes	474644	$250k to $499k	474644	9-May-2017	15-May-2017	30-Sep-2017	RFA-CA-15-014	Moonshot

Despite improvements in the clinical outcomes achieved with newer therapies, wide inter-individual variation in response to treatment is a major limitation in achieving consistent therapeutic effects, or cures. Not all patients respond to initial therapies (innate resistance), and those that do frequently relapse with refractory disease (acquired resistance). The central hypothesis we are addressing is that rational therapeutic development in MM should be based on an understanding of the underlying genetics and biology of the tumor that identify sensitivity and resistance to current and future drugs. In this Myeloma-DRSC we are proposing 3 Projects that will: 1) develop a high throughput drug screening platform for myeloma cell lines representing the wide diversity of MM biology; and use this platform to screen primary patient tumor cells for most effective responses, including combination therapies; 2) develop a comprehensive mutational and germline variation panel that will be correlated to drug responses in vitro and in vivo, as well as toxicities; 3) identify the mechanism of response and resistance for two of the most common therapeutics used in MM treatment: IMiDS and proteasome inhibitors; 4) develop genetic and immunophenotypic signatures that effectively predict tumor response, resistance, and patient toxicities; 5) identify tumor sub-populations that may contribute to emerging resistance; and 6) identify strategies to predict drug resistance and approaches to overcome resistance.

Treatment strategies for AML have not changed in 30-40 years. Single-agent targeted therapies based on AML genetics or microenvironmental disease features have been disappointing, at best. The investigators on this DRSC Program, Drug Combinations to Circumvent Resistance (D2CR), have collaborated for over a decade and have developed functional genomic pipelines for evaluation of primary AML patient samples that have collectively led to numerous discoveries with diagnostic and therapeutic implications. For this Program, our long-term goals are to translate effective drug combinations that target tumor- intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways into the clinic for patients with AML. Our immediate goals are to prioritize the most relevant tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways for each AML disease subset and establish sufficient preclinical data to facilitate immediate clinical investigation of drug combinations. Based on the central hypothesis that drug combinations targeting tumor intrinsic and extrinsic features of AML biology will be essential to the development of more effective and durable therapeutic strategies, we predict that the drug combinations established by this D2CR-DRSC Program will substantially improve outcomes for patients with AML. To accomplish these goals, 3 Projects are proposed: 1) What are the tumor-intrinsic genes and pathways that contribute to drug sensitivity and resistance? Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screens on parental and drug-resistant AML cells will be integrated with computational analysis of the largest functional genomic AML cohort in the world. The result will nominate genes/pathways for validation on patient samples in gene-edited models and for drug combination studies in Project 3. 2) What are the tumor-extrinsic pathways promoting tumor cell growth, drug resistance, and immune suppression? Inflammatory cytokine profiling of our large bank of AML patient samples will be conducted. Our bank of AML patient bone marrow stromal cells will also be accessed for studies of the reactive signature of these stromal cells when exposed to specific drugs. Finally, high-parameter immunophenotyping and T-cell functional assays will be used to define the immune landscape with candidate drugs tested in an immune-competent, spontaneous mouse model of AML. Candidate targets will be nominated for combination studies with tumor-intrinsic targets. 3) What are the drug combinations that most effectively bridge tumor- intrinsic and microenvironmental biology to eliminate AML cells and circumvent resistance? Drug combinations from targets nominated in Project 1 and 2 will be tested ex vivo on primary AML patient samples and in vivo using AML patient-derived xenografts. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a major impact on our understanding of AML biology, with successful clinical translation of new, more effective drug combination strategies.

project	1U54CA224065-01	U54CA224065	9446059	2017	University of Texas PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	SUMMARY Our overarching goal for the University Texas PDX Development and Trial Center (UTPDTC) is to optimize personalized biomarker-based cancer therapy and identify effective targeted drugs based on the molecular characteristics of each tumor. Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly- annotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The primary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single agents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs or combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets of tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other histologies. Over the past 9 years, both University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDACC) and The University of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) have established institution-wide efforts to generate novel PDX models and perform preclinical testing. Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX models of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases where there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We have characterized many tumor subtypes in our existing PDXs and plan to characterize many more with the ultimate goal of developing drug combinations in defined tumor subsets in a context that can lead to clinical trials which will validate the experimental results. We plan to focus on NCI-IND agents that are primarily used by the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network. The availability of hundreds of PDXs of diverse histologic types and molecular profiles provides a unique opportunity for synergistic interactions among the UTPDTC investigators, PDXNet, and ETCTN. Each Project will identify molecular subtypes and then test with drugs targeted to putative pathways. Similar molecular subtype profiles will be identified across projects and histologic classifications. This provides an opportunity to test the activity of drugs targeting specific molecular pathways that may be active in several histologically distinct subtypes. Such pan-histologic activity could greatly accelerate drug development. Our proposed studies focus on targeted therapeutic agents for treatment of diseases and/or molecular subtypes that have unmet medical needs. The proposed studies are highly relevant to public health, as their success will lead to effective precision therapy for cancers, for which current therapies are ineffective.

project	1U54CA224068-01	U54CA224068	9446211	2017	An integrated translational approach to overcome drug resistance	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL) Drug resistance represents one of the most critical obstacles to clinical benefit for cancer patients. Due to the size and complexity of this challenge, we believe a collaborative team approach is critical and have assembled a team of drug resistance experts from three leading institutions (MGH, the Broad Institute, and MIT/Koch Institute) with an exceptional track record of impactful discoveries in this field. We propose an integrated full- spectrum translational platform—including liquid biopsy, patient-derived tumor models, exome and transcriptome sequencing of tumor tissue, rapid autopsy, functional genomic screens, innovative preclinical mouse models, and a high-throughput combination drug-screening platform covering the CTEP portfolio—to address critical principles of drug resistance across several major cancer types—lung, melanoma and GI cancers, which impact a large percentage of cancer patients. Overall, these three projects will focus on the common theme of bypass resistance mechanisms, a critical ad frequent mechanism of therapeutic resistance that can involve both genetic and adaptive resistance mechanisms that “bypass” the effects of therapy, and which can drive both intrinsic and acquired resistance. To maximize the potential impact on cancer patients we will focus projects on three major tumor types—lung, melanoma and GI cancers—with each project integrating at least two tumor types. We will focus our projects on defining and overcoming key bypass resistance mechanisms to three of the most critical classes of cancer therapeutics: MAPK inhibitors, RTK inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. While each project will focus on a specific therapy and at least two specific cancer types, we believe the overall program design can be readily applied to additional agents and molecularly-defined cancers, such that the ultimate impact of this work will go beyond the specific studies proposed and will serve as a “blueprint” for critical discoveries related to drug resistance. We anticipate that these efforts will define a new standard in our mechanistic understanding of bypass resistance mechanisms and will lead to novel opportunities to overcome them in the clinic. Our proposed approach will provide a steady stream of novel therapeutic strategies involving CTEP agents and pathways for evaluation in future clinical trials, as well as new potential agents for the CTEP portfolio. We have also integrated cutting-edge strategies for real-time blood-based monitoring of response and resistance to help guide innovative trial design.

project	1U54CA224070-01	U54CA224070	9446221	2017	Rational approaches to melanoma therapy	Grant	Project Summary – Overall The outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma have improved dramatically over the last decade due to an improved understanding of the molecular drivers of this disease. In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens have been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas. These treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof- of-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will progress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been shown to be effective in patients with a wild-type BRAF. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments that prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are effective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies, over the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical, histological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of >450 PDX models represents one of the largest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately recapituluates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also includes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been maintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a robust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we propose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued expansion of our robutst melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical gaps in this disease. Project 1 will characterize kinase inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the PI3K-AKT pathway in combination with approved targeted therapies in PDX models in treatment-naïve and drug- resistant BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanomas. Project 2 will characterize targeting the apoptotic machinery of cancer cells as a combinatorial approach with MAPK pathway inhibitors in PDX with and without BRAFV600E/K mutations, including in subsets with aberrancies in anti-apoptotic genes. Both Projects will utilize baseline characteristics of the PDX models to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to guide personalized patient selection for future clinical testing. In addition, tumors will be analyzed for treatment-induced effects that correlate with sensitivity to identified resistance mechanisms and potential new combinatorial strategies. Finally, markers identified in the preclinical models will be compared to parallel biomarker studies of metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in clinical trials utilizing the same agents. These studies will be supported by the PDX, Bioinformatics, and Administrative Cores to ensure their success, along with a Pilot Project program to open new areas of investigation. Together these studies will have high potential to translate into new personalized clinical trials for patients. 1	Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Area;BRAF gene;Bioinformatics;Biologic Characteristic;Biological Markers;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program;Cell Line;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collection;Cutaneous Melanoma;DNA;DNA Damage;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Drug resistance;Enrollment;Ensure;FDA approved;Fine needle aspiration biopsy;Foundations;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Heterogeneity;Heterogeneity;Histologic;Human;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immunodeficient Mouse;Immunotherapeutic agent;Institution;Investigation;Laboratories;Lesion;MAP Kinase Gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Melanoma Cell;Metastatic Melanoma;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Patient Selection;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Pilot Projects;Pre-Clinical Model;Property;Proteins;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;RNA;Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases;Regimen;Relapse;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Resources;Selection for Treatments;Signal Transduction;Solid;Specimen;Subgroup;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Translating;Tumor stage;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;cancer cell;combinatorial;disease heterogeneity;effective therapy;established cell line;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;kinase inhibitor;melanoma;multidisciplinary;mutant;novel drug combination;novel marker;novel therapeutic intervention;patient subsets;personalized medicine;personalized therapeutic;potential biomarker;prevent;programs;research clinical testing;resistance mechanism;response;success;targeted treatment;tool;tumor;tumor progression	WISTAR INSTITUTE	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	Michael  Davies,Meenhard F Herlyn	DCTD	Jeffrey Arnold Moscow	2885586	>=$1M	2885586	25-Sep-2017	30-Sep-2017	31-Aug-2019	RFA-CA-17-003	Moonshot
project	1U54CA224076-01	U54CA224076	9446429	2017	PDX Trial Center for Breast Cancer Therapy	Grant	Project Summary The scientific premise of this Center is that breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models represent the diversity of human breast tumors, and can be feasibly utilized to test new drugs and drug combinations to find therapeutic approaches that match with molecular features of various tumor types. The goal of our PDX Development and Trials Center (PDTC) is to obtain preclinical data that will facilitate prioritization of drugs to be tested in breast cancer clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Toward this goal, our PDTC focuses on testing drugs that are already available through the NCI as NCI-IND agents with the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). Scientifically, this PDTC will focus on preclinical evaluation of approved and investigational drugs and drug combinations in a large collection of breast PDX models representing primary and metastatic breast cancer. One project will screen 35 NCI-IND drugs as single agents and in combination with standard- of-care therapies, in >100 breast PDX models using a novel organoid system, and validate these responses in PDX-bearing mice. Another project will test therapies that are predicted to target tumor- initiating cell populations, with the goal of reducing chemotherapy resistance and recurrence – the major cause of death from breast cancer. These two synergistic research projects will be supported several key Cores: a PDX Core to propagate the PDX models and run the drug studies; a Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core to identify molecular features of tumors that do (or do not) respond to various treatments; a Pilot Projects and Trans-network Activities Core to foster exploration of new ideas within the PDTC and in collaboration with the PDXNetwork (PDXNet); and an Administrative Core to facilitate effective communication within the PDTC and with the PDXNet. Taken together, these elements will converge to reveal high-priority treatment strategies for future clinical trials in breast cancer patients.

project	1U54CA224079-01	U54CA224079	9446574	2017	The MSKCC-UW/Fred Hutch Prostate Cancer Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center	Grant	OVERALL ABSTRACT The lethal stage of metastatic prostate cancer, called castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), kills ~26,000 men per year in the US. Despite remarkable improvements in survival with next generation AR pathway inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, CRPC patients ultimately progress and die from their disease. Our understanding of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to AR therapy has increased dramatically in recent years, largely based on genomic landscape analyses of tumors from CRPC patients and preclinical studies of acquired resistance in patient-derived models (organoids, PDX). Much of this progress is directly linked to the members of this Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center (DRSC) team. A major mechanistic insight from these studies is the recognition of two categories of AR therapy resistance: one in which AR pathway signaling is restored and the other in which it remains inhibited. Underlying both categories are a heterogeneous set of resistance mechanisms, many of which were discovered by our DRSC team members. Importantly, we have shown that several of these resistance mechanisms can be targeted with current clinical grade drugs. The overarching goal of this DRSC proposal is to evaluate these translational opportunities across a unique set of preclinical organoid and PDX models (again, discovered and developed by our DRSC team members) and to catalyze the initiation of clinical studies in patients most likely to benefit based on appropriate biomarker profiles. We address this goal in three Projects. Project 1 focuses on resistance caused by restored AR pathway function, which occurs in over ~50% of CRPC patients, by targeting the glucocorticoid receptor, which is upregulated and substitutes for AR, or by further inhibition of AR signaling using drugs targeting specific components of the chromatin machinery. Project 2 will take a similar approach but will focus on the opposite category of acquired resistance (absence of restored AR pathway activity), leveraging insights from our recent data showing that cancer can revert from an AR-negative to AR-positive state by targeting specific chromatin modifiers. Project 3 integrates with Projects 1 and 2 by focusing on kinase inhibitors as an adjunct to AR pathway therapy in two distinct contexts – PI3K/AKT activation in tumors with PTEN loss and FGFR activation in tumors with autocrine FGF8/FGF9 production. Excitingly, a recent clinical trial of combined AKT and AR inhibition, which was initiated based on our earlier work, demonstrated a significant improvement in survival for patients with PTEN loss prostate cancer. The Administrative Core will oversee the integration of the Projects with each other, with NCI scientific staff and with other DRSCs. Collectively our studies will validate various combination therapy regimens, in conjunction with molecular biomarkers for patient selection, as a critical step toward clinical translation. In addition, the drugs and targets studied here are broadly relevant for multiple cancer types.

project	1U54CA224081-01	U54CA224081	9446620	2017	Bay Area Team Against Resistance	Grant	PROJECT ABSTRACT The proposed Bay Area Team Against Resistance U54 Project (BATAR-UP) is an interdisciplinary effort of investigators to apply their knowledge and expertise to dissect the molecular and cellular basis of incomplete response and resistance to current treatments and to identify new treatment strategies to better neutralize or eliminate residual disease and prevent resistance. This translational approach will be part of the NCI's Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Centers Network to develop innovative strategies to understand and combat mechanisms of tumor resistance and exploit tumor sensitivity to anti-cancer therapies.  To accomplish this, BATAR-UP will support two projects and one core driven by a multidisciplinary team of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University. Project 1 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of residual disease in lung cancers treated with targeted inhibitors in clinical use. We will prioritize for initial study both EGFR-mutant and ALK gene rearrangement positive lung cancers, given their importance as key molecular disease subtypes and our prior published work and expertise. We will harness genetic and transcriptomic analysis of clinical samples (liquid and tumor biopsies) to provide a molecular view of the evolution of response, residual disease, and acquired resistance. We will generate organoid and PDX models and apply cutting-edge functional screens (genetic, pharmacologic, and targeted proteomic assays) to identify key vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited, including with CTEP agents. This systematic approach will allow us to reveal the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that drives EGFR and ALK inhibitor resistance and pinpoint therapeutic strategies to intercept the evolution of residual disease and eventual acquired resistance. Project 2 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of resistance and residual disease in lung cancers treated with current immunotherapies, including PD-1 and PD- L1 antibodies. Leveraging shared platforms in synergy with Project 1, we will perform systematic analyses of liquid and tumor biopsy specimens (and ex vivo models) obtained from patients longitudinally before and during treatment and upon acquired resistance. We will focus our studies on EGFR and ALK wild type patients, including squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma patients where immunotherapy has shown efficacy but is typically non-curative. We will leverage (1) a novel lung cancer organoid model wherein tumor biopsies are cultured as both tumor epithelium and their endogenous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) en bloc as a cohesive unit, and (2) deep droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Our systematic approach will help define the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that contributes to immunotherapy resistance and identify potential new therapeutic strategies to help convert these incomplete responses into curative outcomes. Our Administrative Core will provide leadership, coordination and oversight for BATAR-UP with the overarching goal of synergizing the research conducted in the 2 Projects and the entire DRSC network.

project	1U54CA224083-01	U54CA224083	9446705	2017	Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract: Overall With the discovery of a number of new molecular targets and exponential increase in the number of anti-cancer agents, it has become imperative to optimize preclinical models in order to design rational clinical trials. Recognizing the unique advantage of the patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) models in drug testing and personalized medicine, physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the Siteman Cancer Center have been actively generating and utilizing PDX models for cancer research and the evaluation of molecularly targeted agents. Building on our strength and existing infrastructure, we propose to establish the Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center (WU-PDTC), as part of PDXNet program, to promote preclinical testing in a collaborative nation-wide effort. The PDX core within WU-PDTC will develop and characterize at least 1000 new pathogen-free PDX models across major tumor types. The PDX models will be genomically and phenotypically characterized using the latest `omics technologies and expertly analyzed using the most current data analysis pipelines that have been deployed for other large scale NCI programs. The Bioinformatics Core will integrate these analyzes with clinical annotation from the originating patient to include patient treatment history and tumor response (Aim 1). Our two research projects will conduct PDX clinical trials using single agent and combinational agents using drugs under NCI-IND (Aim 2). Project 1 will test pan- or beta isoform specific class I PI3K inhibitors in over 100 breast PDX models while Project 2 will study combinatorial approaches that overcome tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms to ERK inhibition in over 100 already available pancreatic PDX models. Proteogenomic and clinical response data will be collected in these models, as part of a broader effort of characterizing PDX models and conducting clinical correlation and treatment response analyses by the Bioinformatics Core (Aim 3). All relevant information, including proteogenomic features of PDX models and treatment/response history, will be tracked in a dedicated relational database that will be accessible to PDXNet and PDMR-FNLCR. The goal is to identify candidates for human clinical trials for the ET-CTN. In Aim 4, the WU-PDTC will leverage existing expertise and programs from the NCI-designated Comprehensive Siteman Cancer Center, Institute of Clinical and Translational Research (ITCS), McDonnell Genome Institute, Mallinkrodt Imaging Research Center, and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN) to support the goals of developing and utilizing PDX models to test and improve cancer treatment, in collaboration with other components of the PDXNet. Finally, WU-PDTC, through coordination by the Administration Core, will support pilot research projects utilizing the PDX resources and fostering collaboration across PDTCs, PNMR-FNLCR, and other NCI programs. The goal is to increase the spectrum of agents tested in PDX clinical trials and to improve the reliability, validation, utility, and standardization of PDX models through innovative Cross-PDXNet research. Our demonstrated capability in generating and utilizing PDX models, extensive existing infrastructure, and strong institutional commitment set a solid foundation for a successful PDTC that will help achieve goals set by NCI in advancing the use of PDX models in preclinical testing.

The driving oncoprotein in ARMS is the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein, a chimeric transcription factor that hijacks normal gene expression and chromatin state. Five-year survival for children with PAX3-FOXO1- positive ARMS is ~30% for all-comers, and <10% when metastatic. Despite the discovery of PAX3-FOXO1 in 1993, treatment strategies for affected children remain unchanged. This deficiency stems equally from a lack of understanding of the basic biology of the disease and an inability to directly target the fusion protein. No systematic or comprehensive approach has been undertaken to identify the proteins and regulatory elements required to support PAX3-FOXO1-mediated tumorigenesis. As a result, the field has been limited to a patchwork of data with no unified scientific strategy. To overcome this, this FusOnC2 Center has an innovative team and dynamic environment in which data interpretation is informed by complementary technological approaches and by biological and clinical knowledge. This comprehensive approach will transform understanding of PAX3-FOXO1-mediated oncogenesis and create opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The Center’s overarching goal is to advance the therapeutic tractability of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein in ARMS by comprehensively identifying the druggable co-regulators, modulators, and intrinsic activities of PAX3-FOXO1. To accomplish this goal, the Center includes two complementary Projects, each led by expert RMS biologists paired with specialists in pioneering experimental approaches undertaking the most cutting-edge research in cancer biology, genomics, proteomics, structural biology, and medicinal chemistry. The Projects will be supported by RMS investigators within each project who will provide curated RMS cell lines, unique human primary RMS tumor cells, and murine models to enable rapid in vitro and in vivo validation and cross-prioritization of targets. An Administrative Core will integrate and coordinate the Center components, providing leadership and oversight, and promoting cross-pollination of ideas and resources. The Overall Specific Aims are to: (1) define and target the PAX3-FOXO1 interactome; and (2) perform chemical probe discovery for PAX3-FOXO1 to create additional tools for investigating the fundamental biology and tractability of PAX3-FOXO1 and fusion-positive RMS. Approaches used include proximity labeling, saturation mutagenesis, single and combinatorial CRISPR screens, high-throughput phenotypic assays, and mechanistically unbiased approaches to chemical probe discovery using novel high-throughput binding assays. We will use information gleaned to prioritize targets and agents for validation and to inform compound optimization and PROTAC preparation. This Center’s strengths and resources will synergize with the FusOnC2 Consortium, speeding development of knowledge generalizable to the biology of multiple fusion oncoproteins in childhood cancers, accelerating advances in clinical care.

project	1U54CA231637-01	U54CA231637	9600132	2018	The Center for Therapeutic Targeting of EWS-oncoproteins	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall The primary scientific focus of this Center is to understand the molecular underpinnings of EWS-ETS driven Ewing sarcoma and to investigate novel treatments and therapeutic mechanisms to improve outcomes for pediatric patients with this aggressive disease. Translation of molecular understanding of sarcoma pathophysiology into effective new drugs in the clinic is a complex, risky proposition that requires the coordinated efforts of a talented team of individuals with complementary skills. This group brings expertise in Ewing sarcoma biology and the EWS-ETS oncoproteins, epigenetics and transcription, structural biology, computational biology, chemical biology and drug development, mouse models, preclinical experimental therapeutics, and clinical trials development. A Center mechanism is essential to the success of this proposal. No one institution nor individual can bring mastery of the diversity of approaches, technologies, and scientific domains needed to achieve the goals of this proposal. We have elected to focus on understanding the fundamental inner workings of Ewing sarcoma from its transcriptional circuits, to the direct protein interactions with EWS-FLI1, to the direct and immediate effects of EWS-FLI1 degradation. Moreover, a strong emphasis of this proposal is on target identification and preclinical validation, critical steps in the process of bringing forward therapies with optimal chances for success in the clinic. The team that is assembled has all of the component pieces needed for success. Our Center includes outstanding basic cancer biologists, chemists, computational biologists, and translational researchers, and five pediatric oncologists. Thus, the proposed Center can catalyze basic discovery and clinical translation by leveraging basic and clinical research talent within the Center and our strong ties to outside academic and industrial partners.

This Center’s mission is tightly aligned with that of the larger Consortium on Fusion Oncoproteins in Childhood Cancers and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative. A major impetus for the development of this Consortium has been the growing knowledge that fusion oncoproteins that are pathognomonic for specific cancer types often function via disruption of the structure and/or activity of protein complexes that govern chromatin architecture and hence gene control. We have shown that at least two of the fusion oncoproteins highlighted as major areas of emphasis within the Consortium, SS18-SSX and EWS-FLI1, bind and act via BAF complexes to drive cancer-specific oncogenic gene expression. Importantly, genetic studies across human cancer types have indicated that genes encoding encoding mSWI/SNF complex subunits are among the most frequently mutated, at over 20% of all human cancers, further underscoring the need for a detailed understanding of BAF complex structure, topology and mechanisms on chromatin.  Our multi-institutional collaborative network seeks to comprehensively interrogate biologic mechanisms underpinning the function of the SS18-SSX oncogenic fusion protein in synovial sarcoma and to use the approaches and the results generated to launch targeted therapeutic discovery campaigns that are directly linked to the mechanisms identified. Specifically, our approach encompasses three major areas: (1) BAF complex genomic targeting, gene regulation, and chromatin state interactions, including interactions with other chromatin regulators; (2) Understanding the role of the wild-type SS18 protein, its protein-level regulation, and mechanisms by which its stabilization can reverse SS18-SSX-mediated BAF complex activity and be exploited for therapeutic benefit; (3) Mechanistically characterizing synovial sarcoma-specific vulnerabilities, centered in chromatin-bound protein complexes and related pathways. The highly integrative nature of the PI-directed research projects and expertise within collaborator laboratories provide the strongest possible likelihood that the aims will be successfully achieved and that novel therapeutic strategies will emerge from this Center.

project	1U54CA231641-01	U54CA231641	9600275	2018	An integrated approach to analyze and target EWS/FLI in Ewing sarcoma	Grant	Overall Section Summary/Abstract The overarching goal of our FusOnC2 TEST (Targeting the Ewing Sarcoma Translocation) Center is to develop a new mechanistic understanding of EWS/FLI that will allow for the development of new therapeutic approaches for Ewing sarcoma based on inhibiting EWS/FLI.  EWS/FLI is an aberrant oncogenic transcription factor formed by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal translocation that is the driver oncoprotein of this tumor.  Multiple independent studies demonstrate a critical dependence of Ewing sarcoma cells on EWS/FLI such that blockade of the translocation is associated with a loss of proliferation, loss of cell cycle progression and ultimately reversal of oncogenic transformation.  Thus, most investigators believe that inhibition of EWS/FLI in the clinic would be the best way to treat patients with Ewing sarcoma.    Traditional chemical design of EWS/FLI inhibitors has proven challenging because the molecule does not contain traditionally “druggable” pockets.  We therefore hypothesize that a deeper scientific understanding of EWS/FLI transcriptional function in Ewing sarcoma will allow for identification of new agents.  The FusOnC2 TEST Center will focus on two critical molecular features of EWS/FLI required for its transcriptional and oncogenic function:  (i) binding of EWS/FLI to GGAA-microsatellites and related DNA response elements, and (ii) EWS/FLI self-association activities to form “hubs” that coordinate protein-interactions through low-complexity domains to mediate transcriptional function.  Targeting EWS/FLI requires diverse expertise to be focused on this problem.  The TEST Center is designed to facilitate both independent and highly-focused studies on critical components of EWS/FLI function, while at the same time interacting with the entire FusOnC2 consortium to share new knowledge, techniques, and expertise that will help facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches to Ewing sarcoma.  We believe that the TEST Center will contribute greatly to the overall success of the FusOnC2 Consortium, and help to change the paradigm for how new therapies are developed for pediatric translocation-associated cancers.

project	1U54CA231649-01A1	U54CA231649	9834547	2019	Targeting EWSR1-FLI1 through Functional, Structural and Chemical Approaches	Grant	Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone and soft tissue malignancy in children and adolescents. The five-year survival of Ewing sarcoma patients is 70%, and falls to less than 20% for those with metastatic disease, a situation that has not improved despite many years of increasingly intensive chemotherapy regimens. Survivors of Ewing sarcoma often suffer long-term deleterious effects of treatment. An immediate need exists for the development of effective, targeted therapies with decreased toxicity. Molecularly, Ewing sarcoma is characterized by one of several reciprocal chromosomal translocations that fuse a FET family protein with an ETS transcription factor, the most common of which is EWSR1-FLI1. The EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein is completely specific to Ewing sarcoma tumor cells, and thus presents an ideal target for novel therapeutics. To date, however, no such targeted therapy has become clinically available, owing to 4 major knowledge gaps. First, there is a dearth of robust in vitro model systems for functional studies of EWSR1-FLI1. Knockdown studies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines can give inconsistent results, and few primary cell types tolerate exogenous EWSR1-FLI1 expression. Second, the protein encoded by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion is a transcription factor, and there is widespread perception that such proteins are “undruggable”. Third, lead candidates of small-molecule screens reported to date have either not been shown to have a mechanistic link to EWSR1-FLI1, or fail to replicate the phenotype of Ewing sarcoma cells depleted of EWSR1-FLI1 activity. Fourth, the field has lacked relevant animal models for functional genomics and preclinical testing. Developing targeted therapy for Ewing sarcoma will require an integrated approach executed by an experienced team. Our strategy is based on several fundamentals, namely 1) systems to specifically deplete and reconstitute the EWSR1-FLI1 protein in cells; 2) an understanding of the structural biochemistry of low-complexity (LC) domains found in EWSR1 and related proteins; and 3) novel in vivo models of Ewing sarcoma for functional genomics and drug testing. Standing on this foundation, we will perform biochemical and genetic experiments to identify the binding partners and functional effectors of EWSR1-FLI1 and dissect its mechanisms of transcriptional activation. We will use our experimental systems to conduct phenotypic and target-based high- throughput screens. Finally, we are well-positioned to perform the work required to transform a compound with promising initial activity into a preclinical drug lead. Our approach to drug discovery is built upon medicinal chemistry coupled with secondary assays that maximize potency and specificity of lead compounds. We will perform target identification for lead compounds using strategies our team has successfully used for several agents currently in active preclinical development. A dedicated preclinical pharmacology core, highly integrated with the projects and with the high throughput screening core and medicinal chemistry core, will ensure optimization of delivery, PK/PD and toxicity properties of the most promising lead compounds.

Among the FusOnC2 consortium cancers of interest, synovial sarcoma has the highest incidence in the United States and worldwide, but has been a specifically underserved malignancy due to its predilection for the adolescent and young adult population and its relatively poor responsiveness to systemic therapy, compared to other pediatric sarcomas that also associate with fusion oncogenes. While much of the biology of SS18-SSX remains unknown and synovial sarcoma patients represent a clearly underserved, orphan-disease population, there are two principles at the extremes of the cancer biology spectrum that are well established. First, SS18-SSX has proven the capacity to recapitulate synovial sarcomagenesis faithfully in the mouse without the need of introduced or stochastically acquired secondary genetic changes, second SS18-SSX has biochemically demonstrated interactions with an important chromatin remodeling complex called SWI/SNF or BAF. This application proposes to build three research projects focused on the cell biology of transformation, genome-wide chromatin biology and SWI/SNF (BAF) complex componentry biology, each related to SS18- SSX. These discovery biology and therapeutic target identification efforts will be supported by two shared resource cores that will provide human validation of therapeutic targets and preclinical testing of therapeutic strategies. The group of investigators has developed as an organically assembled network of collaborations, built over the last decade, during which time each project has gathered substantial preliminary data using a variety of functional screens, a newly identified cell of origin, the ability to track SS18-SSX genome wide localization and protein interactions, a powerful system to produce and evaluate recombinant SWI/SNF (BAF) complexes with variable componentry, and powerful mouse genetic models of synovial sarcoma—including spontaneous development of metastatic disease. Preliminary data are sufficiently robust to recommend therapeutic strategies immediately from each research project for the cores to validate and evaluate in clinically relevant mouse models and quantitative molecular imaging.

To complement the funded U54 (Maris and Mackall, MPI) of the PI-DDN that largely seeks to harness adaptive immunity to further develop CAR-T cells against newly identified antigens, we propose to harness innate immunity to target pediatric cancers, to circumvent resistance to conventional therapy, and to further enable adaptive/hybrid immune approaches. Our aims are to (1) Identify and overcome barriers to utilizing NK and CAR-NK cells as cancer therapeutics, (2) break tolerance to “self” cancer-associated proteins and (3) enhance immunotherapies by targeting suppressive myeloid cells. We will accomplish our aims through four projects, based at two major sites based in Ohio (Nationwide Children’s Hospital) and New York (New York Medical College) with subsites in Columbus (The Ohio State University) and Minneapolis (Univeristy of Minnesota). In addition to an Administrative Shared Resource (Core A, directed by Dr. Timothy Cripe and Associate Director Dr. Mitchell Cairo), the projects are scientifically supported by a comprehensive Genomics & Immune Monitoring Shared Resource (Core B, directed by Dr. Elaine Mardis with several subspecialy assistant directors). Core B provides integrated datasets via state- of-the-art technologies including mass cytometry, single cell transcriptomics, and an array of other genomics approaches that enable detailed characterizations and tracking of cancer cell immunogenicity, the tumor immune microenvironment, and immunologic responses. We have also assembled strong external and internal scientific advisory boards of renowned leaders whose expertise spans the projects and shared resources. The projects are highly integrated and cross-informative. We propose that therapeutic regimens that combine modalities will produce synergy that drives anti-tumor immune responses in preclinical pediatric cancer models, overcoming the limitations of low mutational burdens. Our goal is to generate a sufficient body of knowledge with compelling data to inform the rational design of future clinical trials and thereby improve the lives of children with cancer. 1	Address;Adoptive Immunotherapy;Adoptive Transfer;Adult;Antigens;Binding;Biological;Cancer Burden;Cancer Model;Case Study;Cell surface;Cells;Childhood;Childhood Solid Neoplasm;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Combination immunotherapy;Complement;Cytometry;Data;Data Set;Development;Effectiveness;Funding;Future;Genomic approach;Genomics;Goals;Homing;Hybrids;Immune;Immune response;Immunologic Adjuvants;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Inflammatory;Innate Immune Response;Interruption;Knowledge;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Minnesota;Modality;Mutation;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Natural Immunity;Natural Killer Cells;New York;Normal Cell;Ohio;Oncolytic viruses;Patients;Pediatric Hospitals;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Physicians;Pre-Clinical Model;Proteins;Regimen;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resource Sharing;STAT3 gene;Scientist;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid Neoplasm;Source;T cell response;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Traction;Transforming Growth Factor beta;Tumor Immunity;Universities;Virotherapy;Virus;Virus Diseases;adaptive immunity;anti-tumor immune response;base;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapy;chemokine;chemoradiation;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;combinatorial;conventional therapy;cytokine;design;effective therapy;embryo/fetus antigen;experience;immunogenicity;immunotherapy clinical trials;improved;macrophage;medical schools;neoantigens;novel;oncolytic virotherapy;pre-clinical;resistance mechanism;response;small molecule;success;synergism;trafficking;transcriptomics;translational study;tumor;tumor microenvironment	RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP	COLUMBUS	OH	UNITED STATES	TIMOTHY P CRIPE,Elaine R Mardis	DCTD	Katarzyna  Bourcier	10242127	>=$1M	10242127	12-Sep-2019	12-Sep-2019	31-Aug-2024	RFA-CA-19-003	Moonshot
project	1U54CA232568-01	U54CA232568	9617113	2018	Discovery and Development of Optimal Immunotherapeutic Strategies for Childhood Cancers	Grant	OVERALL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  There is a major paradox confronting the field of childhood cancer research. Several decades ago, pioneering investigators focused on children with cancer led a revolution resulting in previously incurable malignancies becoming curable. In contrast, over the last two decades, basic science has continued to advance fundamental understanding of the oncogenesis of pediatric cancers, but cure rates for most pediatric malignancies have plateaued, and the field has witnessed first-hand that current standard therapies often saddle survivors with life threatening therapy-induced morbidities. It is sobering that for most children who suffer relapse, few if any novel therapeutic options exist, and most patients receive the same type of therapy that failed them in the first place. The funding opportunity arising out of the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot initiative directly addresses this paradox by forming a Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery and Development Network (PI-DDN). Immunotherapy for B-ALL and neuroblastoma is now credentialed, with CD19 directed immunotherapies showing unprecedented activity in highly refractory cases of lymphoid malignancies. The field is now poised for a focused and sustained multi-disciplinary effort to extend these early successes, and rethink our approach to childhood cancer therapy in general. Here, we propose a pediatric immuno-oncology Center entitled Discovery and Development of Optimal Immunotherapeutic Strategies for Childhood Cancers. We envision this Center providing a central hub for the PI-DDN, creating additional opportunities for multi-disciplinary research with the common goal of creating new cancer immunotherapies for children. This Center embodies three highly integrated multi-institutional Projects supported by a single Administrative and Statistical Core. The overarching hypothesis to be tested here is that childhood cancers harbor lineage-specific mechanisms of oncogenesis and immune evasion that can be precisely and effectively targeted by rationally designed and developed immunotherapeutic regimens. Project 1 will discover lineage specific cell surface molecules that have project-defined optimal attributes for synthetic immunotherapeutic based targeting, and use this to create and credential new therapeutics based upon preclinical efficacy in high-risk childhood cancer models. Project 2 will focus on major mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance by developing approaches to circumvent the fundamental issues of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity and T cell dysfunction due to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Project 3 will focus on a major difference between pediatric and many adult malignancies, with pediatric cancers typically eliciting little adaptive immunity, and develop approaches to enhance adaptive immune responses against pediatric cancer-specific antigenic targets. The proposed Center will discover and develop effective immunotherapeutic strategies that will be immediately translatable to the clinic, is designed to have a major direct impact on childhood cancer outcomes, and as part of the PI-DDN it will catalyze research advances across the spectrum of high-risk pediatric malignancies.

In addition, these minority populations remain underrepresented in therapeutic clinical trials. Our Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (M-PDTC) provides a unique opportunity to help address these racial/ethnic disparities. This Center is built on the scientific premise that, in addition to important socioeconomic factors, health disparities that burden racial/ethnic minorities in the US are linked to poorly understood genetic and other intrinsic factors. We propose to leverage the high numbers of minority cancer patients at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in order to generate and utilize innovative PDX models of diverse racial/ethnic minority origin, which will assist the entire scientific community delineate the molecular underpinnings of cancer of racial/ethnic minority origin. Houston is the most diverse large US city, with ~20% of its residents being African American (AA) and ~40% Hispanic. BCM faculty are responsible for clinical care at two major teaching hospitals that serve large minority populations: Ben Taub Hospital (BTH), a public hospital (91% of patients are minorities), and the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC), one of the largest VA Medical Centers in the US, which serves over 100,000 veterans in Southeast Texas (~30% are AA). Thus, there is a very large population of minority cancer patients available for potential tissue donations. BCM has a long track record of successfully enrolling minority patients in clinical trials. In addition to our large AA patient population at BCM, 59% of patients at BTH are of Hispanic ethnicity. We have assembled a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional collaborative team, bringing together experts in PDX model generation, molecular biology and signaling pathways, animal drug treatment studies, pathology and clinical management of prostate and breast cancer from BCM and MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). We are ideally positioned to leverage the technical resources of our institutions and our high numbers of racial and ethnic minority cancer patients at BCM, in order to support the broader goals of the M-PDTC RFA, in particular to facilitate biospecimen donations from these populations and increase the racial and ethnic diversity of the PDXNet repository in a wide spectrum of cancers, as well as to support the Specific Aims of our two research projects in prostate and breast cancer. Few, if any, cancer centers have this combination of an outstanding research base, large numbers of African American, Hispanic and Asian cancer patients, and BCM’s robust track record of successfully enrolling minority patients from our catchment area (Houston) into clinical trials. Moreover, our two research projects will utilize whole exome sequencing (WES), global RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), quantitative proteomic (qKiP) and metabolomic profiling and will conduct preclinical trials of promising NCI-IND drugs to uncover novel, effective treatment strategies for prostate and breast cancer in minority populations.

We have established an accomplished transdisciplinary research team with an outstanding infrastructure that includes a University of California-wide central IRB system called Reliance and strong preliminary data to support the proposed PDX and cancer disparities research, thus allowing our results to be easily translated to clinical trials. UCaMP is comprised of four University of California NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers: UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Davis), UC Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCLA), UC Irvine Health Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Irvine), and UC San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCSF). Our collective strengths include complementary expertise in PDX development and drug testing, cancer health disparities, and clinical trial development robustly supported by cores for PDX, Pilot Studies, Bioinformatics, and Administration. We will achieve our goal through two Research Projects. Project 1 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Gastric and Liver Tumors, specifically addresses cancer health disparities in gastric cancers (GC) and liver cancers (LC) that disproportionately affect all racial/ethnic minorities especially in HLA and AANHPI populations. By understanding the genetic and response differences among HLA, AANHPI compared to NHWs, we could enhance the precision of therapeutic treatments, identify resistance-associated biomarkers, and study resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Project 2 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Lung and Bladder Tumors focuses on treatment disparities between AA and NHW patients to identify therapies targeting common genetic alterations (e.g. PI3K pathway) and to reveal targeted therapy resistance mechanisms for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and advanced bladder cancer (aBC).

project	1U54CA243124-01	U54CA243124	9834651	2019	Experimental and preclinical modeling of NUP98-rearranged acute leukemia	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY - Overview Fusion oncoproteins (FO) arising from the rearrangement of Nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) to a diverse range of partner genes are a hallmark of multiple subtypes of high risk myeloid malignancies in children and adolescents, including acute erythroleukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Such leukemias are associated with poor outcome, and more effective therapies are required. The long-term goal of this Center for Experimental and Preclinical Modeling of NUP98 Leukemia is to determine the molecular role, and potential vulnerabilities, of NUP98-fusion oncoproteins in leukemia through the development and interrogation of human and mouse model systems, and to develop and test novel therapeutic approaches. The Center has assembled a consortium of investigators with complementary expertise in genomic characterization, leukemia modeling, chromatin biology, structural biology and preclinical modeling. The Center is led by Dr Charles Mullighan of St Jude Children’s Research Hospital together with Project Co-Leaders Drs Scott Armstrong (Dana Farber Cancer Institute), Taosheng Chen (St Jude), Alex Kentsis (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute), Jeffery Klco (St Jude) and Richard Kriwacki (St Jude). These investigators will co-Lead four projects performing experimental modeling (Project 1), investigating chromatin biology (Project 2), phase separation (Project 3) and drug development (Project 4) that will address the following questions and unmet needs: (1) to define how NUP98 fusions drive leukemogenesis using complementary, integrative engineered models and proteomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles; (2) to develop genetically faithful engineered mouse, human and xenograft models of NUP98 leukemia for mechanistic interrogation and preclinical modeling; (3) to define the macromolecular chromatin and protein complexes assembled by NUP98 FOs; (4) to define the role of phase separation in NUP98 FO leukemogenesis; (5) to define the dependencies and vulnerabilities of NUP98-rearranged leukemic cells; and (6) to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for NUP98-rearranged leukemia. The Center is supported by an Administrative Core A that with an External Advisory Board will oversee project progress interaction and reporting, a Genome Editing Core B led by Dr David Chen (City of Hope) that provides expertise and support for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing scans and screens; and a Chemistry Core C led by Dr Zoran Rankovic (St Jude) that supports chemical library screen and drug design and development. This highly integrated, interactive and synergistic Center will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of oncogenesis of the different classes of NUP98 FO, and new therapeutic modalities that will be validated in preclinical models and translated into human clinical trials. All data and resources will be made freely available by websites, data deposition, and establishment of resource and genomic data portals to the FusOnC2 consortium and broad scientific community.

The goal of the U54 titled “Biology and therapy of C11orf95-RELA fusion-driven ependymoma is to understand the biology of this fusion protein and the two components that make up the fusion and determine the requirements for continued expression of this fusion protein and what pathways downstream are critical for oncogenesis. We will use a combination of novel mouse models and human neuro stem cell systems with readouts of single cell analysis, immunology, tumor microenvironment, systems biology, and data visualization. In addition to the administrative core, the grant has three main Projects, a data visualization and sharing core. The research projects include, Project 1) Mechanisms and models of C11or95 and C11or95-RELA fusions (RELAFus), Project 2) Genetic interrogation of therapeutic vulnerabilities for C11orf95-RELA fusion, and Project 3) Identifying small molecules with therapeutic effects in RELAFus -driven EPN and testing them in preclinical genetically engineered models of EPN.

The primary tumor is initiated and driven by a single alteration in the DNA: A deletion of ~400kb that results in a fusion gene between the heat shock co-chaperone DNAJB1 and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, PRKACA. If the tumor is limited to the liver, then surgery is the accepted therapy. However, if the tumor has metastasized, there is no accepted therapy. This project will determine how the fusion oncoprotein leads to pathogenesis and will develop therapeutics targeted to the fusion oncoprotein. Pathogenesis is being probed by examining what is different about the fusion oncoprotein that causes changes in the cell. Therapeutics will target the fusion oncoprotein through small molecules to block activity, or small molecules to send it to the proteasome, or small molecules for allosteric inhibition.

One of the most potent agents are engineered T cells programmed to recognize and kill tumor cells. Nonetheless, our ability to engineer T cells and other immune cells and program them to execute new functions remains relatively primitive. Aside from CAR T cells for treatment of blood cancers, most engineered cell therapies are risky, potentially highly toxic, unreliable and often ineffective, especially those cell therapies that attempt to target solid cancers. We hypothesize that to fulfil the promise of engineered immune cell therapies, we must first transform cell engineering into a systematic and predictable process; one that uses reliable technology platforms and principles. Our center will focus on developing a set of sophisticated immune engineering platforms that address three major needs in next-generation cell therapies: 1) Smart recognition of cancer – develop antigen-pattern recognition circuits that direct immune cells to  optimally recognize solid tumors and discriminate against normal tissue crossreaction, guided by  computational bioinformatic analysis of gene expression patterns. 2) Overcoming the tumor microenvironment – develop multiple classes of cellular circuits that can  overcome or locally remodel immune-suppressive tumor microenvironments to promote highly efficient  therapeutic immune cell trafficking, proliferation, persistence, and tumor-killing activity 3) User-control and safety – to increase control over and safety of these powerful engineered cells, we will  develop a suite of ways to communicate with and control the activity of engineered immune cells in vivo,  including nano/microparticles and small molecules. To achieve these goals, we have assembled the UCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology, a tightly integrated interdisciplinary team that encompasses synthetic biologists, immunologists, bio-informaticists, control engineers, and materials scientists. The products of this center will include publicly available toolkits of parts and circuits for cell engineering, high-throughput platforms for rapid circuit assembly, new programmable nanomaterials for controlling immune cell behavior, searchable bioinformatic databases for optimization of tumor recognition, and computational frameworks for circuit design and for modeling/prototyping in vivo circuit function. These platforms will help to advance immune cell engineering to be far more reliable, predictable, effective and safe.

project	1U54CA244711-01	U54CA244711	9870707	2019	Engineering the Next Generation of T Cells	Grant	OVERALL SUMMARY This U54 “Immuno-engineering to Improve Immunotherapy (i3) Center” was developed in response to RFA-CA-19-013. The purpose of this U54 is to employ immuno-engineering principles to design more durable, accessible, and less toxic immunoprevention and immunotherapy strategies. A national priority set by the Cancer Moonshot initiative is to support studies incorporating next-generation genetic engineering, engineered biomaterials, nanotechnology, computational and mathematical modelling, or systems biology approaches in the design, implementation and evaluation of next generation immunotherapies focused on overcoming immunosuppressive barriers, targeting tumor cells for killing, and generating long-lasting anti-cancer immunological memory. The focus of our U54 entitled “Engineering the next generation of T cells” is on developing next-generation gene-editing or modification of immune cells to improve persistence in vivo, control and manipulate the immune system to reduce oﬀ-target toxicities and enhance anti-tumor eﬀectiveness of adoptive cell therapy. Our central hypothesis is that next generation engineering can improve the safety and efficacy of CAR T cells while decreasing the cost of goods. There are three scientific projects in our U54 Center. The shared goal of these projects is to enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer and solid cancers. In Project 1, we are using CRISPR/Cas9 to edit the epigenome of T cells and to make cells resistant to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), while employing engineering technologies to automate CAR T cell culture. The goal of Project 2 is to generate universal CAR T cells (UCART) using advanced genetic editing technologies and then to compare UCAR to autologous CAR T in a unique model of canine cancer. In Project 3 we will use advanced protein engineering, cell engineering and oncolytic vectors to test synthetic cytokine and cytokine receptor systems in mouse and human T cells, with the long-term goal of eliminating or reducing the need for lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy prior to adoptive cell transfer. Our approach is multidisciplinary and multi- institutional. We have brought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and published together for many years. State of the art genetic editing with CRISPR/Cas9 and cell culture technologies at the University of Pennsylvania are synergistically coupled with world-class protein engineering and structural biology at Stanford University. Each project is led by recognized authorities in the field. The Administrative Core for this U54 is designed to manage and coordinate all i3 Center Research Project activities and serve as the liaison between the i3 Center and the IOTN Data Management and Resource-sharing Center (U24) and other Cancer Moonshot consortia, including the Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery and Development Network (PI-DDN). In addition, the Administrative Core will coordinate collaborative research activities between the i3 Center Research Project PD(s)/PI(s) and IOTN (or other) investigators. The potential for paradigm-shifting impact this U54 is to transform the lessons of first-generation CAR T for leukemia and lymphoma into meaningful efficacy against all malignancies.

project	1U54CA244719-01	U54CA244719	9870537	2019	Nano-Immuno-Oncology Approaches to Overcome Tumor Immune Evasion	Grant	Abstract  While immunotherapies have achieved remarkable success in cancer care in recent years, a large percentage of patients remain unresponsive to currently available treatments. Growing evidence indicates dysfunctional innate and adaptive immune responses in the tumor microenvironment are responsible for tumor evasion that limits the efficacy of the current immunotherapies. Efficacious cancer immunotherapy requires a holistic, system approach to identify and engage key molecular and cellular pathways as well as tumor microenvironment signals to benefit a broad spectrum of cancer patients. The overarching goal of this U54 i3 Center application is to harness research synergy in immunobiology, protein engineering and cancer nanotechnology to develop and validate new nano-immuno-oncology therapeutics for cancer therapy. Four investigators, Zhijian `James' Chen, Yang-Xin Fu, Baran Sumer, and Jinming Gao, supported by the Administrative Core, will advance the frontier of knowledge of molecular and cellular engineering of the tumor immune milieu for robust antitumor immunity. Each project will bring a unique toolset and therapeutic strategy to tackle the immune refractory challenges in solid tumors. Dr. Chen will lead Project 1 to investigate the role of cGAS-STING pathway in intrinsic tumor immunity and evaluate antitumor efficacy of cGAMP nanoparticles in endogenous tumor models. Dr. Fu will lead Project 2 to engineer tumor-targeted delivery of CD47 and T cell activators (IL-2/IL-15) to stimulate innate and adaptive antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Dr. Gao and Dr. Sumer will lead Project 3 to establish CD47-encoded ultra-pH sensitive nanoparticles as a broad nanoplatform for tumor-targeted delivery of innate and adaptive immune modulators. If successful, our studies will develop innovative and synergistic combinations of small molecular agonists, engineered antibodies and cytokines, and pH sensitive nanoparticle technology. The U54 i3 Center will create a new paradigm for cancer immunotherapy by targeting key molecular, cellular and tumor microenvironment signals to generate and sustain tumor-specific innate and adaptive immunity. Ultimately, this paradigm could significantly advance clinical care for patients with intractable cancers.

project	1U54CA244726-01	U54CA244726	9870084	2019	Biomaterials to Create T Cell Immunity	Grant	Summary – Overall: T lymphocyte (T cell) responses against tumor antigens are key to cancer immunotherapy, and this proposal is focused on enhancing T cell mediated anti-cancer immunity using biomaterials. Defects in T cell number, differentiation, activation and anti-cancer activity can compromise anti-cancer immunity. We envision biomaterials that act at various stages of T cell differentiation and activation to enhance anti-cancer immunity in a number of settings. This i3 Center will advance efficacious biomaterial-based immunotherapies through marrying the expertise in bioengineering from accomplished investigators at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering with the expertise in cancer immunology, stem cell biology, and clinical oncology from accomplished basic and translational scientists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. Our groups have made major contributions to the development of checkpoint blockade therapy, neoantigen vaccines, cellular therapies, and therapeutic biomaterials in the past, and here will take a material- based approach to address a number of related, fundamental questions in immunoengineering. The Specific Aims of the i3 Center are: (1) To develop artificial antigen presenting cells that closely mimic normal T cell activation to selectively expand large numbers of highly functional polyclonal antigen-specific CD8 T cells, and explore if adoptive transfer of polyclonal T cells will provide tumor control. (2) Determine if co-delivery of neoantigens and adjuvants with precise nanoscale distribution and stoichiometric loading, using DNA origami, can provide a powerful platform to boost the development of cytotoxic T lymphocyte anti-cancer responses, and (3) Create biomaterials which recreate key features of the normal hematopoietic stem cell niche, and utilize to enable rapid reconstitution of T cells in settings where there are deficiencies in T cell number and repertoire, in order to enhance generation of T cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity. The leadership and organizational structure of the i3 Center, which includes a Biostatistics Core, reflect the close collaboration among the participating disciplines and institutions, and will promote the effective execution of the proposed work and its future translation to clinical testing. The synergistic set of activities in the i3 not only address specific stages where immune control can fail, but the lessons learned and technologies developed in each project strongly impact the others. The Center is expected to yield major scientific and translational advances in cancer immunotherapy.

project	1UG3CA233229-01	UG3CA233229	9627196	2018	ACCISIS-Chicago	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) not only detects disease early but also prevents cancer by finding and removing precancerous polyps. The overall goal of our project, Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-up through Implementation Science in Chicago (ACCSIS-Chicago), is to test a multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in Chicago, Illinois. In this project, we will include two different types of implementation strategies: 1) evidence-based multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care; and 2) implementation support strategies to support the implementation process that contribute to the adoption, implementation and sustainment of our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention. We will partner with 4 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which have 35 clinics in the Chicago area and provided primary care service to nearly 188,000 racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in 2016. During the UG3 Planning-Exploratory Phase, we will work with one of the 4 FQHC partners to pilot test, measure, and refine our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention in preparation for the experimental trial in the UH3 Implementation Phase, as well as assess the effectiveness of our implementation support strategies. In the UH3 Implementation Phase, we will use a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and impact of our multilevel, multicomponent intervention on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care across our 4 partner FQHCs. The selection of our intervention components will be based on intensive literature review, and findings and lessons learned from our previous studies and projects. Our multilevel intervention components will include EMR provider reminders, provider assessment and feedback, patient navigation, provider education and community outreach. We will also test one local innovation, IL ColonCARES, during the UGH Phase to increase the rate of follow-up after a positive stool test among uninsured patients by linking uninsured patients with specialty services. We expect the finding from this study to have broad impact on understanding the implementation process to increase colorectal cancer screening, follow up, and referral to care across diverse health systems.

In North Carolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions. Community health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable populations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%. Substantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and system-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening targets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based screening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase screening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to systematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for uninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from stakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We hypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective approaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through improved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research, implementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central hypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based interventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable. The specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot studies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a process for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2 (Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening approaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess implementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the multilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This project is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation modeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact on CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities.

project	1UG3CA233282-01	UG3CA233282	9627516	2018	(ACCSIS) Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia	Grant	Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia This multi-site project aims to increase screening and follow-up for colorectal cancer (CRC) in central Appalachia, a medically underserved region recognized as one of three distinct “hotspots” for CRC mortality. Specifically, the Appalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern Kentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the area are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents screened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence on CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with Appalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention and control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted from evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the community (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in 12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base for a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically underserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden of CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test, measure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH and Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI approval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI in a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2) Assess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with community and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to early or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined by US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county- level behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating Center, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community partners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia.

project	1UG3CA233314-01A1	UG3CA233314	9870730	2019	CRC-HUB-SPOKE: A ColoRectal Cancer screening Hub for Southern California community health centers.	Grant	ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends CRC screening through a variety of invasive and non- invasive tests for individuals aged 50 to 75 years. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and other strategies exist to promote CRC screening, but adoption and implementation of these are limited, especially in CHCs. Our hypothesis is that a Hub and Spoke multilevel intervention will be superior to usual care. The hub will be Health Quality Partners of Southern California (HQP), a non-profit organization comprised of 16 CHC systems (spokes), serving 135 rural and urban clinic sites. We propose a 2-phase study to pilot and optimize (Phase I) and rigorously test (Phase II) the Hub and Spoke approach and its impact on CRC screening, follow-up, and usual care. UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed methods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients served by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and coordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3 Implementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a regionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness of the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post implementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3) proportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and sustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods approach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM constructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e. patients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and Sustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of Implementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate progress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are scalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.

Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up colonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage partnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest Center for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation support to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate working with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics (reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients). In Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a large-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor supported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never been screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to support follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and recruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the training and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings. In Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi- experimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice facilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan- vendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never been screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred for colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will evaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and qualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program through partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care clinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model.

Among patients with NF1, loss of the non-mutant allele of NF1 in a rare Schwann cell or precursor, along with other ill-defined factors, leads to benign dermal or plexiform neurofibromas. The main cause of death among NF1 patients is the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most likely develops from plexiform neurofibroma, in particular the so-called “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma. Approximately half of MPNSTs are NF1-associated, and NF1 patients have 10-15% lifetime risk of developing this terrible cancer. MPNSTs metastasize early and are often resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main treatment for MPNSTs is surgical resection but, despite radical excision with wide surgical margins, followed by chemoradiation, 5-year survival rates are poor due to metastases as well as local recurrence. NF1 patients could greatly benefit from prophylactic vaccination that would prevent the malignant transformation of benign plexiform neurofibromas into “atypical” plexiform neurofibromas and to MPNSTs. We aim to determine if the mutations that govern the development of “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma (NF1 loss followed by CDKN2A loss) and MPSNT (NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12 loss) lead to the expression of recurrent alternately processed transcripts, such as transcriptionally-induced chimeras, that could express neoantigens and be used as targets for prophylactic vaccines. Such transcripts can be translated to produce novel peptides downstream of frameshift mutations caused by coding exon read-through into introns, mis-splicing from a coding exon to a non-canonical splice acceptors or splice acceptors in other genes. In most cases, a premature termination codon (PTC) will be rapidly encountered by the ribosome translating such transcripts. Therefore, we furthermore hypothesize that these alternately processed transcripts can express what we call “cryptic” neoantigens when treated with drugs that suppress utilization of premature codons such as Ataluren or gentamycin. In such a way, we could administer a prophylactic vaccine and induce conditionally active immune response that would eliminate nascent tumors only when drug treatment is used.

project	1UG3CA244697-01	UG3CA244697	9870498	2019	Intercepting progression from pre-invasive to invasive lung adenocarcinoma	Grant	Abstract Despite advances in therapeutic strategies, non-small cell lung cancer remains a deadly disease. An improved understanding of the biology of lung cancer is needed to intercept the disease at an early point in its progression. Our project, which is inspired by that challenge, focuses on events transpiring in the earliest radiographically-detected manifestation of lung cancer: the computerized tomography (CT)-detected non- solid nodule, of which as many as 40% harbor frankly invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, despite conventional wisdom that CT-detected non-solid nodules represent pre or minimally invasive malignancy, clearly transition to more invasive histologies occurs in a significant proportion of these nodules. Understanding the cellular and molecular changes within non-solid nodules that drive progression will provide unique and novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that alterations in cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a role in initiating and supporting this progression. In agreement with that proposal, our preliminary multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) studies suggest that progression to a more invasive phenotype is associated with the development of a strong immunosuppressive TME. In this project we test our hypothesis using multidimensional methods to profile the TME and to determine the crosstalk between cancer cells and the TME in pre-invasive to invasive human lung non-solid adenocarcinomas. Comparative analysis of the cellular and molecular events associated with the distinct histological stages will lead to identification of the critical events triggering progression and thereby identify targets to intercept disease progression. We will use appropriate mouse models in pre-clinical studies to develop these targets as strategies to intercept progression of pre-invasive to invasive cancer. In the first phase of these studies (UG3 phase), we will define TME alterations associated with progression of lung nodules using RNAseq profiling and image-based methods (multiplex IF and imaging CyTOF) in studies of our archival tumor samples. These studies will generate a comprehensive catalogue of the cellular and molecular events that trigger progression of indolent lesions to frankly invasive cancers, with a strong focus on immune mechanisms. These analyses will provide novel and detailed insights into how the composition and activity of the TME changes with progression. In the second phase (UH3 phase), we will leverage mouse models to explore interception strategies to target immune mechanisms and prevent progression. The proposed cohort satisfies the RFA’s focus on High-Risk Cohorts for Cancer-Immunoprevention Studies, since lung nodules are premalignancies highly prevalent in smokers.

project	1UH2CA263954-01	UH2CA263954	10300193	2021	Imaging the native 3D architecture of pancreatic and breast tumor patient tissue at single-cell resolution	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer remains the second-leading cause of adult death in the United States, yet the mechanisms by which cancerous growths are initiated and how crucial transitions such as metastasis and therapeutic resistance occur are not well understood. Significant progress has been made in the multiplexed analysis of solid tumors through the use of single-cell sequencing and spatio-molecular mapping techniques. However, despite the unique insights into tumor heterogeneity these methods have afforded, they are limited to two-dimensional (2D) thin analyses which provide little information on the native three-dimensional architecture of the tumor. Serial reconstruction can provide some three-dimensional context, but such approaches are both inefficient in terms of sample throughput and are inherently destructive to the tissue architecture. We propose a cross-disciplinary, approach to quantitatively characterize the native three-dimensional architecture of human solid tumor tissue from triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients using a combination of the state-of-the art, yet mature technologies of tissue clearing, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization labeling, and high-resolution lightsheet fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of these tissue volumes will enable the elucidation of the spatial interactome of different tumor, immune and stromal cells that give rise to tumor heterogeneity as well as their interactions with components of the tumor microenvironment. Our Specific Aims are (1) to image the three-dimensional spatial distribution of tumor, immune and stromal cells in relation to vasculature, lymphatics and the extracellular matrix in native solid tumor tissue from human pancreatic and breast malignancies using a combination of tissue clearing, immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization and 3D lightsheet microscopy, and (2) to develop a computational pipeline to build three-dimensional spatial maps of protein expression and RNA transcript localization in intact solid tumor tissue from human pancreatic and breast malignancies. The innovation of the proposed work lies in our cross-disciplinary strategy of combining the cutting- edge tissue clearing, multiplexed labelling and high-resolution lightsheet microscopy to better understand the native three-dimensional architecture of solid tumors. Specifically, by classifying and quantitating previously unknown three-dimensional features of solid tumor tissue we will be able to relate the spatial organization of the tumor to genomic and proteomic data taken from the same specimen. The significance of this proposal is that successful three-dimensional characterization of human tumor tissues will enable key insights to be derived on both intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity thus facilitating the identification of cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions that could serve as potential therapeutic targets thus providing new routes to treatments to decrease patient mortality and improve quality of life.	3-Dimensional;Address;Adult;Architecture;Atlases;Breast;Breast Cancer Patient;CD8B1 gene;CXCL14 gene;Cancerous;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Cessation of life;Collagen;Complex;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;DNA;Data;Data Set;Detection;Diagnosis;Extracellular Matrix;FBXW7 gene;Fluorescence Microscopy;Genomics;Growth;Human;Image;Imaging Techniques;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;In Situ Hybridization;Inter-tumoral heterogeneity;Label;Lymphatic;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Maps;Methods;Microscopy;Molecular;Neoplasm Metastasis;Optics;PECAM1 gene;Pancreas;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Population;Proteomics;Quality of life;RNA;Reporter;Research;Resolution;Route;Sampling;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Spatial Distribution;Specimen;Speed;Stains;Stromal Cells;Techniques;Technology;Thinness;Three-Dimensional Imaging;Tissue Sample;Tissues;Transcript;Tumor Tissue;United States;Universities;Vimentin;Visualization;Washington;Woman;Work;analysis pipeline;breast malignancies;cell type;cellular imaging;computational pipelines;computational suite;computerized tools;dimensional analysis;experimental study;human tissue;imaging approach;improved;innovation;insight;lymphatic vasculature;men;molecular imaging;mortality;neoplastic cell;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell;pancreatic neoplasm;protein biomarkers;protein expression;reconstruction;single cell sequencing;spatial relationship;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;two-dimensional	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	SAINT LOUIS	MO	UNITED STATES	James Alexander Fitzpatrick,Tao  Ju,Stephen Tracy Oh	DCB	Shannon K Hughes	360281	$250k to $499k	360281	3-Aug-2021	3-Aug-2021	31-Jul-2023	RFA-CA-20-042	Moonshot
project	1UM1CA233033-01	UM1CA233033	9625964	2018	Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) Pragmatic Clinical Trial	Grant	Cancer and its treatment engender disabling symptoms that are frequently undertreated, and associated with needlessly increased healthcare utilization, non-adherence to oncologic treatments, and reduced survival. The key to addressing this damaging situation lies in reliably detecting symptoms and providing evidence-based care. Of note, the National Academy of Medicine has identified systematic screening with patient reported outcomes (PROs) as critical, not only to symptom control, but also to enhancing the patient centricity and effectiveness of cancer care in general. Unfortunately, experience has shown that simply presenting PRO data to over-loaded, treatment-focused clinicians has minimal or no impact on the outcomes of patients with many diseases, including cancer. On the other hand, providing these data to mid-level providers and entrusting them to initiate, monitor and adapt individually tailored symptom management plans has proven robustly effective in the control of cancer-related and other symptoms. However, the high resource requirements of this approach have heretofore limited its dissemination and scalability. Encouragingly, such resource intense care is not always required for meaningfully benefit, as attested by the effectiveness of interventions that provide patients experiencing mild or moderate with self-management education. This application recognizes the need for both low- and high-touch approaches to cancer symptom control and proposes the Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) pragmatic clinical trial to test a bundled intervention that leverages EHR interface and clinical decision support functionalities to operationalize the population-level implementation of an approach that automatically triages symptomatic patients to low-touch automated self-management (Level 1), or high-touch nurse care management (Level 2), both validated, depending on PRO scores, as well as patient and clinical factors. The E2C2 intervention will target Sleep disturbance, Pain, Anxiety, Depression, and Energy deficit/fatigue, the SPADE pentad which represents the most prevalent and potentially treatable group of overlapping cancer symptoms. To rigorously assess the effectiveness of discrete E2C2 intervention components, we will initially test a Stage 1 Symptom Control Bundle for 12 months, after which we will add a Stage 2 Implementation Bundle. The trial's stepped wedge design will randomize the order of E2C2 implementation among 21 clusters. Clusters will be defined at the level of the cancer care team, and will be randomized to one of five different tranches to receive the intervention at staggered 6 month intervals. Outcomes will include SPADE symptom scores (primary), physical function, social participation, quality of life, distress, healthcare utilization, adherence to cancer treatment, and vital status which will be collected for 9-12 months during each trial phase; pre-E2C2, Stage 1 and Stage 2. A multi-stakeholder, mixed methods approach will be used to comprehensively assess the impact of the Stage 2 Implementation Bundle, as well as both Stages' impact on rurally-based and elderly patients, groups prone to disparities in symptom control.

project	1UM1CA233035-01	UM1CA233035	9625977	2018	Implementation and Evaluation of an Expanded Bilingual Electronic Symptom Management Program across a Multi-site, Fully-integrated Comprehensive Cancer Center	Grant	Cancer, and cancer treatment, cause many symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life. Despite the development of improved symptom management interventions, and several evidence- and consensus-based guidelines, their timely delivery remains uneven in the health care system. Our research center, Northwestern University IMPACT (NU IMPACT), builds upon an integrated cancer symptom monitoring and management system (NMPRO), currently deployed by our health care delivery system. We will test the effectiveness of a system-wide symptom management intervention when implemented across the Northwestern Memorial HealthCare Corporation (NMHC) outpatient oncology clinics. Using a clinic-level randomized roll-out implementation trial design, we will further test, using an embedded patient-level randomized controlled clinical trial, the effectiveness of an enhanced care (EC) approach aimed to engage participants actively, and to increase self-efficacy, in the monitoring and managing of their symptoms. The existing NMPRO will constitute usual care (UC), and added patient engagement and activation features will comprise the EC condition. This innovative hybrid trial design allows for a within- and between-site evaluation of implementation along with a sufficiently powered group-based comparison to demonstrate effectiveness on individual patient outcomes.  We propose three specific aims that target both patient- and system-level outcomes. Aim 1: Implement a fully-integrated oncology symptom assessment and management program across six clinical units that are part of the NMHC healthcare delivery system; Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the program by conducting a hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the enhanced care program (EC: symptom monitoring & self-management intervention), relative to usual care (UC) on patient- and system-level outcomes; Aim 3: Identify facilitators and barriers to implementation and disseminate to other health systems. We will enroll an estimated 12,671 participants. To address possible contamination effects within each clinical unit, and allow for unit-level data collection for pre- and post-implementation comparison within and across clinical units, 50% will be enrolled and followed prior to program implementation. The other half will be enrolled post-implementation and will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (stratified by sex and cancer phase; curative intent, non-curative intent & survivorship) to UC versus EC. Fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression will be assessed using PROMIS® computerized adaptive tests (CATs). In addition, we will assess patient clinical outcomes, including healthcare utilization, and cancer treatment delivery outcomes. The NU IMPACT study design allows joint evaluation of system-level implementation and patient-level effectiveness metrics. An extensive array of longitudinal EHR data will be integrated using custom informatics tools and deployed for statistical analysis using plans that blend psychometric and biostatistical outcome evaluation models. Successful elements of this intervention approach will then be extended to widespread adoption.

project	1UM1CA233080-01	UM1CA233080	9626037	2018	SIMPRO Research Center: Integration and Implementation of PROs for Symptom Management in Oncology Practice	Grant	Project Summary In 2018, more than 1.7 million Americans will receive a new cancer diagnosis and nearly 600,000 will die from their disease. Cancer treatments, including major surgical resection and palliative chemotherapy, are associated with frequent adverse symptoms. The primary burden for managing symptoms falls on patients and their caregivers, and there is ample evidence that untreated symptoms impair quality of life, lead to inefficient use of emergency care, avoidable hospitalizations, and even shorten survival. Electronic tracking of patient- reported outcomes (ePROs) between face-to-face clinic visits has been shown to both reduce symptom burden and decrease the need for acute care. Although there is abundant evidence that symptom monitoring can improve cancer care, current experience has been largely limited to single centers or as part of clinical trials. Using ePROs to facilitate symptom control is an attractive strategy but, evidence for effectiveness in different treatment contexts and across varied populations is needed. Further, ePRO tracking systems have not been fully integrated into health systems' electronic health records (EHR) and this deficit prevents them from delivering the maximal benefits of proactive symptom management. To fill gaps in the evidence base about the optimal strategy for deploying ePROs, a multidisciplinary team from 6 health systems have formed the Symptom Management IMplementation of Patient Reported Outcomes in Oncology (SIMPRO) Research Center. SIMPRO's overarching goal is to develop, implement, and evaluate a multi-component ePRO reporting and management system to improve symptom control for patients recovering from cancer surgery or patients receiving palliative chemotherapy in small, rural, and community cancer centers. The Specific Aims of the project are to: (1) Adapt existing ePRO symptom management systems and integrate them into the EHR and routine clinical workflow at six health systems; (2) Determine the effectiveness of an EHR-integrated ePRO symptom management system on health outcomes; and (3) Evaluate the facilitators and barriers to implementation of an EHR-integrated ePRO symptom management system from the patient, clinical and organizational perspectives. Following the adaptation of operational ePRO prototypes and full integration into an EHR, the SIMPRO investigators will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial with stepped wedge rollout to investigate the effectiveness of a symptom monitoring system from a patient, clinician and health system perspective. Across all study phases, the implementation process itself, including ePRO adoption, appropriateness, acceptability, penetration/scalability, and adaptation, will be critically evaluated. This approach will create knowledge that can be used to guide dissemination of ePROs and other interventions to improve cancer care delivery.

project	2P01CA154303-06	P01CA154303	9279632	2017	Protein Kinase Therapeutic Targets for Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma	Grant	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States and world-wide, with over 85% of cases due to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The goal of our Program is to advance the pre-clinical science of NSCLC therapeutics. During the current funding period, our Program has advanced inhibitors of EGFR, promoting the pre-clinical development of osimertinib and related molecules, of TBK1, and of DDR2. In its next 5 years, our Program aims to develop compounds that will lead to more effective treatments for NSCLC and prevent or overcome resistance to existing and future targeted therapies.  To accomplish these goals, the Program seeks to achieve the following overall aims via 3 inter-related and collaborative Projects and 4 intellectually driven Shared Resource Cores. --Overall Aim 1. Develop inhibitors and/or degraders focused on mutant EGFR, KRAS signaling effectors, and mechanisms of transcriptional adaptation in non-small cell lung cancer. --Overall Aim 2. Characterize these compounds and their targets pharmacologically using genetically defined cellular and animal models of lung cancer. --Overall Aim 3. Develop and assess combinations of these potent and selective novel agents with existing therapies to prevent and overcome therapeutic resistance.  These aims leverage innovations in chemistry and structural biology—the development of allosteric kinase inhibitors and selective degraders—coupled with expertise in lung cancer biology, lung cancer cellular and animal modeling, and functional genomic approaches to understanding pathways, through the Projects and Cores. The broad aims will be implemented with three focused projects aimed at developing inhibitors of key pathways in NSCLC as well as over-arching mechanisms of resistance: --Project 1: Development of pharmacologic strategies to degrade mutant EGFR. --Project 2: Identification of combination therapy for KRAS-driven lung cancers. --Project 3: Targeting transcriptional mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.  Each Project and the overall Program is based on the innovative, technology-driven Cores, each led by faculty with expertise in the specific areas. Core A: Medicinal Chemistry. Core B: Structure and Biochemistry. Core C: Animal Modeling and Preclinical Therapeutics. Core D: Program Administration.  The integration of the three Projects and the four Cores will enable an effective co-ordination to meet Program aims by cross-fertilization of lung cancer focus and technological expertise.

During the prior 4 years of funding period, we have 1. defined the role of transplant in the era of novel agents; 2 Established the role of molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) in myeloma. 3. Established the role of both MRI and PET/CT in diagnosis and follow up of MM patients. 4. Identified and Validated number of novel targets. and 5. Defined patterns of clonal evolution and mutational signatures being utilized in MM. Our program has also developed novel targeted sequencing platform, developed a pipeline to identify mutations using RNA-seq, and developed a publicly available data analysis portal (Canevolve.org). Building on these advances, The overall specific objectives of the program are 1) To determine whether maintenance can be tailored based upon MRD status and whether achieving MRD negative status provides superior outcome In a 1260 patient randomized clinical study and to develop novel risk model (Project 1). Clinically annotated patient samples from this clinical trial will be utilized to study genomic and epigenomic correlates; 2) To identify the spectrum of epigenomic lesions and enhancer dependencies that underlie pathogenesis, progression, and clinical outcome in MM. (Project 2). New clinically-relevant epigenomic-centered targets identified will be validated further; 3) To identify and validate the molecular circuits/loops responsible for continued MM cell growth and develop strategies to interrupt these loops as a novel therapeutic approach. (Project 3). New targeted therapeutic agents will be translated to clinical trials to improve patient outcome; and 4) To define the impact of therapy on clonal evolution and identify mediators of genomic instability underlying disease prognosis and progression in MM (Project 4). New clinically relevant processes identified will be used to understand process of progression. These 4 projects will be supported by Administrative and Communication Core (1), Clinical and Tissue Core (2); Genomics Core (3); Genomic Sequencing Core (4) and Biostatistical and Bioinformatics Cores (5). This unique collaborative effort will improve our understanding of myeloma biology and define a new treatment paradigm for this presently incurable disease.

project	2P50CA186786-06	P50CA186786	9791695	2019	Michigan Prostate SPORE	Grant	Since inception in 1995, the University of Michigan (U-M) Prostate SPORE has endeavored to tap the vast intellectual and physical resources of the U-M community to decrease the morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer (PCa). In this renewal application, U-M joins forces with Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) to propose a “Michigan Prostate SPORE” leveraging our institutions' respective areas of strength. KCI has a non-overlapping patient population as U-M, which includes an underserved population. The Michigan Prostate SPORE supports an interactive group of basic and clinical investigators in a translational research program that has led to major discoveries in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of PCa. Successful translation of discoveries in the most recent grant period include: 1) The ETS gene fusions (which were discovered by this SPORE program) have been established as a urine test for the early detection of PCa (JAMA Oncology 2017 3:1085) and have been therapeutically targeted with peptidomimetic inhibitors (Cancer Cell 2017 31:844). 2) Our SPORE program played a significant role in defining the clinically actionable landscape of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (Cell 2015, 162:454) which led to the discovery that upwards of 20-25% of mCRPC harbor defects in DNA repair genes. As part of the TO-PARP study, we showed that mCRPC patients with DNA repair defects preferentially respond to PARP inhibitors (NEJM 2015, 373:1697). 3) Established that BET bromodomain inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of advanced PCa by blocking oncogenic transcription factor activity (Nature 2014, 510:278). 4) Several PCa-associated long non-coding RNAs, including PCAT1, Schlap1 (Nature Genetics 2013 45:1392), and ARlnc1 (Nature Genetics 2018, 50:814) were discovered and characterized. These bench-to-bedside applications were aided by horizontal collaborations with the University of Washington, Dana Farber, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and Weill-Cornell Prostate SPOREs as well as the EDRN and vertical collaborations with SWOG and biotech companies. This application consists of four projects: Project 1: Targeting mCRPC Patients with Biallelic Loss of CDK12; Project 2: Integrating a Novel MiPS-Based Next- Generation Sequencing Urine Assay for the Early Detection of Unfavorable Risk PCa; Project 3: Exploring Ablation of the Androgen Receptor as a Therapeutic Approach for mCRPC; Project 4: Targeting Autophagy in the Treatment of mCRPC. These projects are complemented by strong, ongoing institutional commitments of money and space, successful Career Development and Developmental Research Programs, and three cores: Administration, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics, and Biospecimen/Pathology. The Michigan Prostate SPORE continues to place premiums on rigorous scientific review of its translational research programs, pairing of basic and clinical investigators, drawing on expertise of scientists from within and from outside the PCa field, and utilizing flexibility to fund promising new research approaches.

project	2R01AR050026-12A1	R01AR050026	9323617	2017	Inflammation and Cardiovascular Disease in Rheumatoid Arthritis	Grant	ABSTRACT Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at 50% greater risk for developing heart failure (HF) and HF- associated morbidity and mortality than non-RA controls. This risk persists even after adjustment for coronary artery disease, implying that immunologic and inflammatory factors intrinsic to RA contribute to the increased risk of HF. Our overall hypothesis is that myocardial inflammation and microvascular ischemia are prevalent in RA patients, are mediated by antibodies to myocardial citrullinated proteins, promote impairment of left ventricular (LV) structure/function, and are attenuated with RA therapies. Indeed, in 128 RA patients without clinical CVD who underwent [18fluoro-deoxyglucose] positron emission-computed tomography (FDG PET-CT) (the RHYTHM study), we observed FDG uptake (inflammation) in 35% and impaired myocardial blood flow reserve (MFR) in 29%. Both myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR were strongly associated with clinical and laboratory measures of RA disease activity; impaired MFR was also associated with higher LV mass, a known precursor of HF. These data suggest that myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR mediate, in part, early changes in LV structure/function that predate clinical HF; but it is critical to confirm these relationships in longitudinal studies. Proximal events that mediate myocardial pathology in RA are unknown. We hypothesize that antibodies against citrullinated myocardial proteins (APCAs) mediate, in part, this abnormal myocardial phenotype (inflammation and impaired MFR), leading to myocardial remodeling and ultimately to functional decline. Our preliminary data demonstrating seroreactivity in 30% of RHYTHM sera in a novel myocardial protein array support this hypothesis. A related question is whether tumor necrosis inhibitors (TNFi’s) affect myocardial inflammation. This is a far from insignificant question as TNFi’s were associated with increased HF hospitalizations and death in non-RA HF patients and their risk for HF in RA is still unclear despite widespread use. In the next funding period, we seek to extend the study period for the RHYTHM cohort for aims 1 and 3, and to utilize an independently funded study (TARGET) for aim 2, in order to investigate the following aims: 1) To determine if imaging indicators of myocardial pathology at baseline (inflammation, impaired MFR) are predictive of longitudinal (adverse) change in measures of LV structure and function over 4-6 years in RA patients without clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. 2) To determine, in a currently enrolling NIH-NIAMS funded randomized clinical trial (the TARGET study), if RA therapies reduce myocardial inflammation. 3) To determine if seroreactivity to citrullinated myocardial antigens in RHYTHM participants is associated with baseline myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR and/or with change over time in parameters of LV structure/function. These investigations will advance understanding of mechanisms that contribute to and mitigate increased risk of myocardial dysfunction in RA.

project	2R01CA121118-11A1	R01CA121118	10120567	2021	A High-Throughput Model for Human Melanoma	Grant	Significant advances in melanoma research have resulted in new therapies that have remarkably improved the management and overall survival of melanoma. However, many patients still succumb to the disease and more than half of all melanoma deaths are due to brain metastases. As a means to overcome this challenge, we developed a novel mouse model that allows postnatal delivery of genes of interest to melanocytes. Using genomic and proteomic data from human melanoma samples, we tested several gene combinations for their ability to induce metastatic melanoma in vivo. Hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the context of mutant BRAF and CDKN2A loss resulted in the development of spontaneous melanoma with full penetrance and a mean survival of only 6 weeks. The majority of these mice also developed multiple metastases to the lungs and brain. This model mimics the human disease genetically, histologically, and by sites of metastasis. Importantly, this model system provides a powerful platform to further study the mechanisms of melanoma metastasis. Elucidation of this network will allow the identification of key pathway nodes that represent potential therapeutic targets to disrupt this process. We used next generation sequencing and proteomics analysis of non-metastatic and metastatic tumor samples to identify downstream targets of AKT1 implicated in melanoma brain metastasis. Our data showed that tumors expressing activated AKT1 displayed elevated levels of focal adhesion (FA) factors and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (P-FAK). In addition, mutant AKT1 expression increased invasion and this was reduced by pharmacological inhibition of either AKT or FAK. Moreover, loss of PTEN, which also results in increased FAK activity, cooperated with activated AKT1 to further enhance brain metastasis in vivo. Despite these promising preliminary findings, a critical gap still remains in understanding whether and how FAK promotes melanoma brain metastasis, and whether the AKT1-FAK-PTEN axis can be exploited as a therapeutic target in this disease. Our long-term goal is to use this knowledge to develop novel melanoma therapies and improve patient outcomes. Pursuant to this goal, we have generated a diverse collection of state-of-the-art research tools and assembled a talented team of scientists and clinicians with a track record of productive collaboration to carry out and critically evaluate the results of the proposed aims. Using these unique resources, we propose to test the following hypotheses: 1) AKT1→ FAK signaling is essential for the development of melanoma brain metastases; 2) Combined inhibition of BRAFV600E, MEK, and FAK is superior to standard of care targeted therapy and; 3) Loss of PTEN expression results in sustained FAK phosphorylation, which enhances the development of melanoma brain metastases. Successful completion of the aims in this proposal will significantly impact the field by laying the groundwork for translation into clinical trials, leading to new and better treatments for patients with brain metastases and those who are at high risk of developing brain metastases.

project	2R01CA124633-11A1	R01CA124633	9596560	2018	Pathogenesis and Treatment of NUT-Midline Carcinoma	Grant	Project Summary Abstract. NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), with a median survival of 6.7 months, is one of the most aggressive solid tumors known. It is a subtype of squamous cell carcinoma characterized by translocation of the NUT (aka NUTM1) gene, most commonly forming a fusion to the double-bromodomain encoding protein (BET), BRD4. There is an urgent need for the identification of more specific therapeutic targets in NMC. The over-reaching goal of this proposed project is to greater understand the mechanism of BRD4-NUT oncogenesis and identify effective therapeutic targets for treating this disease.  BRD4-NUT functions to block differentiation and maintain proliferation of NMC cells, largely through activation of MYC expression. This function is disrupted upon treatment with BET inhibitors, which as acetyl- lysine mimetics prevent binding of BRD4 bromodomains to acetylated chromatin. BRD4-NUT drives the expression of pro-growth target genes, including MYC, through the formation of megabase-sized massive hyperacetylated 'megadomains'. BRD4-NUT megadomains arise from pre-existing active enhancers and spread to fill cell-type-specific topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are higher order genomic structures whose function is to orchestrate cell-fate determining transcriptional programs through DNA-DNA contacts. Unique proteins recruited by BRD4-NUT recently identified by our group include the histone acetyl- transferase (HAT), p300, and several ZNF proteins collectively termed Z4. These findings indicate that BRD4- NUT ‘hijacks’ cell-type specific TADs to drive transcription of pro-growth, anti-differentiative genes as postulated in the following model: First, BRD4-NUT complex proteins seed regions corresponding to cell-type- specific active TADs through the chromatin-binding of BRD4. Second, megadomains form from contiguous expansion of BRD4-NUT complexes across chromatin in a feed-forward manner dependent upon p300 HAT activity. Third, megadomain size is limited by TAD boundaries and HDAC activity recruited by the Z4 complex. Fourth, hyperacetylated chromatin, recruitment of chromatin remodelers, and upregulation of cis lncRNAs changes the chromatin configuration to enhance DNA-DNA interactions to drive transcription of key pro- growth, anti-differentiative genes. The goals of this proposal are to test this hypothetical model, as listed in the specific aims below. Aim 1. To determine how BRD4-NUT megadomains form. Aim 2. To determine how BRD4-NUT megadomains function. Impact. Successful completion of the aims is expected to identify key BRD4-NUT-associated proteins in pathologic megadomain formation, and will identify novel and possibly more effective therapeutic targets in NMC and other cancers. In addition, we predict that BRD4-NUT megadomains will provide a model with far- reaching impact on the structure-function relationship of chromatin conformation in cancer and development.

We aim to understand mechanisms underlying oncogenic signaling and drug resistance in melanoma in order to improve the current treatment options. The serine/threonine kinase, BRAF, is somatically mutated in ~50% of melanomas and drives hyper-activation of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling, aberrant growth and invasion. While BRAF and MEK inhibitors are now first-line therapy for advanced-stage mutant V600E BRAF melanomas, they only delay mortality. Thus, we must understand how to build on BRAF+MEK inhibitor treatments and determine how to combine them with immune checkpoint agents, which remove the blocks on T cell action. In the previous cycle of this grant, we showed that up-regulation of FOXD3- ErbB3 signaling is an adaptive response to BRAF inhibitors that promotes a state of drug tolerance in mutant BRAF melanoma. Furthermore, we showed that inhibition of ErbB3 enhanced the effects of BRAF inhibitors in mutant BRAF melanomas in vivo. In this current proposal, we aim to identify mechanisms regulating FOXD3 in mutant BRAF melanomas, test the possibility that epigenetic BET/BRD inhibitors will block adaptive responses to BRAF+MEK inhibitors and alter the tumor microenvironment, and determine how FOXD3 expression alters the infiltration/activation status of tumor-associated immune cell populations and the expression of putative immune checkpoint proteins. At the completion of our experiments, we expect to have identified tumor and stromal markers for adaptive responses to targeted therapy and informed future combinatorial targeted inhibitor, epigenetic inhibitor and immune-based therapeutic strategies in mutant BRAF melanoma.

project	2R01CA163915-06	R01CA163915	9238289	2017	ATP-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling in Human Malignancy	Grant	ABSTRACT Recent exome sequencing studies have found that over 20% of human cancers have deleterious mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of mSWI/SNF (BAF) complexes. A much larger number of tumors have amplifications or deletions of these genes. These complexes are polymorphic assemblies of 15 subunits encoded by 28 genes giving rise to remarkable combinatorial specificity. This biologic specificity is reflected in the highly selective pattern of oncogenic mutations in specific subunits in specific cancers. Cancer mutations generally have the characteristics of tumor suppressors and are generally heterozygous, implying that they play a genetically dominant role in suppressing tumor formation. Work in our lab and others has led to the conclusion that the ability of these complexes to oppose polycomb-mediated repression contributes to their roles in both development and oncogenesis. Hence, we will focus our work on the mechanisms underlying the opposition between BAF and polycomb and its therapeutic consequences. First we will use a novel, newly designed in vivo chromatin remodeling assay to fully characterize the nature of the opposition on a minute-by- minute basis. Secondly, we will define the energetic requirements for BAF-polycomb opposition and the essential role of ATP in regulating binding and release of PRC1 from BAF. Third, we will fully characterize the direct interaction between BAF and polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in terms of subunits and domains that are essential for this interaction. Fourth, we will explore the consequences of disruption of BAF-polycomb opposition for repair, recombination and transcription over the genome. Finally, we will define the therapeutic potential of a group of small molecule BAF inhibitors that we identified in earlier screens. At the conclusion of these studies we should have a mechanistic understanding of BAF-polycomb opposition and have explored at least two potential paths for the production of cancer-specific drugs. 	ATPase Domain;Amino Acids;Binding;Biological Assay;Characteristics;Chromatin;Complex;Dependence;Development;Gene Deletion;Genes;Genetic Recombination;Genetic Transcription;Genetic study;Genome;Grant;Human;Human Genetics;Investigation;Kinetics;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Missense Mutation;Molecular;Mutation;Nature;Normal Cell;Oncogenic;PRC1 Protein;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Polycomb;Production;Proteins;Recurrence;Repression;Role;Specificity;Surface;System;Techniques;Therapeutic;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Work;base;cancer cell;chromatin remodeling;combinatorial;design;exome sequencing;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;novel;repaired;small molecule;tool;tumor;tumorigenesis	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	STANFORD	CA	UNITED STATES	Gerald R.

While the initial steps of the metastatic cascade are rather well defined, identification of targets to block this process remains a major clinical challenge. Previous studies have elegantly investigated the mechanistic contribution of tumor cell intrinsic properties that promote metastasis in bladder urothelial carcinomas. However, the functional significance of the tumor microenvironment and its contribution to this complicated process is not well characterized, and therefore, warrants investigation. The long-term goal of this renewal application is to continue explore how collagens—a major extracellular matrix component of the microenvironment—act as a ligand to mediate crosstalk with their receptor on tumor cells to facilitate the metastatic cascade. We will investigate the downstream regulatory mechanisms of collagen receptor signaling in both the primary tumor and metastatic sites, and to exploit these regulatory processes as a revolutionizing approach to target metastases. Such innovative approaches to perturb collagen-cancer crosstalk—not only at the primary tumor but also at the metastatic niche—will move the field forward by providing a new conception in metastatic disease management, and likely extend beyond bladder carcinomas to other cancer types.

Current treatment options are of limited effectiveness; thus, there is a pressing need for new therapies for this disease. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the histone methyltransferase DOT1L is required for the development and maintenance of MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemia in model systems. Likewise, work from the previous funding cycle clearly defined a role for DOT1L inhibition in MLL-r leukemia through characterization of a potent, specific DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ-5676 (pinometostat), that has remarkably selective anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on MLL-rearranged cells. As pinometostat has progressed through Phase I clinical trials, responses and subsequent relapses imply the development of acquired resistance to the inhibitor. In this proposal, we seek to understand the biological underpinnings of DOT1L inhibitor resistance and develop a novel class of small molecule DOT1L degraders to overcome resistance. In Specific Aim 1, we seek to understand the mechanisms of resistance through detailed studies of chromatin structure and gene expression following the development of acquired resistance to DOT1L inhibitor therapy. We will also investigate the non-enzymatic role of DOT1L in MLL-r leukemia and define dependencies acquired in the resistant state. In Specific Aim 2, we will lead a chemistry and chemical biology campaign and develop an assay platform for the identification and optimization of the first small molecule degraders of endogenous DOT1L protein. In Specific Aim 3, we will utilize our cell culture and patient-derived xenograft models of MLL-r leukemia to explore the impact of DOT1L degradation on gene expression and tumor progression while driving hit-to-lead optimization of DOT1L degraders that can prompt clinical investigation. We will also test pharmacological hypotheses regarding combinatorial drug action with DOT1L degraders in predictive human models of MLL-r leukemia. We expect these aims to bring new more efficacious, less toxic therapies to children and adults diagnosed with this devastating disease.

Resistance to chemotherapy is prevalent, and targets for molecular therapies are only beginning to be defined. For example, mutation of genes encoding transcription factors and epigenetic regulators cause most subtypes of AML, but their molecular pathophysiology and pharmacologic accessibility remain poorly defined. We have now found that leukemogenic gene expression in AML requires distinct molecular interactions between the pioneer transcription factor MYB and its coactivator CBP. Remarkably, peptidomimetic inhibitors of MYB transcriptional coactivation exhibit potent anti-leukemia activity in most molecular subtypes of AML while sparing healthy cells. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that defining and blocking the molecular mechanisms of aberrant transcriptional coactivation in AML will lead directly to improved therapies for patients. Aim 1 will define the molecular mechanisms of aberrant activation of leukemic MYB transcription factor complexes that control oncogenic gene expression. Aim 2 will pursue the preliminary evidence that peptidomimetic and targeted small molecule inhibitors can be used to dismantle leukemic transcriptional complexes in vivo and develop effective therapeutic strategies using accurate genetic and patient-derived preclinical mouse models. Successful completion of this project is expected to yield essential molecular mechanisms and effective therapies of aberrant transcription factors and gene control in AML, thus providing essential insights into a fundamental problem that remains poorly understood. This should have broad and lasting significance for understanding and treating refractory leukemias in particular and human cancer generally.

Uveal melanoma metastasizes in 40% of patients and upon metastasis targets the liver in 90% of these cases. The most common primary malignant liver cancer worldwide is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The use of blind liver biopsy as a diagnostic tool for liver cancer has many limitations including risks associated with the procedure and sampling bias and it cannot be performed repeatedly for longitudinal studies. Improving noninvasive imaging methodology would be a significant advance in early detection of small primary cancers and liver metastases for precision medicine. There is a critical need to develop MRI contrast agents capable of detecting primary and metastatic liver cancers earlier in their development than currently possible, and to provide insight into the biology of metastases through biomarkers for precision treatment. We have successfully met all of the proposed aims and milestones for Phase I. The main commercial goal of Inlighta Biosciences is to develop novel imaging reagents for preclinical and clinical applications. Our concerted efforts in this Phase II application are directed towards non-invasive earlier detection of uveal melanoma liver metastasis using novel protein contrast agents ProCA32 and its variant with capability to molecular imaging biomarker chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), an important biomarker for cell migration and tumor metastasis. We will obtain essential data required for filing IND applications for both reagents leading to clinical translation. Aim 1 is to optimize and validate in vivo imaging capabilities of ProCA32s in tumor detection assessing in mice and monkey. We will also validate CXCR4 targeting and monitor CXCR4 expression levels in liver metastasis mouse models. Aim 2 is to perform the safety and toxicity profiles protein contrast agents required for IND by determining serum, cell and in vivo stability, PK/PD, toxicity, and immunogenicity. Success in our proposed studies will have immediate clinical implications in the diagnosis of liver metastasis from various cancers, primary liver cancer, and other liver diseases.

project	2R44CA199826-02A1	R44CA199826	9345822	2017	Commercialization of an MRI contrast agent for differential diagnosis of prostate cancer.	Grant	Abstract  Prostate cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and the second most cause of cancer death of men in the US. Current methods to assess prostate cancer risk combine prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening and random prostate biopsy. Unfortunately, this strategy fails to reveal the lesion’s location and does not accurately differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers. As a result, most patients will receive unnecessary active treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in order to avoid under treatment. Active treatment involves surgery or radiation, often causing long-term side effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel urgency. Thus, development of non-invasive and accurate diagnostic imaging technology to localize and differentiate high-risk prostate cancer offer a new tool to assist physicians in risk-stratification and decision making and to spare millions patients with low- risk cancer from unnecessary aggressive treatment.  The mission of Molecular Theranostics (fka Prostate Theranostics) is to commercialize a novel molecular imaging approach that targets an oncoprotein associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer cell stemness, angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. The oncoprotein has a high expression in the tumor extracellular matrix of high-risk prostate cancer, low in low-grade tumor, none in normal tissues. The goal of this project is to commercialize a safe and effective targeted contrast agent for accurate early detection, localization, and differential diagnosis of high-risk prostate cancer with MRI. In phase I, we have optimized and identified a lead targeted MRI contrast agent for clinical translation. All of the milestones in Phase I of the project have been achieved. The agent possesses the superior ability of robust specific contrast enhancement in high-risk prostate cancer, not in slow growing low-risk tumors in animal models, and has the potential to visualize and differentiate high-risk prostate cancers with MRI.  The objectives of this SBIR Phase II are to develop a lead formulation of the contrast agent, to perform FDA required eIND enabling studies, and to commercialize the agent for clinical imaging prostate cancer. The specific aims are 1) to scale up the synthesis of the targeted contrast agent and develop a lead product formulation for pre-clinical study and clinical trials; 2) to validate the effectiveness of the formulation for prostate cancer imaging on a clinical MRI scanner and to determine its minimally effective dose; 3) to perform eIND-enabling pharmacokinetics and safety studies in rodents. Non-invasive accurate detection of prostate cancer is an unmet clinical need for prostate cancer management. Clinical trials will be initiated as soon as the eIND is approved by the FDA. Successful development of our imaging technology has the potential to accurately detect, localize, and diagnose prostate cancer, replace invasive prostate biopsy, and improve decision-making in clinical management of prostate cancer. It also has the potential for non-invasive active surveillance of prostate cancer and timely monitoring of disease progression, as well as image-guided therapy.

project	2R44CA216539-02	R44CA216539	9315636	2017	A Novel PET Probe for Use in Cancer Diagnostics	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that utilizes radiolabeled molecules (“probes”) to target and measure biological processes. Researchers can use the same probes to examine microorganisms, cells, and mice as they do in patients to visualize and characterize the biology of disease, monitor its progression, and evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Over 4000+ PET probes have been developed to help answer a variety of biological questions, but only the glucose analog [18F]FDG is routinely used for molecular imaging diagnostics in patient care. There is still an unmet need to develop additional probes which can annotate other key aspects of cancer biochemistry, including those in which the diagnostics share common targets with drugs, to truly establish it as a key technology for realizing improved treatment and monitoring in personalized medicine. The clinical translation of next generation PET probes is hampered by a lack of multi-site infrastructure to robustly, reliably, and cost-effectively support their supply to fulfill the initial data generation required to determine safety and efficacy in humans. This is often a key issue in bridging the “gap” between proof-of-concept research and FDA approval; Pharma and Biotech, who face increasing pressure to use diagnostics to develop drugs more efficiently, require significant validation studies and a reliable supply to realize the value of a novel PET probe to their clinical program and invest in future studies. Thus, early clinical studies in this gap are currently relegated to single-site production, or must undergo a cost- and-time-prohibitive assimilation into a commercial radiopharmacy before they've been clinically vetted. To facilitate a paradigm shift in the enablement of novel PET probes for the clinical trial community, a fundamental change in production ideology and infrastructure re-imagining is required. Creating a network of academic radiochemistry cores that standardize and share synthesis, purification, formulation, and quality control protocols through automation and cloud-based applications for clinical production serves to reduce barriers to translating PET probes from the preclinical research environment to first-in-human studies, as well enable rapid dissemination of PET probes across multiple sites to spur and de-risk academic and industry collaboration. The overall goal of this proposal is to establish and deploy a novel, low cost, scalable approach to the clinical translation of a next generation PET probes for cancer, starting with candidate probe [18F]CFA, with potential commercialization as a predictive response biomarker for cancer immunotherapies in solid tumors (i.e. CTLA-4/PD1 blockade), a pharmacodynamic biomarker for dCK inhibitors, and a predictive response biomarker for chemotherapy nucleoside prodrugs.

project	2U01CA164973-06	U01CA164973	9385642	2017	Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study	Grant	This renewal application seeks support for the infrastructure of the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study, which was established in Hawaii and southern California in 1993-1996 to study risk factors for cancer and other chronic diseases. The study was designed to take advantage of the ethnic and cultural diversity of the two geographic areas, as well as the expertise of the investigators in nutrition, ethnic/racial studies, and genetics. It is the most ethnically diverse cancer cohort in existence. It achieves high cost-efficiency by supplementing active follow-up information with computerized linkages to SEER, vital statistics, hospital-discharge diagnoses, medical claim data, electronic medical records and geospatial information. At baseline, the cohort included information on 215,000 men and women, comprised almost entirely of five ethnic/racial populations: Caucasians, Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, African Americans, and Latinos. The resource was later expanded to include a prospective biorepository of blood and urine specimens from ~70,000 of the participants. Leadership of the MEC entails a highly interactive, team approach; and the investigators have amply demonstrated their willingness to share data/samples, and to participate actively in consortia. This application describes our aims over the next 5 years for maintaining and enhancing the infrastructure of the MEC, as well as plans for methodological research. Research accomplishments include significant contributions to understanding both genetic and environmental risk factors for cancer. Over 280 papers describing our findings have been published during the current grant cycle. In addition, over the last 20 years, 98 research grants have been built around the MEC, and more than 75 students and postdoctoral fellows have been trained on the study. This grant renewal will make possible the continuation of a well-integrated program of research aimed at evaluating environmental and genetic risk factors for cancer and other common chronic diseases, taking advantage of new approaches, such as genomics, microbiomics, adductomics and metabolomics. The MEC will allow the testing of innovative research hypotheses aimed at ensuring that progress in prevention applies to major US ethnic/racial minorities.

project	2U24CA180803-06	U24CA180803	9627002	2019	Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) Group	Grant	The primary objective of the Imaging and Radiation Oncology (IROC) Group is to provide scientific and technical expertise for incorporation of appropriate, integrated quality Assurance (QA) and image data management for both imaging and radiotherapy (RT) in applicable trials conducted by the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Program and other NCI funded clinical trial groups (NCORP and ETCTN). The physical IROC QA Centers are distributed in 4 main locations and are administratively organized through the American College of Radiology (ACR). The QA Centers include IROC Houston, IROC Ohio, IROC Rhode Island, and IROC Philadelphia. The Advanced Technology QA Center (ATC) located at Washington University, St. Louis will provide their expertise and consultation services to IROC as needed. IROC capitalizes on existing infrastructure and expertise at QA centers currently providing services to the NCI’s clinical trial programs. Work flows, processes and information systems have been enhanced taking into account the best practices and standards in an integrated vision across NCI’s clinical trials. The interdependencies between imaging and RT are synergized eliminating duplication of services and optimizing efficient and effective workflows. A major strength of IROC is the development of consistent standard operating procedures for all imaging and RT aspects of the NCTN, NCORP and ETCTN (NCI Groups) and to facilitate a seamless flow of imaging and RT patient case datasets across the networks. IROC’s organizational structure allows the delivery of a broad array of imaging and RT QA services including Site Qualification; Trial Design Support; Credentialing; Data Management (Pre- and Post-treatment Case Review); and Case Review. An information technology infrastructure is used that harmonizes IROC services, data collection, assessment and management for the NCI Groups’ clinical trials. IROC implements programs that assure consistent high quality imaging and RT planning/delivery across the NCTN participating sites. IROC members collaborate with the NCI, NCI Groups, and disease/modality committees within each Network Group to provide an optimum and effective imaging and RT core service. The IROC Group will analyze QA data obtained prospectively/retrospectively and the correlation it might have with clinical trial outcomes to better determine and prioritize appropriate QA activities that maximize their benefit to clinical trials.

project	2U24CA180996-07	U24CA180996	9722332	2019	Cancer Genomics: Integrative and Salable Solutions in R/Bioconductor	Grant	Abstract Bioconductor is an ecosystem of more than 1,500 open-source software and data packages for the statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is widely used by the cancer genomics research community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core data classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and efficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell assays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of DNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a single specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the data. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to meet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of single-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant prioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of experimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create provenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in prioritization. Third, we develop scalable infrastructure for the curation, distribution, maintenance, discoverability, and usability of cancer data resources within and externally to Bioconductor. Finally, we develop a program of user training and new outreach approaches to support adoption of advanced Bioconductor infrastructure by developers of new cancer-related packages and existing packages critical to the cancer research community.

project	2UM1CA154967-07	UM1CA154967	9452526	2017	Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network Central Operations and Statistical Center	Grant	Project Summary The Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN) came about from discussions at the 2007 NCI Immunotherapy Agent Workshop, in which high-priority agents were identified that showed the potential to benefit patients with cancer—but that were not yet broadly available for investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Since 2007, a sea change has occurred in the field of cancer immunotherapy, resulting from the success of anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1. However, most of the priority agents identified in the NCI Workshop are still not broadly available for academic IITs. Since the original award in 2011, the CITN focused on testing these high-priority agents, including 5 of the top 8 ranked agents that hit targets critical for optimal immune responses. CITN trials are among the few academic IITs of these agents, and each trial has defined biologic and therapeutic principles. Two trials have led to changes in clinical practice. The abbreviated Specific Aims for the CITN are as follows: Aim 1: (a) to continue to conduct innovative early phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for adult cancers using high-priority immunomodulatory agents; (b) to form a Pediatric CITN (PedCITN) to conduct innovative early phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for pediatric cancers using high-priority immunomodulatory agents; (c) to provide leadership, infrastructure, and statistical support for the conduct of these clinical trials; (d) to continue to access high-priority agents central to immune responses and not broadly available for IITs Aim 2: to coordinate studies with Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) and other labs for specimen analysis (immune monitoring, biomarker credentialing) of adult and pediatric patients on CITN trials Scientific Goals of the CITN 1. Continue trials with T cell and natural killer cell activator and growth factor IL-15, homeostatic T cell growth  factor IL-7, dendritic cell activator anti-CD40, dendritic cell growth factor Flt3L, and IDO inhibitor ± anti-PD1 2. Continue trials with anti-PD1 for orphan and ultra-orphan indications, including pediatric cancers 3. Conduct biopsy-intense trials to identify actionable causes of anti-PD1 failure and linked to therapeutic  administration of potential rescue agents 4. Conduct trials to assess therapies that eliminate or activate the myeloid, monocytes/macrophage, and/or  myeloid-derived suppressor cells that reside within most cancers 5. Conduct multicenter Phase I and early Phase II immunotherapy trials for pediatric patients with cancer The results will inform future trial designs and improve the understanding of these high-priority agents. CITN trials are designed to identify paths to regulatory approval and will likely change standard practice or spur confirmatory pivotal trials by NCI cooperative groups and industry for adult and pediatric cancers.

project	4R42CA228875-02	R42CA228875	9991023	2019	Targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells with custom-designed viral vectors	Grant	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of adult brain cancers with a median survival of <15 months despite aggressive standard chemoradiation. GBM are formed by GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) - a major contributor to tumor recurrence and a natural focus for therapeutic development. There are two main reasons responsible for treatment failure: 1) high intra- and inter-tumor cellular and molecular heterogeneity with multiple subclones possessing distinct genetic determinants; 2) GSCs exhibit multiple redundant signaling pathways requiring simultaneous targeting of overlapping pathways. We have invented and biologically validated a novel tandem computational platform, GeneRep-nSCORE that integrates large-scale gene expression profiles with genomic changes to identify common founding alterations or master regulators of GSCs that span a large number, if not all, GSC subclones within and across GBM tumors. We discovered such a core set of four common master regulators in GCSs that are outstanding targets for clinical development. Expression of these four factors was sufficient to reprogram normal astrocytes to GSCs, whereas their depletion profoundly abrogated GSCs, and thus tumor development in vivo, in all eight lines of patient-derived GSCs of varied genetic and molecular backgrounds examined to date. The goal of this application is to develop a customized set of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based genetic tools to target the whole spectrum of GSCs (Phase I) for the purpose of delivering targeting constructs to deplete the four common master regulators responsible for malignant transformation and proliferation in GSCs (Phase II). The specific objectives of this proposal are: (i) using directed evolution and available combinatorial AAV capsid library, and for the first time, introducing a dynamic mode of administration of a library reagent over the time course of tumor progression, to greatly increase the probability of identifying novel AAV variants specifically targeting slow-, and fast-cycling GSCs in patient-derived xenograft models (PDX) (Phase I); (ii) To design and validate a panel of AAV vectors that express shRNAs targeting core master regulators of GSCs to identify leads for preclinical testing; (iii) To optimize modes of viral delivery, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters, and safety and toxicity in normal and PDX treated with lead targeting AAV cassettes; and (iv) Based on these results, tools and basic DMPK data created, to conduct preclinical efficacy studies in PDX treated with lead targeting AAV cassettes either alone or in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy (Phase II) to prepare for an investigative new drug application for clinical testing in patients with GBM, and for commercial development of this novel technology.

project	4R44CA217528-02	R44CA217528	9777221	2018	Novel Fluorescent Diagnostic Agents for Detection, Staging, andIntraoperative Imaging of Tumors	Grant	Abstract The goal of this project is to develop IV injectable fluorescent agents for use in intraoperative imaging of peritoneal metastatic tumors. Significance: Peritoneal metastatic cancers have an incidence of 250,000/per year in the US and are primarily treated with surgery. Complete surgical tumor resection is a gold-standard treatment goal that can increase the 5-year patient survival to 50%, whereas incomplete tumor resection (<2mm) could drastically reduce the survival to a mere few months. Current clinical imaging technologies such as PET, MRI and CT have limitations for guiding cancer surgery including inability to be used intraoperatively due to safety associated with ionizing radiation, as well as limitations on sensitivity and tumor specificity especially for lesions smaller than 10mm. Conventional fluorescent molecular probes in development typically target tumor proteins and are limited in imaging the heterogeneous onco-geno-phenotypes of peritoneal metastasis that have multiple tissues of origin and vary in protein expression levels. In order to reduce incomplete tumor resection and improve survival, there is an urgent need for clear visual contrast imaging agents that enable more precise and specific detection of peritoneal metastasis tumors intraoperatively and in real-time. Hypothesis: OncoNano’s approach of targeting tumor acidosis which is ubiquitously expressed as a cancer biomarker across tumors, coupled with OncoNano’s ultra-sensitive pH fluorescent digital sensors, provides a broad based approach to image the heterogeneous peritoneal metastasis with high specificity and sensitivity. Preliminary Data: We have demonstrated that OncoNano’s fluorescent agents image tumors across a variety of solid tumor types (14 tested to date), including peritoneal metastasis to submillimeter precision in SCID mouse models. OncoNano’s agents provided a digital (ON-OFF) response which offered clear tumor delineation, and lower detection limits (>10x) compared with state of the art PET-FDG imaging. Surgical tumor resection using OncoNano imaging agent showed significant (40-50%) survival benefit in SCID mouse models compared with conventional white light based surgery. Specific Aims: The scientific aims of this project will enable OncoNano to clinically translate, the ultrasensitive pH probes and develop it from the lab bench through to establishing reproducible manufacturing of a stable formulation, to establishing safety and pharmacology, for an FDA IND filing. The specific aims in the SBIR Phase I, addresses the nanoprobe stability requirement, and addresses the nanoprobe sensitivity and specificity requirement in in-vivo models. The specific aims in Phase 2 of the project addresses the critical milestones on the path to clinical translation including- the scale-up requirement to meet the GLP and human testing needs, a demonstration of product safety in GLP in-vivo studies, culminating in an IND filing with the FDA.

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie “microtumors”) and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.

project	4U01CA224146-02	U01CA224146	10242454	2020	Systematic interrogation of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment in patient-derived specimens	Grant	Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 8%. Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional evaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to investigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and improve immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in PDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME and identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating disease.

project	4U01CA224151-02	U01CA224151	10247895	2020	Canine Immuno Neurotherapeutics	Grant	ABSTRACT: The dog is an ideal large animal model for diagnostic and therapeutic studies and can be used to translate successes to human patients while providing compassionate care to animals and advancing the field of veterinary medicine. Pet dogs share their environment, and oftentimes their diet, with their owners. Dogs and humans develop sporadic benign and malignant brain tumors at about the same rate and with similar histopathology. Dogs are often euthanized due to the cost of care. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people as well as pets through comparative oncology and genomics and the “One Medicine” approach to research and direct clinical application. We propose a multi-institutional consortium to test an innovative combinatorial immunotherapeutic approach in dogs that spontaneously and sporadically develop malignant glial brain tumors that resemble in most important aspects, high-grade malignant gliomas in humans. Our approach will inject a clinical grade oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV) M032 that expresses human interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the resected tumor bed. Dog lymphocytes fully respond to human IL-12 [1] and oncolytic HSV infect and kill canine (as well as mouse, non-human primate, human) tumor cells, creating a potent local inflammatory response and an antigen-rich tumor cell debris field. Therefore, we would anticipate that this virally-based immunotherapeutic approach would likely be as effective in dogs with brain tumors as in humans with brain tumors. We will conduct longitudinal safety, survival and correlative biology evaluations as a means of assessing the dog as an appropriate and informative model for design and implementation of clinical studies in humans with high-grade malignant brain tumors. To extend these findings, we propose, in subsequent studies, to combine the HSV immunotherapy approach with molecules that block the action of innate checkpoint inhibitor(s). These studies are designed to address key issues of safety and efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy in the dog that can be translated to humans with malignant gliomas. Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in humans, accounting for 30% of all primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors in adults. [2] With few major advances in decades, there has been no significant reduction in mortality and only a modest improvement in median survival. Recently, objective responses and long-term survivals have been observed in human glioma patients who have received oncolytic virotherapy and a Phase I trial is currently underway at UAB in patients using M032 alone. New approaches to utilize checkpoint inhibitors promises improved efficacy, but the ability to develop more effective combinatorial approaches has been slow, in large part due to lack of a faithful model of spontaneous glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people and pets through comparative oncology and genomics using the “One Medicine“ approach to research and direct clinical application.

project	4U01CA224153-02	U01CA224153	10247897	2020	Enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy in DLBCL using rational combination approaches	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract While small molecule inhibitors have made an impact in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), immunotherapy, specifically using anti-CD20 based approaches, has had the most profound effect on treatment strategies and long-term outcomes. Despite this progress, up to 40% of patients will ultimately succumb to their disease. Furthermore, even when treatment is successful, cytotoxic chemotherapy carries a high risk of long- term morbidities that impact quality of life. The recent success of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of lymphoma demonstrates the potential for additional progress in long-term disease control of DLBCL, with less toxicity. The molecular and genetic phenotype of canine DLBCL has been studied and it often resembles the activated B cell (ABC) category typically associated with aggressive DLBCL in people. Moreover, there is now substantial data that specific genetic changes and pathway aberrations are conserved across dogs and people with DLBCL supporting the notion that the canine disease can be used as a relevant spontaneous large animal model of the human counterpart. Toward this end, the purpose of this proposal is to use dogs with spontaneous naïve DLBCL to rapidly evaluate rational small molecule/immunotherapy combination approaches, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most effective combination to move forward in human patients with DLBCL. Specifically, we hypothesize that optimal combinations of anti-CD20, anti- PD1, XPO1 inhibition, NAMPT/PAK4 and PI3Kdelta inhibition will have better outcomes than doxorubicin based chemotherapy, resulting in a “chemo-free” blueprint for future human trials. Using an adaptive mini-pilot trial approach, those combinations deemed antagonistic and/or associated with unacceptable adverse events can be rapidly removed from consideration, while those with clear therapeutic promise can be most effectively studied in the front-line setting and enhanced. We will accomplish this by first determining the optimal chemo-free regimen with small molecule/ anti-CD20 combinations, then identifying the optimal chemo-free regimen with small molecule/anti-PD1 combinations and finally, by evaluating a frontline chemo-free novel combination regimen in canine DLBCL to demonstrate superiority to standard R-CHOP-based chemotherapy. Additionally, we will interrogate correlative biomarkers based on RNA sequencing of tumor samples obtained from dogs enrolled into the prospective trials and develop signatures that can be used to predict not only response to therapy, but more importantly long-term progression-free survival. Together, the data generated from this proposal will create a framework for effectively leveraging information gained from integrated immunotherapeutic trials in canine patients with DLBCL to develop chemo-free strategies that ultimately improve human outcomes.

In the field of immunotherapy, dogs offer an innovative model for translational research, as they present many of the challenges faced in “scaling up” therapeutic systems dependent on complex interactions between multiple cell types yet under more controlled settings. They also allow for long-term assessment of efficacy and toxicities. Canine clinical trials offer unique access to a rich source of spontaneously occurring, genetically and immunologically diverse cancers with the benefits of reduced time, expense, and regulatory hurdles of a human trial. The similarities between canine and human cancers are increasingly being realized. The publicly available canine genome has propelled comparative genomics studies that have shown significant homology between dogs and humans for recognized cancer-associated genes including MET, IGF1R, mTOR, and KIT. Not surprisingly, cytogenetic abnormalities that define human cancers, i.e. BCR-Abl translocations in chronic myelogenous leukemia and RB1 deletions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been found in comparable canine cancers. Intracranial neoplasia occurs frequently in dogs with a reported prevalence from 0.15 to 4.5% compared to 18.2 cases per 100,000 human. Astrocytoma or glioma account for 20-36% of primary brain tumors in dogs and 25% in humans. Brachycephalic breeds such as Boxers, French and English bulldogs, and Boston terriers have a significantly increased risk of developing gliomas. Primary canine brain tumors have similar histologic classification as those reported by the World Health Organization for human brain tumors. Similar to that in humans, the prognosis for dogs with brain tumors in general is poor regardless of therapeutic intervention. However, much less is known about canine glioma treatment outcomes because only a small number of studies with few dogs have been reported. There is little information about median survival time for dogs with glioma that received any type of treatment, but estimates of days to 2 or 3 months are often given to owners. The clinical similarities between dogs and humans suggest that dogs may represent an outstanding model for testing targeted therapies; both dogs and humans might benefit from these studies. Herein, we are proposing a multi-pronged immunotherapeutic approach to improve efficacy and survival times. We hypothesize that combination immunotherapy in a canine glioma model will enhance efficacy and accelerate successful translation into phase I human trials for GBM. The objective is to use pet dogs with spontaneous GBM to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of combination immunotherapy. We propose two Specific Aims: 1. Determine the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in spontaneous canine GBM in combination with standard of care, and 2. Assess the efficacy of immune-mediated gene therapy in combination with CD200 blockade to enhance anti-glioma immunotherapy.

project	4U01CA224166-02	U01CA224166	10247896	2020	Enhancing natural killer immunotherapy with first-in-dog trials of inhaled recombinant IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15 in naturally occurring canine cancers	Grant	Project Summary This proposal seeks to build on our extensive preliminary data in canine immunotherapy trials to demonstrate that novel methods of exogenous cytokine delivery in combination with autologous natural killer (NK) cells in first-in-dog clinical trials represents a potentially high impact approach to optimize non-T cell based immunotherapies. This work is targeted to dogs with typically lethal, naturally occurring osteosarcoma (OSA) and melanoma, and the findings are expected to have important relevance for the design and translation of innovative immunotherapy approaches in humans. Inhaled (IH) IL-15 offers the advantages of local delivery of this immune-stimulatory cytokine, while limiting systemic exposure and thus potential toxicity. Super-agonist IL- 15 offers increased half-life and greater anti-tumor effects. Therefore, each of these cytokines is anticipated to alter the risk/benefit ratio in favor of their use. To accomplish these objectives, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) Targeting gross pulmonary metastases (OSA and melanoma) with first-in-dog delivery of inhaled (IH) human IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15; 2) Phase II trial of IH IL-15 and autologous NK cells to treat gross OSA and melanoma pulmonary metastases, and; 3) Targeting micro-metastatic disease using super- agonist IL-15 in primary OSA. The canine model represents a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy research as an important link between murine models and human clinical studies. Dogs represent an attractive outbred combination of companion animals that experience spontaneous cancer development in the setting of an intact immune system. Importantly, these studies are designed to evaluate novel treatment combinations for advanced pulmonary metastases in the setting of gross disease, but also will determine the impact of this approach as first-line therapy when combined with standard-of-care treatments. Moreover, this work seeks to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate an anti-tumor response (or non-response) in dogs with naturally occurring cancers. We will have the unique opportunity to perform whole exome sequencing and RNASeq on tumor tissue pre- and post-immunotherapy, and we will investigate whether a signature of mutational landscape and gene expression profiles can be developed to prospectively predict outcome and response to immune therapies. We will correlate these data to immunohistochemical, flow cytometry, and serum cytokine readouts for evidence of transition from “cold” to “hot” tumors predictive of favorable long term outcome. Hence, these canine trials and bio-marker studies represent an ideal strategy to inform and facilitate the rapid translation of novel, potentially high impact immune therapies to human patients with aggressive cancers.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies – a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study. This initiative is directly relevant to the primary objective to develop novel biomarkers and T cell antigenic targets for the successful application of immunotherapy in PDAC.

Indeed, canine OS has historically been used to help develop novel limb spare techniques, evaluate a variety of non-specific immunotherapeutics such as L-MTP-PE, and assess the efficacy of targeted therapeutics to prevent the outgrowth of metastatic disease. Despite best efforts, progress in the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease has essentially stalled for the past 3 decades; 30% of people and 90% of dogs still die of tumor spread, primarily to the lungs. Numerous clinical trials have been undertaken in people with macroscopic metastases and in dogs with both microscopic and macroscopic disease, yet all have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes. This is particularly evident with respect to immune checkpoint inhibitors that do not induce the dramatic disease regressions typically observed in other cancers such as melanoma and lung cancer. One particularly daunting challenge for immunotherapy-based therapeutics in OS relates to the permissiveness of the tumor microenvironment (TME) for inducing anti-tumor immune responses. Our data suggests that a relatively low mutational load combined with a dampened overall immune response in OS may contribute to the observed lack of response to current treatment approaches. We propose that targeting the immune suppressive TME in OS is essential to generating potent and durable anti- tumor immunity. To accomplish this, it may be necessary to simultaneously modulate several elements in the TME, including Tregs, MDSCs, M2 macrophages and overexpressed inhibitory checkpoint molecules. In support of this, we have generated a body of data demonstrating immunological activity of multiple therapeutics, including repurposed drugs with good safety records (losartan, oclacitinib), small molecule inhibitors with established PK/PD in dogs (toceranib, RV1001, reparixin, JHU-292) and antibodies specific for checkpoint molecules (anti- PD1). However, the exact combinations that are most effective against metastatic OS have not yet been identified, and this is a major goal of this proposal. As such, we hypothesize that an adaptive pilot trial design can be used to rapidly screen TME-targeting immunotherapy drug combinations in dogs with macroscopic chemotherapy-resistant metastatic OS and that this information can be refined to assess activity of the most active approach against microscopic metastases in a subsequent adjuvant trial. This will be accomplished by testing four TME modifying immunotherapy combinations for anti-tumor and immune modulatory activity in dogs with macroscopic OS metastases, interrogating relevant biomarkers associated with responses to therapy, then using this information to conduct an adjuvant immunotherapy trial with the most active combination in dogs with microscopic metastatic OS. The data generated from this proposal will create a blueprint for future immunotherapy studies in people with OS by eliminating approaches deemed inactive and generating a set of clinical biomarkers to guide treatment.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).

project	4U01CA224348-02	U01CA224348	10242459	2020	Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy	Grant	We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan, can enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS 2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include “normalization” of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy – FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium. Through this work, we will develop innovative approaches to enhance anti-tumor immunity in this intractable disease.

project	4U24CA224020-02	U24CA224020	10242451	2020	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC)	Grant	ABSTRACT In contrast to the decline in mortality in other cancers, the incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is increasing, and therapeutic approaches, for the most part, have not been successful at improving survival in patients. Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 “Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME” was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central “hub” for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.

project	4U24CA224067-02	U24CA224067	9985279	2019	Data Coordination Center for PDX Net	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are a powerful model system for assessing drug efficacy of anti-cancer agents and understanding molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. However, results from individual research groups have been difficult to validate due to the lack of standardized PDX procedures, lack of scale for adequately powered PDX studies and the inability to efficiently share PDX specimens. A key contributor to this challenge is the lack of well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of integrated, standardized datasets from PDX models. The JAX-Seven Bridges PDX Data Commons and Coordination Center (PDCCC) seeks to address this challenge and unite the efforts of the component data- generating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI’s Patient-Derived Model Repository/PDMR) parts of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research Network (PDXNet) into a cohesive, trans-Network whole. Using innovative cloud computing and bioinformatic approaches, our PDCCC will provide administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX method standardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. We will build a data storage, sharing, and analysis platform that harmonizes PDXNet data with other large datasets and analysis workflows available in the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud. Simultaneously, we will administer planning meetings, training activities, and research pilots to build synergies within the PDXNet, enhancing the ability of the PDXNet to develop clinical trials from PDX studies. Our Specific Aims are to 1) establish a leadership and administration unit to manage and coordinate activities within PDXNet, including annual meetings, regular conference calls, training activities, trans-Network pilot projects, and outreach; 2) develop a cloud- integrated PDXnet Data Commons that integrates PDXNet data with the existing cloud-based data analysis platform - the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC); and 3) build analysis workflows and data sharing practices to optimize PDXNet research and enable PDXNet data to facilitate clinical trial design. To accomplish these Aims we have assembled a team with unique expertise in PDXs, cancer treatment, genomic analysis, data coordination, and project management from The Jackson Laboratory and Seven Bridges. Our combined institutional strengths include a history of leadership in (and commitment) to PDX, data resource, analytic and consensus standards development and application; practical expertise in PDX model sharing and collaborative community efforts; a broad array of statistical, bioinformatic, and software-related PDX resources; leadership expertise in large-scale, cloud-based biomedical data projects, notably the SB-CGC; and deep experience in high-performance database engineering and development. Our goal is to build an innovative, systematically organized PDCCC that will advance the efforts of PDXNet to improve the validity—and expand use—of the PDX system as a preclinical platform for precision oncology.

project	4U24CA224122-02	U24CA224122	10247892	2020	Coordinating Center for Canine Immunotherapy Trials and Correlative Studies	Grant	The primary mission of goal of the Pre-medical Cancer Immunotherapy Network for Canine Trials (PRECINCT) is to facilitate the performance of immunotherapy clinical trials in dogs with cancer and to expedite the identification of immunological correlates of successful therapeutic responses. The PRECINCT will achieve these goal by supporting a highly coordinated clinical trials network of participating U01 sites. As a coordinating center, the PRECINCT will work in consultation with U01 investigators, the Steering Committee, representatives from the Comparative Oncology Program (COP) at NCI and an External Advisory Committee to provide expert services in project management and research technology, data management, biostatistical support and immunological monitoring. Specifically, we will establish a PRECINCT Data Coordinating Center to provide comprehensive project oversight, supervise all project management and regulatory compliance activities, and coordinate site management for all aspects of single and large multi-site projects. Through the PRECINCT, U01 investigators will have ready access to research services and standardized protocols that will facilitate the performance of clinical research across the PRECINCT. We will establish a PRECINCT Data Management System to collect, store and share all clinical and correlative data amongst the U01 sites and with the COP directors and Steering Committee. We will develop the infrastructure necessary to achieve an efficient, highly functioning coordinated network and develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) that can be applied across all PRECINCT-associated U01 projects to ensure high quality, repeatable data sets. We will provide biostatistical support for study design and data analysis to ensure that immunotherapy clinical trials performed within the network are strategically designed and appropriately powered to achieve meaningful clinical and laboratory data results in the most expedite way. The renowned expertise of the University of Pennsylvania in both human and canine clinical trials will foster rapid translation of state-of-the art methods for human clinical study design and analysis to canine clinical trials and results from canine trials can rapidly inform human clinical trials, thus optimizing results for both species. Finally, the University of Pennsylvania is a leader in cancer immunotherapy and is also home to world renowned experts in immune reagent development and immunological monitoring. We will leverage this expertise to both accelerate the mission of the U24 and extend it by providing support for immunologic reagent development for use in correlative studies and biomarker identification. In concert with U01 investigators, the COP and the Steering Committee, we will design, generate and validate several multiparametric, multicolor flow panels and SOPs for their use across the U01 sites. Successful immunologic monitoring will allow canine cancer patients to be streamlined to single or combination therapies most likely to be effective and will provide essential insight for future translational application to human cancer patients.

Despite improvements in the clinical outcomes achieved with newer therapies, wide inter-individual variation in response to treatment is a major limitation in achieving consistent therapeutic effects, or cures. Not all patients respond to initial therapies (innate resistance), and those that do frequently relapse with refractory disease (acquired resistance). The central hypothesis we are addressing is that rational therapeutic development in MM should be based on an understanding of the underlying genetics and biology of the tumor that identify sensitivity and resistance to current and future drugs. In this Myeloma-DRSC we are proposing 3 Projects that will: 1) develop a high throughput drug screening platform for myeloma cell lines representing the wide diversity of MM biology; and use this platform to screen primary patient tumor cells for most effective responses, including combination therapies; 2) develop a comprehensive mutational and germline variation panel that will be correlated to drug responses in vitro and in vivo, as well as toxicities; 3) identify the mechanism of response and resistance for two of the most common therapeutics used in MM treatment: IMiDS and proteasome inhibitors; 4) develop genetic and immunophenotypic signatures that effectively predict tumor response, resistance, and patient toxicities; 5) identify tumor sub-populations that may contribute to emerging resistance; and 6) identify strategies to predict drug resistance and approaches to overcome resistance.

Treatment strategies for AML have not changed in 30-40 years. Single-agent targeted therapies based on AML genetics or microenvironmental disease features have been disappointing, at best. The investigators on this DRSC Program, Drug Combinations to Circumvent Resistance (D2CR), have collaborated for over a decade and have developed functional genomic pipelines for evaluation of primary AML patient samples that have collectively led to numerous discoveries with diagnostic and therapeutic implications. For this Program, our long-term goals are to translate effective drug combinations that target tumor- intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways into the clinic for patients with AML. Our immediate goals are to prioritize the most relevant tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways for each AML disease subset and establish sufficient preclinical data to facilitate immediate clinical investigation of drug combinations. Based on the central hypothesis that drug combinations targeting tumor intrinsic and extrinsic features of AML biology will be essential to the development of more effective and durable therapeutic strategies, we predict that the drug combinations established by this D2CR-DRSC Program will substantially improve outcomes for patients with AML. To accomplish these goals, 3 Projects are proposed: 1) What are the tumor-intrinsic genes and pathways that contribute to drug sensitivity and resistance? Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screens on parental and drug-resistant AML cells will be integrated with computational analysis of the largest functional genomic AML cohort in the world. The result will nominate genes/pathways for validation on patient samples in gene-edited models and for drug combination studies in Project 3. 2) What are the tumor-extrinsic pathways promoting tumor cell growth, drug resistance, and immune suppression? Inflammatory cytokine profiling of our large bank of AML patient samples will be conducted. Our bank of AML patient bone marrow stromal cells will also be accessed for studies of the reactive signature of these stromal cells when exposed to specific drugs. Finally, high-parameter immunophenotyping and T-cell functional assays will be used to define the immune landscape with candidate drugs tested in an immune-competent, spontaneous mouse model of AML. Candidate targets will be nominated for combination studies with tumor-intrinsic targets. 3) What are the drug combinations that most effectively bridge tumor- intrinsic and microenvironmental biology to eliminate AML cells and circumvent resistance? Drug combinations from targets nominated in Project 1 and 2 will be tested ex vivo on primary AML patient samples and in vivo using AML patient-derived xenografts. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a major impact on our understanding of AML biology, with successful clinical translation of new, more effective drug combination strategies.

project	4U54CA224065-02	U54CA224065	9985264	2019	University of Texas PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	SUMMARY Our overarching goal for the University Texas PDX Development and Trial Center (UTPDTC) is to optimize personalized biomarker-based cancer therapy and identify effective targeted drugs based on the molecular characteristics of each tumor. Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly- annotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The primary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single agents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs or combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets of tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other histologies. Over the past 9 years, both University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDACC) and The University of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) have established institution-wide efforts to generate novel PDX models and perform preclinical testing. Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX models of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases where there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We have characterized many tumor subtypes in our existing PDXs and plan to characterize many more with the ultimate goal of developing drug combinations in defined tumor subsets in a context that can lead to clinical trials which will validate the experimental results. We plan to focus on NCI-IND agents that are primarily used by the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network. The availability of hundreds of PDXs of diverse histologic types and molecular profiles provides a unique opportunity for synergistic interactions among the UTPDTC investigators, PDXNet, and ETCTN. Each Project will identify molecular subtypes and then test with drugs targeted to putative pathways. Similar molecular subtype profiles will be identified across projects and histologic classifications. This provides an opportunity to test the activity of drugs targeting specific molecular pathways that may be active in several histologically distinct subtypes. Such pan-histologic activity could greatly accelerate drug development. Our proposed studies focus on targeted therapeutic agents for treatment of diseases and/or molecular subtypes that have unmet medical needs. The proposed studies are highly relevant to public health, as their success will lead to effective precision therapy for cancers, for which current therapies are ineffective.

project	4U54CA224068-02	U54CA224068	9985249	2019	An integrated translational approach to overcome drug resistance	Grant	Drug resistance represents one of the most critical obstacles to clinical benefit for cancer patients. Due to the size and complexity of this challenge, we believe a collaborative team approach is critical and have assembled a team of drug resistance experts from three leading institutions (MGH, the Broad Institute, and MIT/Koch Institute) with an exceptional track record of impactful discoveries in this field. We propose an integrated full-spectrum translational platform—including liquid biopsy, patient-derived tumor models, exome and transcriptome sequencing of tumor tissue, rapid autopsy, functional genomic screens, innovative preclinical mouse models, and a high-throughput combination drug-screening platform covering the CTEP portfolio—to address critical principles of drug resistance across several major cancer types—lung, melanoma and GI cancers, which impact a large percentage of cancer patients. Overall, these three projects will focus on the common theme of bypass resistance mechanisms, a critical ad frequent mechanism of therapeutic resistance that can involve both genetic and adaptive resistance mechanisms that “bypass” the effects of therapy, and which can drive both intrinsic and acquired resistance. To maximize the potential impact on cancer patients we will focus projects on three major tumor types—lung, melanoma and GI cancers—with each project integrating at least two tumor types. We will focus our projects on defining and overcoming key bypass resistance mechanisms to three of the most critical classes of cancer therapeutics: MAPK inhibitors, RTK inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. While each project will focus on a specific therapy and at least two specific cancer types, we believe the overall program design can be readily applied to additional agents and molecularly-defined cancers, such that the ultimate impact of this work will go beyond the specific studies proposed and will serve as a “blueprint” for critical discoveries related to drug resistance. We anticipate that these efforts will define a new standard in our mechanistic understanding of bypass resistance mechanisms and will lead to novel opportunities to overcome them in the clinic. Our proposed approach will provide a steady stream of novel therapeutic strategies involving CTEP agents and pathways for evaluation in future clinical trials, as well as new potential agents for the CTEP portfolio. We have also integrated cutting-edge strategies for real-time blood-based monitoring of response and resistance to help guide innovative trial design.

project	4U54CA224070-02	U54CA224070	9985257	2019	Rational approaches to melanoma therapy	Grant	Project Summary – Overall The outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma have improved dramatically over the last decade due to an improved understanding of the molecular drivers of this disease. In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens have been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas. These treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof- of-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will progress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been shown to be effective in patients with a wild-type BRAF. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments that prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are effective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies, over the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical, histological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of >450 PDX models represents one of the largest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately recapituluates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also includes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been maintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a robust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we propose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued expansion of our robutst melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical gaps in this disease. Project 1 will characterize kinase inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the PI3K-AKT pathway in combination with approved targeted therapies in PDX models in treatment-naïve and drug- resistant BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanomas. Project 2 will characterize targeting the apoptotic machinery of cancer cells as a combinatorial approach with MAPK pathway inhibitors in PDX with and without BRAFV600E/K mutations, including in subsets with aberrancies in anti-apoptotic genes. Both Projects will utilize baseline characteristics of the PDX models to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to guide personalized patient selection for future clinical testing. In addition, tumors will be analyzed for treatment-induced effects that correlate with sensitivity to identified resistance mechanisms and potential new combinatorial strategies. Finally, markers identified in the preclinical models will be compared to parallel biomarker studies of metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in clinical trials utilizing the same agents. These studies will be supported by the PDX, Bioinformatics, and Administrative Cores to ensure their success, along with a Pilot Project program to open new areas of investigation. Together these studies will have high potential to translate into new personalized clinical trials for patients.

project	4U54CA224076-02	U54CA224076	9985272	2019	PDX Trial Center for Breast Cancer Therapy	Grant	Project Summary The scientific premise of this Center is that breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models represent the diversity of human breast tumors, and can be feasibly utilized to test new drugs and drug combinations to find therapeutic approaches that match with molecular features of various tumor types. The goal of our PDX Development and Trials Center (PDTC) is to obtain preclinical data that will facilitate prioritization of drugs to be tested in breast cancer clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Toward this goal, our PDTC focuses on testing drugs that are already available through the NCI as NCI-IND agents with the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). Scientifically, this PDTC will focus on preclinical evaluation of approved and investigational drugs and drug combinations in a large collection of breast PDX models representing primary and metastatic breast cancer. One project will screen 35 NCI-IND drugs as single agents and in combination with standard- of-care therapies, in >100 breast PDX models using a novel organoid system, and validate these responses in PDX-bearing mice. Another project will test therapies that are predicted to target tumor- initiating cell populations, with the goal of reducing chemotherapy resistance and recurrence – the major cause of death from breast cancer. These two synergistic research projects will be supported several key Cores: a PDX Core to propagate the PDX models and run the drug studies; a Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core to identify molecular features of tumors that do (or do not) respond to various treatments; a Pilot Projects and Trans-network Activities Core to foster exploration of new ideas within the PDTC and in collaboration with the PDXNetwork (PDXNet); and an Administrative Core to facilitate effective communication within the PDTC and with the PDXNet. Taken together, these elements will converge to reveal high-priority treatment strategies for future clinical trials in breast cancer patients.

project	4U54CA224079-02	U54CA224079	9985232	2019	The MSKCC-UW/Fred Hutch Prostate Cancer Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center	Grant	OVERALL ABSTRACT The lethal stage of metastatic prostate cancer, called castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), kills ~26,000 men per year in the US. Despite remarkable improvements in survival with next generation AR pathway inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, CRPC patients ultimately progress and die from their disease. Our understanding of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to AR therapy has increased dramatically in recent years, largely based on genomic landscape analyses of tumors from CRPC patients and preclinical studies of acquired resistance in patient-derived models (organoids, PDX). Much of this progress is directly linked to the members of this Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center (DRSC) team. A major mechanistic insight from these studies is the recognition of two categories of AR therapy resistance: one in which AR pathway signaling is restored and the other in which it remains inhibited. Underlying both categories are a heterogeneous set of resistance mechanisms, many of which were discovered by our DRSC team members. Importantly, we have shown that several of these resistance mechanisms can be targeted with current clinical grade drugs. The overarching goal of this DRSC proposal is to evaluate these translational opportunities across a unique set of preclinical organoid and PDX models (again, discovered and developed by our DRSC team members) and to catalyze the initiation of clinical studies in patients most likely to benefit based on appropriate biomarker profiles. We address this goal in three Projects. Project 1 focuses on resistance caused by restored AR pathway function, which occurs in over ~50% of CRPC patients, by targeting the glucocorticoid receptor, which is upregulated and substitutes for AR, or by further inhibition of AR signaling using drugs targeting specific components of the chromatin machinery. Project 2 will take a similar approach but will focus on the opposite category of acquired resistance (absence of restored AR pathway activity), leveraging insights from our recent data showing that cancer can revert from an AR-negative to AR-positive state by targeting specific chromatin modifiers. Project 3 integrates with Projects 1 and 2 by focusing on kinase inhibitors as an adjunct to AR pathway therapy in two distinct contexts – PI3K/AKT activation in tumors with PTEN loss and FGFR activation in tumors with autocrine FGF8/FGF9 production. Excitingly, a recent clinical trial of combined AKT and AR inhibition, which was initiated based on our earlier work, demonstrated a significant improvement in survival for patients with PTEN loss prostate cancer. The Administrative Core will oversee the integration of the Projects with each other, with NCI scientific staff and with other DRSCs. Collectively our studies will validate various combination therapy regimens, in conjunction with molecular biomarkers for patient selection, as a critical step toward clinical translation. In addition, the drugs and targets studied here are broadly relevant for multiple cancer types.

project	4U54CA224081-02	U54CA224081	9985245	2019	Bay Area Team Against Resistance	Grant	PROJECT ABSTRACT The proposed Bay Area Team Against Resistance U54 Project (BATAR-UP) is an interdisciplinary effort of investigators to apply their knowledge and expertise to dissect the molecular and cellular basis of incomplete response and resistance to current treatments and to identify new treatment strategies to better neutralize or eliminate residual disease and prevent resistance. This translational approach will be part of the NCI's Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Centers Network to develop innovative strategies to understand and combat mechanisms of tumor resistance and exploit tumor sensitivity to anti-cancer therapies.  To accomplish this, BATAR-UP will support two projects and one core driven by a multidisciplinary team of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University. Project 1 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of residual disease in lung cancers treated with targeted inhibitors in clinical use. We will prioritize for initial study both EGFR-mutant and ALK gene rearrangement positive lung cancers, given their importance as key molecular disease subtypes and our prior published work and expertise. We will harness genetic and transcriptomic analysis of clinical samples (liquid and tumor biopsies) to provide a molecular view of the evolution of response, residual disease, and acquired resistance. We will generate organoid and PDX models and apply cutting-edge functional screens (genetic, pharmacologic, and targeted proteomic assays) to identify key vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited, including with CTEP agents. This systematic approach will allow us to reveal the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that drives EGFR and ALK inhibitor resistance and pinpoint therapeutic strategies to intercept the evolution of residual disease and eventual acquired resistance. Project 2 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of resistance and residual disease in lung cancers treated with current immunotherapies, including PD-1 and PD- L1 antibodies. Leveraging shared platforms in synergy with Project 1, we will perform systematic analyses of liquid and tumor biopsy specimens (and ex vivo models) obtained from patients longitudinally before and during treatment and upon acquired resistance. We will focus our studies on EGFR and ALK wild type patients, including squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma patients where immunotherapy has shown efficacy but is typically non-curative. We will leverage (1) a novel lung cancer organoid model wherein tumor biopsies are cultured as both tumor epithelium and their endogenous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) en bloc as a cohesive unit, and (2) deep droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Our systematic approach will help define the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that contributes to immunotherapy resistance and identify potential new therapeutic strategies to help convert these incomplete responses into curative outcomes. Our Administrative Core will provide leadership, coordination and oversight for BATAR-UP with the overarching goal of synergizing the research conducted in the 2 Projects and the entire DRSC network.

project	4U54CA224083-02	U54CA224083	9985250	2019	Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	With the discovery of a number of new molecular targets and exponential increase in the number of anti-cancer agents, it has become imperative to optimize preclinical models in order to design rational clinical trials. Recognizing the unique advantage of the patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) models in drug testing and personalized medicine, physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the Siteman Cancer Center have been actively generating and utilizing PDX models for cancer research and the evaluation of molecularly targeted agents. Building on our strength and existing infrastructure, we propose to establish the Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center (WU-PDTC), as part of PDXNet program, to promote preclinical testing in a collaborative nation-wide effort. The PDX core within WU-PDTC will develop and characterize at least 1000 new pathogen-free PDX models across major tumor types. The PDX models will be genomically and phenotypically characterized using the latest ‘omics technologies and expertly analyzed using the most current data analysis pipelines that have been deployed for other large scale NCI programs. The Bioinformatics Core will integrate these analyzes with clinical annotation from the originating patient to include patient treatment history and tumor response (Aim 1). Our two research projects will conduct PDX clinical trials using single agent and combinational agents using drugs under NCI-IND (Aim 2). Project 1 will test pan- or beta isoform specific class I PI3K inhibitors in over 100 breast PDX models while Project 2 will study combinatorial approaches that overcome tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms to ERK inhibition in over 100 already available pancreatic PDX models. Proteogenomic and clinical response data will be collected in these models, as part of a broader effort of characterizing PDX models and conducting clinical correlation and treatment response analyses by the Bioinformatics Core (Aim 3). All relevant information, including proteogenomic features of PDX models and treatment/response history, will be tracked in a dedicated relational database that will be accessible to PDXNet and PDMR-FNLCR. The goal is to identify candidates for human clinical trials for the ET-CTN. In Aim 4, the WU-PDTC will leverage existing expertise and programs from the NCI-designated Comprehensive Siteman Cancer Center, Institute of Clinical and Translational Research (ITCS), McDonnell Genome Institute, Mallinkrodt Imaging Research Center, and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN) to support the goals of developing and utilizing PDX models to test and improve cancer treatment, in collaboration with other components of the PDXNet. Finally, WU-PDTC, through coordination by the Administration Core, will support pilot research projects utilizing the PDX resources and fostering collaboration across PDTCs, PNMR-FNLCR, and other NCI programs. The goal is to increase the spectrum of agents tested in PDX clinical trials and to improve the reliability, validation, utility, and standardization of PDX models through innovative Cross-PDXNet research.

project	4UH3CA202663-03	UH3CA202663	9756833	2018	Cytology-Free POC Cervical Cancer Diagnostics for Global Health	Grant	﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):HPV-associated cervical cancer is among the leading causes of death in women worldwide, with more 500,000 cases and 275,000 deaths annually. While repeated screening through frequent use of the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear has drastically reduced the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in developed nations, the vast majority of cervical cancer-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries with minimal healthcare infrastructure. Cytology-based prevention programs have proven to be extremely difficult to implement and sustain in low-resource settings, and as a result over 85% of new cervical cancer cases originate in developing countries. The lack of adequate infrastructure for traditional cytology-based screening combined with the presentation of cervical cancer, where symptoms are not present until the cancer is in an advanced stage, emphasize the clinical need for a screening test appropriate for low resource settings. Development of a reliable Point-of-Care (POC) test with high sensitivity and specificity has the ability to reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer worldwide. We propose to develop a novel nanotechnology- based diagnostic assay platform to detect cervical cancer progression in low-resource settings. This multiplex assay platform, which is currently being developed for non-oncology applications by Becton Dickinson (BD), is designed to be low-cost, easy to use, and inexpensive. We propose to adapt this platform to develop a highly specific diagnostic test that will screen women who do not need treatment and identify women with cervical lesions who need to be referred for colposcopy. The diagnostic test is based on Surfaced Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) technology, that enables detection of multiple targets in a complex sample without the need for washing or purification. The test and analysis is completed in less than 30 minutes, provides a "sample-in- answer-out" workflow, making the platform ideal for a "screen and treat" test in low-resource settings. Diagnostic development and validation will be done in close collaboration with a multidisciplinary team with expertise in HPV and cervical cancer screening as well as clinical oncology. By combining BD's experience in assay development, global healthcare delivery, and regulatory approval with the clinical expertise of other team members, the team has the expertise required to develop and validate a POC cervical cancer test for low resource settings. In addition to BD assay development, engineering, global healthcare delivery, and regulatory personnel, the team includes Dr. Jennifer S. Smith (UNC-Chapel Hill), Dr. Douglas Clark (UNM), Dr. Mark Stoler (UVA Health System), Dr. Scott McClelland (UW), and clinical validation site leaders including Dr. You-Lin Qiao (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences), Dr. Nelly Mugo (Kenya Medical Research Institute), Dr. Jose Fregnani (Barretos Cancer Hospital), and Dr. Adhemar Longatto-Filho (Barretos Cancer Hospital, Brazil).

project	4UH3CA233229-02	UH3CA233229	9997410	2019	ACCISIS-Chicago	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) not only detects disease early but also prevents cancer by finding and removing precancerous polyps. The overall goal of our project, Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-up through Implementation Science in Chicago (ACCSIS-Chicago), is to test a multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in Chicago, Illinois. In this project, we will include two different types of implementation strategies: 1) evidence-based multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care; and 2) implementation support strategies to support the implementation process that contribute to the adoption, implementation and sustainment of our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention. We will partner with 4 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which have 35 clinics in the Chicago area and provided primary care service to nearly 188,000 racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in 2016. During the UG3 Planning-Exploratory Phase, we will work with one of the 4 FQHC partners to pilot test, measure, and refine our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention in preparation for the experimental trial in the UH3 Implementation Phase, as well as assess the effectiveness of our implementation support strategies. In the UH3 Implementation Phase, we will use a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and impact of our multilevel, multicomponent intervention on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care across our 4 partner FQHCs. The selection of our intervention components will be based on intensive literature review, and findings and lessons learned from our previous studies and projects. Our multilevel intervention components will include EMR provider reminders, provider assessment and feedback, patient navigation, provider education and community outreach. We will also test one local innovation, IL ColonCARES, during the UGH Phase to increase the rate of follow-up after a positive stool test among uninsured patients by linking uninsured patients with specialty services. We expect the finding from this study to have broad impact on understanding the implementation process to increase colorectal cancer screening, follow up, and referral to care across diverse health systems.

In North Carolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions. Community health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable populations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%. Substantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and system-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening targets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based screening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase screening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to systematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for uninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from stakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We hypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective approaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through improved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research, implementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central hypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based interventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable. The specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot studies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a process for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2 (Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening approaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess implementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the multilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This project is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation modeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact on CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities.

project	4UH3CA233282-02	UH3CA233282	9997414	2019	(ACCSIS) Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia	Grant	Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia This multi-site project aims to increase screening and follow-up for colorectal cancer (CRC) in central Appalachia, a medically underserved region recognized as one of three distinct “hotspots” for CRC mortality. Specifically, the Appalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern Kentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the area are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents screened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence on CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with Appalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention and control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted from evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the community (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in 12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base for a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically underserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden of CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test, measure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH and Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI approval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI in a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2) Assess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with community and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to early or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined by US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county- level behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating Center, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community partners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia.

Grant	ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends CRC screening through a variety of invasive and non- invasive tests for individuals aged 50 to 75 years. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and other strategies exist to promote CRC screening, but adoption and implementation of these are limited, especially in CHCs. Our hypothesis is that a Hub and Spoke multilevel intervention will be superior to usual care. The hub will be Health Quality Partners of Southern California (HQP), a non-profit organization comprised of 16 CHC systems (spokes), serving 135 rural and urban clinic sites. We propose a 2-phase study to pilot and optimize (Phase I) and rigorously test (Phase II) the Hub and Spoke approach and its impact on CRC screening, follow-up, and usual care. UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed methods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients served by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and coordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3 Implementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a regionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness of the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post implementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3) proportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and sustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods approach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM constructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e. patients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and Sustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of Implementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate progress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are scalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.

Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up colonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage partnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest Center for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation support to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate working with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics (reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients). In Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a large-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor supported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never been screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to support follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and recruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the training and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings. In Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi- experimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice facilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan- vendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never been screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred for colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will evaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and qualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program through partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care clinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model.

Among patients with NF1, loss of the non-mutant allele of NF1 in a rare Schwann cell or precursor, along with other ill-defined factors, leads to benign dermal or plexiform neurofibromas. The main cause of death among NF1 patients is the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most likely develops from plexiform neurofibroma, in particular the so-called “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma. Approximately half of MPNSTs are NF1-associated, and NF1 patients have 10-15% lifetime risk of developing this terrible cancer. MPNSTs metastasize early and are often resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main treatment for MPNSTs is surgical resection but, despite radical excision with wide surgical margins, followed by chemoradiation, 5-year survival rates are poor due to metastases as well as local recurrence. NF1 patients could greatly benefit from prophylactic vaccination that would prevent the malignant transformation of benign plexiform neurofibromas into “atypical” plexiform neurofibromas and to MPNSTs. We aim to determine if the mutations that govern the development of “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma (NF1 loss followed by CDKN2A loss) and MPSNT (NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12 loss) lead to the expression of recurrent alternately processed transcripts, such as transcriptionally-induced chimeras, that could express neoantigens and be used as targets for prophylactic vaccines. Such transcripts can be translated to produce novel peptides downstream of frameshift mutations caused by coding exon read-through into introns, mis-splicing from a coding exon to a non-canonical splice acceptors or splice acceptors in other genes. In most cases, a premature termination codon (PTC) will be rapidly encountered by the ribosome translating such transcripts. Therefore, we furthermore hypothesize that these alternately processed transcripts can express what we call “cryptic” neoantigens when treated with drugs that suppress utilization of premature codons such as Ataluren or gentamycin. In such a way, we could administer a prophylactic vaccine and induce conditionally active immune response that would eliminate nascent tumors only when drug treatment is used.

project	4UH3CA244697-03	UH3CA244697	10465296	2021	Intercepting progression from pre-invasive to invasive lung adenocarcinoma	Grant	Abstract Despite advances in therapeutic strategies, non-small cell lung cancer remains a deadly disease. An improved understanding of the biology of lung cancer is needed to intercept the disease at an early point in its progression. Our project, which is inspired by that challenge, focuses on events transpiring in the earliest radiographically-detected manifestation of lung cancer: the computerized tomography (CT)-detected non- solid nodule, of which as many as 40% harbor frankly invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, despite conventional wisdom that CT-detected non-solid nodules represent pre or minimally invasive malignancy, clearly transition to more invasive histologies occurs in a significant proportion of these nodules. Understanding the cellular and molecular changes within non-solid nodules that drive progression will provide unique and novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that alterations in cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a role in initiating and supporting this progression. In agreement with that proposal, our preliminary multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) studies suggest that progression to a more invasive phenotype is associated with the development of a strong immunosuppressive TME. In this project we test our hypothesis using multidimensional methods to profile the TME and to determine the crosstalk between cancer cells and the TME in pre-invasive to invasive human lung non-solid adenocarcinomas. Comparative analysis of the cellular and molecular events associated with the distinct histological stages will lead to identification of the critical events triggering progression and thereby identify targets to intercept disease progression. We will use appropriate mouse models in pre-clinical studies to develop these targets as strategies to intercept progression of pre-invasive to invasive cancer. In the first phase of these studies (UG3 phase), we will define TME alterations associated with progression of lung nodules using RNAseq profiling and image-based methods (multiplex IF and imaging CyTOF) in studies of our archival tumor samples. These studies will generate a comprehensive catalogue of the cellular and molecular events that trigger progression of indolent lesions to frankly invasive cancers, with a strong focus on immune mechanisms. These analyses will provide novel and detailed insights into how the composition and activity of the TME changes with progression. In the second phase (UH3 phase), we will leverage mouse models to explore interception strategies to target immune mechanisms and prevent progression. The proposed cohort satisfies the RFA’s focus on High-Risk Cohorts for Cancer-Immunoprevention Studies, since lung nodules are premalignancies highly prevalent in smokers.

This program project will have three highly collaborative and interactive projects headed by Drs. Mark Anderson (Project 1), Jeff Bluestone (Project 2) and John Kappler (Project 3) along with two scientific cores (Animal core and Molecular core). The major themes of the grant are: 1. The impact of central thymic tolerance on the T effector and Treg repertoire in T1D.. 2. Insulin as a critical self-antigen specificity for both T effectors and T regulatory cells in T1D. 3. Peptide specificity of Tregulatory cells in T1D 4. Using peptide binding characteristics of islet antigens to improve bioassays and tolerance methods. The long term objectives of this work is to improve our understanding of how T cell tolerance is controlled and the further refining the specificity of the autoreactive T cell response in type 1 diabetes. The investigators will be using state of the art tools in both animal models and in human subjects with type 1 diabetes. Results of these studies will help further refine our understanding of autoimmunity and help improve methods for its treatment and diagnosis.

The goal of our Program is to advance the pre-clinical science of NSCLC therapeutics. During the current funding period, our Program has advanced inhibitors of EGFR, promoting the pre-clinical development of osimertinib and related molecules, of TBK1, and of DDR2. In its next 5 years, our Program aims to develop compounds that will lead to more effective treatments for NSCLC and prevent or overcome resistance to existing and future targeted therapies.  To accomplish these goals, the Program seeks to achieve the following overall aims via 3 inter-related and collaborative Projects and 4 intellectually driven Shared Resource Cores. --Overall Aim 1. Develop inhibitors and/or degraders focused on mutant EGFR, KRAS signaling effectors, and mechanisms of transcriptional adaptation in non-small cell lung cancer. --Overall Aim 2. Characterize these compounds and their targets pharmacologically using genetically defined cellular and animal models of lung cancer. --Overall Aim 3. Develop and assess combinations of these potent and selective novel agents with existing therapies to prevent and overcome therapeutic resistance.  These aims leverage innovations in chemistry and structural biology—the development of allosteric kinase inhibitors and selective degraders—coupled with expertise in lung cancer biology, lung cancer cellular and animal modeling, and functional genomic approaches to understanding pathways, through the Projects and Cores. The broad aims will be implemented with three focused projects aimed at developing inhibitors of key pathways in NSCLC as well as over-arching mechanisms of resistance: --Project 1: Development of pharmacologic strategies to degrade mutant EGFR. --Project 2: Identification of combination therapy for KRAS-driven lung cancers. --Project 3: Targeting transcriptional mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.  Each Project and the overall Program is based on the innovative, technology-driven Cores, each led by faculty with expertise in the specific areas. Core A: Medicinal Chemistry. Core B: Structure and Biochemistry. Core C: Animal Modeling and Preclinical Therapeutics. Core D: Program Administration.  The integration of the three Projects and the four Cores will enable an effective co-ordination to meet Program aims by cross-fertilization of lung cancer focus and technological expertise.

During the prior 4 years of funding period, we have 1. defined the role of transplant in the era of novel agents; 2 Established the role of molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) in myeloma. 3. Established the role of both MRI and PET/CT in diagnosis and follow up of MM patients. 4. Identified and Validated number of novel targets. and 5. Defined patterns of clonal evolution and mutational signatures being utilized in MM. Our program has also developed novel targeted sequencing platform, developed a pipeline to identify mutations using RNA-seq, and developed a publicly available data analysis portal (Canevolve.org). Building on these advances, The overall specific objectives of the program are 1) To determine whether maintenance can be tailored based upon MRD status and whether achieving MRD negative status provides superior outcome In a 1260 patient randomized clinical study and to develop novel risk model (Project 1). Clinically annotated patient samples from this clinical trial will be utilized to study genomic and epigenomic correlates; 2) To identify the spectrum of epigenomic lesions and enhancer dependencies that underlie pathogenesis, progression, and clinical outcome in MM. (Project 2). New clinically-relevant epigenomic-centered targets identified will be validated further; 3) To identify and validate the molecular circuits/loops responsible for continued MM cell growth and develop strategies to interrupt these loops as a novel therapeutic approach. (Project 3). New targeted therapeutic agents will be translated to clinical trials to improve patient outcome; and 4) To define the impact of therapy on clonal evolution and identify mediators of genomic instability underlying disease prognosis and progression in MM (Project 4). New clinically relevant processes identified will be used to understand process of progression. These 4 projects will be supported by Administrative and Communication Core (1), Clinical and Tissue Core (2); Genomics Core (3); Genomic Sequencing Core (4) and Biostatistical and Bioinformatics Cores (5). This unique collaborative effort will improve our understanding of myeloma biology and define a new treatment paradigm for this presently incurable disease.

project	5P01CA155258-09	P01CA155258	9987267	2020	Integrative Oncogenomics of Multiple Myeloma	Grant	Project Summary (Overall) This renewal application stems from our successful first four years of a new program project grant funded in 2011, which brings together a talented group of investigators with expertise in basic biology (DFCI and Whitehead Institute at MIT), clinical science (IFM), as well as genomic and cell signaling (Sanger Institute UK and DFCI). During the prior 4 years of funding period, we have 1. defined the role of transplant in the era of novel agents; 2 Established the role of molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) in myeloma. 3. Established the role of both MRI and PET/CT in diagnosis and follow up of MM patients. 4. Identified and Validated number of novel targets. and 5. Defined patterns of clonal evolution and mutational signatures being utilized in MM. Our program has also developed novel targeted sequencing platform, developed a pipeline to identify mutations using RNA-seq, and developed a publicly available data analysis portal (Canevolve.org). Building on these advances, The overall specific objectives of the program are 1) To determine whether maintenance can be tailored based upon MRD status and whether achieving MRD negative status provides superior outcome In a 1260 patient randomized clinical study and to develop novel risk model (Project 1). Clinically annotated patient samples from this clinical trial will be utilized to study genomic and epigenomic correlates; 2) To identify the spectrum of epigenomic lesions and enhancer dependencies that underlie pathogenesis, progression, and clinical outcome in MM. (Project 2). New clinically-relevant epigenomic-centered targets identified will be validated further; 3) To identify and validate the molecular circuits/loops responsible for continued MM cell growth and develop strategies to interrupt these loops as a novel therapeutic approach. (Project 3). New targeted therapeutic agents will be translated to clinical trials to improve patient outcome; and 4) To define the impact of therapy on clonal evolution and identify mediators of genomic instability underlying disease prognosis and progression in MM (Project 4).

project	5P01CA210944-02	P01CA210944	9531295	2018	Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy	Grant	The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology and to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation therapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory effects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across multiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and animal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of projects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT (HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and durvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast carcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the mechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining dendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of resistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in Projects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a state-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to drive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.

The CAR developed at our center is now in international trials for refractory/relapsed pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remain as the major unmet medical need in blood cancers. Our central hypothesis is that therapies with combination of CAR T cells and universal CAR T cells created with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic editing will enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer. We have brought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and published together for many years. Each disease-focused project will be led by a recognized authority in the field. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which will coordinately closely with essential shared resource cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD22 will be used to address the remaining unmet medical need in ALL, which is the emergence of CD19 escape variants; and (ii) universal CAR T cells targeting CD19 will be tested in patients with CLL to determine the role of T cell intrinsic resistance to therapy. In AML, the central problem in CAR T cell therapy is the lack of a known surface antigen that is present on AML but lacking from normal hematopoiesis. The goal of Project 2 is to open a wide therapeutic window by genetically modifying normal marrow to make it resistant to killing by anti-AML CAR T cells, and delivering potent anti- leukemic CAR T cells specific for CD33. In Project 3, the overall hypothesis is that anti-myeloma efficacy will be maximized by (i) combining CART-BCMA and CTL019 to eliminate both the dominant neoplastic PC population and rare myeloma-propagating B cells, and (ii) modifying CAR T cells to circumvent specific myeloma-induced T-cell-inhibitory mechanisms (i.e., immune checkpoints). The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of project management for collaboration and biostatistics, clinical safety and monitoring, and fiscal support (Core A), a GMP facility for manufacture of cells and RNA (Core B), and a state-of-the-art platform for GLP analysis to provide high dimensional data of the samples generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the lessons of CAR T for ALL into meaningful efficacy against all hematologic malignancies.

project	5P01CA214278-04	P01CA214278	9982239	2020	Enhancing Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapies for Hematologic Malignancies: Beyond CART 19	Grant	OVERALL SUMMARY The long-term goal of this P01 is to develop next generation immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and to translate this research into new therapies with curative potential for patients with blood cancer. The CAR developed at our center is now in international trials for refractory/relapsed pre-B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remain as the major unmet medical need in blood cancers. Our central hypothesis is that therapies with combination of CAR T cells and universal CAR T cells created with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic editing will enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer. We have brought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and published together for many years. Each disease-focused project will be led by a recognized authority in the field. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which will coordinately closely with essential shared resource cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD22 will be used to address the remaining unmet medical need in ALL, which is the emergence of CD19 escape variants; and (ii) universal CAR T cells targeting CD19 will be tested in patients with CLL to determine the role of T cell intrinsic resistance to therapy. In AML, the central problem in CAR T cell therapy is the lack of a known surface antigen that is present on AML but lacking from normal hematopoiesis. The goal of Project 2 is to open a wide therapeutic window by genetically modifying normal marrow to make it resistant to killing by anti-AML CAR T cells, and delivering potent anti- leukemic CAR T cells specific for CD33. In Project 3, the overall hypothesis is that anti-myeloma efficacy will be maximized by (i) combining CART-BCMA and CTL019 to eliminate both the dominant neoplastic PC population and rare myeloma-propagating B cells, and (ii) modifying CAR T cells to circumvent specific myeloma-induced T-cell-inhibitory mechanisms (i.e., immune checkpoints). The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of project management for collaboration and biostatistics, clinical safety and monitoring, and fiscal support (Core A), a GMP facility for manufacture of cells and RNA (Core B), and a state-of-the-art platform for GLP analysis to provide high dimensional data of the samples generated in all Projects (Core C).

Encompassed within this broad overall goal are the following more specific goals: 1) develop novel therapeutic strategies for advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer and aggressive subtypes; 2) promote novel strategies for unmet clinical needs in prevention and conservative therapy of high-risk precancerous lesions and low grade endometrial cancer; 3) incorporate molecular diagnostics into clinical decision-making; and 4) recruit and support new investigators in endometrial cancer research through the Career Enhancement and Developmental Research Programs. Over the last 5 years, our SPORE has led the field with a highly productive translational research team that has helped to define the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of endometrial cancer. This proposal includes 4 translational research projects addressing scientific problems that span the breadth of endometrial cancer heterogeneity in an effort to impact as many patients as possible. Project 1, “Novel Targeted Strategies for Prevention and Conservative Management of Complex Atypical Hyperplasia and Grade 1 Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer,” includes a phase II trial using the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to improve standard conservative therapy (progestin-eluting intrauterine device) and is paired with innovative molecular profiling and pharmacologic approaches to further advance conservative treatment options. Project 2, “CTNNB1 Mutation and Wnt Pathway Activation Define Clinically Aggressive Endometrioid Endometrial Carcinoma,” focuses on targeted therapeutics and molecular mechanisms underlying a clinically aggressive subtype of endometrioid endometrial cancer that is driven through beta-catenin mutation and downstream Wnt pathway activation. Project 3, “EphA2 Targeting in Uterine Carcinoma,” focuses on the therapeutic target, EphA2. EphA2 is overexpressed especially in higher grade endometrioid carcinomas and in serous carcinoma and is associated with poor overall survival. A phase I clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a novel therapeutic (EPHARNA) that targets EphA2 by delivering short interfering RNA into tumor cells via a neutral liposome nanovehicle. This therapeutic was developed by Project 3 investigators. Project 4, “A Framework for Identification of Novel Targeted Therapy Combinations in Endometrial Cancer,” will evaluate tumor molecular changes from samples procured during a combinatorial trial of PARP and PI3K pathway targeted therapy to identify biomarkers of benefit for patients with endometrial cancer. This is paired with implementing a platform to evaluate mechanisms responsible for adaptive resistance to targeted therapies in order to enable a rational design of improved combination therapies. Four Cores will support these projects- Administrative Core, Pathology Core, Biomarkers Core, and Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) targeted in this proposal are rare tumors that face all of these challenges. NETs arise from the diffuse neuroendocrine system, occur in both adults and children, and are increasing in both incidence and prevalence in the United States. The University of Iowa is one of only a handful of academic or private institutions in the US where patients with NETs are diagnosed, treated, and regularly followed in a comprehensive manner. A multi-disciplinary NET clinic, an IRB approved registry and database, and a growing translational research program are housed at the University of Iowa. We have collaborated with pharmaceutical and biotech companies, patient support groups, and other research institutions whose expertise complements our clinical and translational expertise, to build a neuroendocrine tumor Center of Excellence. Iowa is poised to house the first SPORE in neuroendocrine tumors where academic, industry, and philanthropic organizations will partner with NCI to increase the length and quality of life for these unique patients. Our Overall Specific Aims are: 1. Support innovative translational research in Neuroendocrine Tumors. 2. Provide support to translational investigators through interactive cores. 3. Enlist and encourage new translational researchers in neuroendocrine tumors through developmental projects and career development. 4. Promote early and accurate diagnosis through outreach to physicians and advocacy groups.	90Y;Adult;Advocacy;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;Biometry;Biotechnology;Bone Marrow;Cancer Patient;Child;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collaborations;Communication;Complement;Data Analyses;Data Quality;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Imaging;Diagnostic Procedure;Diffuse;Disease;Dose;Early Diagnosis;Effectiveness;Evidence based treatment;Face;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genomic approach;Human;Image;Incidence;Industry;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Insurance;Investments;Iowa;Islet Cell Tumor;Kidney;Length;Malignant Neoplasms;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mutate;Neuroendocrine Therapy;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Neurosecretory Systems;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Physicians;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prevalence;Privatization;Prognostic Marker;Quality Control;Quality of life;Radiation;Radioisotopes;Radiopharmaceuticals;Recommendation;Registries;Research;Research Support;Resistance;Small Intestines;Source;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Structure;Support Groups;Toxic effect;Tracer;Translating;Translational Research;Tumor Bank;Tumor Tissue;United States;Universities;accurate diagnosis;career development;chemotherapeutic agent;exome;imaging agent;improved;innovation;metaiodobenzylguanidine;molecular marker;multidisciplinary;new therapeutic target;novel diagnostics;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;outreach;patient population;public health relevance;theranostics;therapeutic target;translational research program;translational scientist;tumor	UNIVERSITY OF IOWA	IOWA CITY	IA	UNITED STATES	M.

project	5P50CA174521-05	P50CA174521	9756316	2019	Neuroendocrine Tumor Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Human Cancer	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare tumors present several challenges, including lack of evidence based treatment recommendations, unwillingness of insurance companies to support unproven therapies, and keen competition for translational research support that may benefit only a small proportion of all cancer patients. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) targeted in this proposal are rare tumors that face all of these challenges. NETs arise from the diffuse neuroendocrine system, occur in both adults and children, and are increasing in both incidence and prevalence in the United States. The University of Iowa is one of only a handful of academic or private institutions in the US where patients with NETs are diagnosed, treated, and regularly followed in a comprehensive manner. A multi-disciplinary NET clinic, an IRB approved registry and database, and a growing translational research program are housed at the University of Iowa. We have collaborated with pharmaceutical and biotech companies, patient support groups, and other research institutions whose expertise complements our clinical and translational expertise, to build a neuroendocrine tumor Center of Excellence. Iowa is poised to house the first SPORE in neuroendocrine tumors where academic, industry, and philanthropic organizations will partner with NCI to increase the length and quality of life for these unique patients. Our Overall Specific Aims are: 1. Support innovative translational research in Neuroendocrine Tumors. 2. Provide support to translational investigators through interactive cores. 3. Enlist and encourage new translational researchers in neuroendocrine tumors through developmental projects and career development. 4. Promote early and accurate diagnosis through outreach to physicians and advocacy groups.	90Y;Adult;Advocacy;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;Biometry;Biotechnology;Bone Marrow;Cancer Patient;Child;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collaborations;Communication;Complement;Data Analyses;Data Quality;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Imaging;Diagnostic Procedure;Diffuse;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Effectiveness;Evidence based treatment;Expression Profiling;Face;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genomic approach;Human;Image;Incidence;Industry;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Institutional Review Boards;Insurance;Investments;Iowa;Islet Cell Tumor;Kidney;Length;Malignant Neoplasms;Molecular;Mutate;Neuroendocrine Therapy;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Neurosecretory Systems;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Physicians;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prevalence;Privatization;Prognostic Marker;Quality Control;Quality of life;Radiation Dose Unit;Radioisotopes;Radiopharmaceuticals;Recommendation;Registries;Research;Research Support;Resistance;Small Intestines;Source;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Structure;Support Groups;Toxic effect;Tracer;Translating;Translational Research;Tumor Bank;Tumor Tissue;United States;Universities;accurate diagnosis;career development;chemotherapeutic agent;exome;imaging agent;improved;innovation;metaiodobenzylguanidine;molecular marker;multidisciplinary;new therapeutic target;novel diagnostics;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;outreach;patient population;public health relevance;rare cancer;theranostics;therapeutic target;translational research program;translational scientist;tumor	UNIVERSITY OF IOWA	IOWA CITY	IA	UNITED STATES	DAWN E QUELLE	DCTD	Steven F Nothwehr	2139000	>=$1M	2139000	26-Aug-2019	1-Sep-2015	31-Aug-2022	PAR-14-031	Moonshot

The UIVI Prostate SPORE supports an interactive group of basic and clinical investigators in a translational research program that has led to major discoveries in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. Successful translation of discoveries in the most recent grant period include: 1) development of a urine test for prostate cancer which is now offered in CLIA reference laboratories (Sci TransI Med. 2011); 2) ETS gene fusion driven PCa that are susceptible to PARP inhibitor therapy (Cancer Cell 2011) which initiated a randomized Phase II trial (NCTOI576172); 3) germline mutations in HOXB 13 gene that conferred increased risk for PCa (N Engl J Med. 2012). This is being developed as a test for assessing PCa risk; 4) the first study describing the mutational landscape of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (Nature 2012,) and; 5) Cabozantinib was shown to have efficacy and decrease bone pain in prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis (J Clin Oncol. 2013). These bench-to-bedside applications were aided by horizontal collaborations with the Dana Farber, Baylor, Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins Prostate SPOREs as well as the EDRN and vertical collaborations with SWOG and biotech companies. This application consists of four multidisciplinary projects: Project 1: A Precision Medicine Approach to Elucidate Mechanisms of Progression and Resistance to Therapy in Advanced PCa; Project 2: Mechanisms of Sensitivity and Resistance to Cabozantinib in CRPC; Project 3: Development of Novel BET Bromodomain Inhibitors for the Treatment of Advanced PCa; Project 4: Development of IncRNAs as PCa Biomarkers in Urine. These projects are complemented by ongoing, successful Career Development and Developmental Research Programs. The projects and programs are supported by a strong ongoing institutional commitment of money and space as well as three cores: Administration, Biostatistics, and Tissue/Informatics. The UM Prostate SPORE program continues to place premiums on rigorous scientific review of its translational research programs, pairing of basic and clinical investigators, drawing on expertise of scientists from within and fro outside the prostate cancer field, and utilizing flexibility to fund promising new research approaches. The interaction of our multidisciplinary group of investigators clearly makes the Prostate SPORE program at the UMCCC is greater than the sum of its individual parts.

In this renewal application, U-M joins forces with Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) to propose a “Michigan Prostate SPORE” leveraging our institutions' respective areas of strength. KCI has a non-overlapping patient population as U-M, which includes an underserved population. The Michigan Prostate SPORE supports an interactive group of basic and clinical investigators in a translational research program that has led to major discoveries in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of PCa. Successful translation of discoveries in the most recent grant period include: 1) The ETS gene fusions (which were discovered by this SPORE program) have been established as a urine test for the early detection of PCa (JAMA Oncology 2017 3:1085) and have been therapeutically targeted with peptidomimetic inhibitors (Cancer Cell 2017 31:844). 2) Our SPORE program played a significant role in defining the clinically actionable landscape of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (Cell 2015, 162:454) which led to the discovery that upwards of 20-25% of mCRPC harbor defects in DNA repair genes. As part of the TO-PARP study, we showed that mCRPC patients with DNA repair defects preferentially respond to PARP inhibitors (NEJM 2015, 373:1697). 3) Established that BET bromodomain inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of advanced PCa by blocking oncogenic transcription factor activity (Nature 2014, 510:278). 4) Several PCa-associated long non-coding RNAs, including PCAT1, Schlap1 (Nature Genetics 2013 45:1392), and ARlnc1 (Nature Genetics 2018, 50:814) were discovered and characterized. These bench-to-bedside applications were aided by horizontal collaborations with the University of Washington, Dana Farber, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and Weill-Cornell Prostate SPOREs as well as the EDRN and vertical collaborations with SWOG and biotech companies. This application consists of four projects: Project 1: Targeting mCRPC Patients with Biallelic Loss of CDK12; Project 2: Integrating a Novel MiPS-Based Next- Generation Sequencing Urine Assay for the Early Detection of Unfavorable Risk PCa; Project 3: Exploring Ablation of the Androgen Receptor as a Therapeutic Approach for mCRPC; Project 4: Targeting Autophagy in the Treatment of mCRPC. These projects are complemented by strong, ongoing institutional commitments of money and space, successful Career Development and Developmental Research Programs, and three cores: Administration, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics, and Biospecimen/Pathology.

This work is urgently needed because cancer screening and prevention disparities exist with regard to delivery of evidence-based interventions (EBIs). Effective strategies to improve implementation of EBIs in primary care community health centers (CHCs) that can eliminate these disparities are not known or poorly understood. Implementation science can contribute new knowledge that will transform CHCs' ability to serve the nation's most vulnerable populations. The BRIDGE-C2 Center will: 1) create a sustainable infrastructure for developing, conducting, and continuously evaluating implementation strategies that enhance primary care's ability to equitably deliver evidence-based cancer screening and prevention interventions to all people, emphasizing closing care gaps for vulnerable populations; 2) build capacity and training opportunities, and engage a multi-disciplinary team of implementation science and methods experts, to facilitate the development of innovative approaches relevant to our grand challenge; and 3) identify strategies to improve implementation of cancer screening and prevention EBIs in primary care, and conduct research / develop pragmatic methods to tailor, enhance, and support the adoption and sustainability of these strategies. We will build on the strong established partnerships between researchers at Oregon Health & Science (OHSU) primary care, the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, and the OCHIN Implementation Laboratory (a well-established national network of >500 CHCs that share an electronic health record through the OCHIN Practice-Based Research Network). The BRIDGE-C2 Center will conduct pilot studies that develop and test strategies to improve implementation of EBIs, rapidly scale up successful pilots to conduct large scale pragmatic trials, and widely disseminate effective innovations to primary care practices caring for underserved populations. Woven throughout these activities will be the Center's focus on mentoring and training early career implementation scientists and leveraging collaborations to increase implementation science capacity. The Center's Administrative Core will serve as the nucleus that bridges the Research Program and Implementation Laboratory, providing support for research activities, leadership, governance, investigator development, dissemination, evaluation, and a connection to the national ISCCC network. Our first two research pilots aim to improve cervical cancer screening and follow-up care and tobacco cessation. Our first two methods pilots will create novel capabilities to predict needed implementation support based on provider and practice characteristics. We will spread our discoveries and create mechanisms for widely disseminating our findings and innovations to scientific, professional, and community networks to increase implementation of cancer screening and prevention EBIs and decrease health disparities.

project	5P50CA244431-02	P50CA244431	10020381	2020	Washington University Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Component Background and vision. As an Advanced Center, the vision of the Washington University Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control (WU-ISCCC) is to conduct implementation research to help eliminate cancer disparities in rural and other disadvantaged communities. Goal. The overall goal of the WU-ISCCC is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for rapid-cycle implementation research to increase the reach, external validity, and sustainability of effective cancer control interventions. Our goal and Center activities capture three distinct features: (1) a focus on elimination of cancer disparities; (2) the need for rapid-cycle studies; and (3) the use of systems science approaches to enhance methods and outcomes in implementation science. Setting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration, catalyzes new ideas, and ensures support for research that finds solutions for complex implementation challenges in real-world settings with high cancer disparities (rural and urban counties in Missouri and Illinois). Substantial matching contributions from Washington University will allow us to strategically invest in new ideas. Aims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) advance the field of implementation science in cancer control by conducting innovative and impactful research; (2) expand an exceptional, diverse team of implementation science investigators and stakeholders; (3) organize and integrate Center components to facilitate transdisciplinary team science; (4) develop an Implementation Laboratory (known as the “Innovation Incubator”) to serve as a conduit for innovative, rapid-cycle, and impactful research; and (5) address cancer disparities by making it as easy as possible for disadvantaged populations to encounter, use, and benefit from evidence-based interventions. Innovations and impact. The WU-ISCCC will be innovative and provide a significant return on the scientific investment. First, our Center has distinctive features that include a combined focus on cancer disparities, the application of strategies to conduct rapid-cycle studies, and the use of systems science approaches. Second, we have assembled a diverse, world class team with strong linkages to multiple practice settings that will be critical parts of our Innovation Incubator. Third, we will engage investigators from different disciplines and invest in the development of early career scholars as cancer implementation scientists. Fourth, we will strategically and creatively disseminate products in ways that will benefit researchers, practitioners, and community members. Fifth, we have developed a focused strategy for collective integration of our projects, cores, and units to ensure that the WU-ISCCC impact is greater than the sum of its individual parts. In summary, the WU-ISCCC will be a national resource for furthering implementation science for eliminating cancer disparities.

project	5P50CA244432-02	P50CA244432	10022103	2020	Optimizing Implementation in Cancer Control: OPTICC	Grant	OVERALL SUMMARY The mission of the OPTICC (Optimizing Implementation in Cancer Control) Center is to improve cancer outcomes by supporting optimized implementation of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) in cancer control. Optimized implementation occurs when: (1) the strategies employed to implement EBIs address the key barriers to implementation that are active in the specific settings in which implementation occurs, and (2) those strategies reflect the best possible methods for addressing the barriers. Despite two decades of progress in implementation science (IS), practical tools and guidance to support optimized EBI implementation are lacking; as a result, strategies are often mismatched to barriers and are often not optimized for effectiveness, efficiency, or fit with local resources. The result is suboptimal implementation in the form of lost time, effort, and resources and, ultimately, poorer cancer outcomes. The OPTICC Center will advance IS and, in turn, improve EBI implementation in cancer control by developing, testing, and refining innovative methods for optimizing EBI implementation. The OPTICC Center is a strategic collaboration of the University of Washington (UW), Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI), and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three cores will support its work. The Administrative Core will promote multidisciplinary collaboration, research excellence, and methodological innovation. It will also lead Center outreach and dissemination efforts, evaluate Center impact, and coordinate Center activities. The Research Program Core will conduct innovative implementation studies, method and measurement studies, and small pilot studies that advance the Center’s “grand challenge” IS theme of optimizing EBI implementation. A three-stage approach to optimizing EBI implementation will be taken—identify and prioritize barriers, match strategies, and test strategies—with measurement development spanning all three stages. The Implementation Laboratory Core will establish and coordinate a network of diverse clinical and community sites to conduct “in vivo” IS studies, implement cancer control EBIs, and shape the Center’s research agenda. The Center’s initial studies will focus on optimizing implementation of screening EBIs for cervical, colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer. However, the methods for optimizing EBI implementation that the Center will develop, test, and refine can be applied broadly across the cancer care continuum, for a wide range of cancers, to answer a wide range of IS questions.

project	5P50CA244433-02	P50CA244433	10021626	2020	The Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity	Grant	Abstract - Overall After decades of research developing and testing interventions for cancer control, we have the evidence needed to prevent more than half of all cancers. The impact of these strategies on cancer outcomes is significant for both the general population and low income and under-represented groups that bear a disproportionate share of preventable cancer burden, but evidence-based interventions have not been uniformly used across population groups. Gaps in implementation of the evidence base can be seen for nearly all known cancer prevention and early detection strategies. As a result, we incur substantial avoidable cancer morbidity and mortality and tolerate preventable inequities. The Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity (ISCCCE) will create an ecosystem for robust implementation science (IS) related to cancer prevention and control in Massachusetts community health centers (CHCs) and their local communities. Our theme, improving community health by integrating health equity and implementation science for evidence-based cancer control, reflects our critical mass of expertise in cancer disparities, IS, and community-based cancer prevention and control research. Our “grand challenge” is to address the inequitable implementation and limited scale of evidence-based interventions by developing and testing implementation strategies aimed at narrowing health inequities and by advancing methods that carefully consider the low-resource, complex nature of CHCs where adaptation and cost-effective solutions are needed most. The implementation studies we conduct will address inequities within CHC clinical practice as well as prevention interventions that link to community resources and assets. Our I-Lab is comprised of 31 CHCs who are members of the Mass League of Community Health Centers and use a common EHR vendor- neutral population management system that has extensive reporting capability within and across CHCs, which will allow us to study implementation outcomes in different geographic settings across the state using common measures. Given that achieving equity in community health requires clinical, community, and policy-level interventions, our pilots will also examine how to expand the impact and sustainability of CHCs’ cancer prevention efforts through effective partnerships in community and policy settings. Our Network Unit connects us directly with other Moonshot IS initiatives and national community health leadership, and expands opportunities for collaboration and synergy, building IS capacity in our own institutions and across the nation.

These models and methods will be used to guide selection and implementation of evidence-based programs for cancer prevention and control (CPC). We will initially focus on lung cancer screening in rural primary care settings, first in Colorado and then nationally through collaboration with a well- established primary care network (i.e., National Research Network). Our overarching framework will be our enhanced RE-AIM/PRISM model, which is an extension of the broadly used Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework with the addition of contextual factors (e.g., Intervention characteristics, implementation and sustainability infrastructure). It will serve as the basis to develop and test innovative assessments of costs, benefits, and value from the perspective of different stakeholders to understand and guide implementation. We will meaningfully engage with and include the perspectives of patients, providers, and staff stakeholders in all our studies. Our pilot Implementation Study will adapt, implement, and evaluate strategies using stakeholder-engaged approaches to value to guide the implementation of shared decision-making and smoking cessation related to lung cancer screening. Our Methods Unit will refine and evaluate our pragmatic cost assessment methods to determine implementation/replication costs from the perspective(s) of patients, providers, and delivery staff and then develop and pilot test brief survey measures of preferences regarding the relative benefit of different RE-AIM outcomes. We will then assess relationships among RE-AIM outcomes preferences and selection of different CPC programs. Finally, our Outreach and Network Unit will engage in a) outreach activities targeted at junior and mid-career investigators and practitioners including online professional development (e.g., graduate certificate program, micro-certification) and tailored mentoring and technical assistance approaches; b) dissemination activities to support the packaging and communication of research findings; and c) collaboration activities to facilitate partnerships on CPC and implementation science using multiple channels and including development of shared pragmatic D&I measures and data.

project	5P50CA244690-02	P50CA244690	10225988	2021	Advancing the Quality of Cancer Care through Behavioral Economics and Implementation Science	Grant	The grand challenge addressed by the Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (Penn ISC3) is to apply insights from behavioral economics to accelerate the pace at which evidence-based practices for cancer care are deployed to improve outcomes for individuals with cancer. Penn offers a unique environment in which to conduct this paradigm-shifting work, given our expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, and innovative cancer care delivery. The complementary and multi-disciplinary expertise of the three MPIs (Bei- das, Bekelman, Schnoll), coupled with existing Penn resources, including the Penn Center for Cancer Care Innovation [PC3I], the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics [CHIBE], and the Penn Imple- mentation Science Center at the Leonard Davis Institute [PISCE@LDI], represent a unique opportunity to ad- vance the quality of cancer care. The Administrative Core, led by Drs. Beidas, Bekelman, and Schnoll, will ensure that the activities of Penn ISC3 are coordinated, synergistic, and congruent with timelines. The Implementation Laboratory, led by Drs. Bekelman and Shulman, represents a diverse ecosystem that includes five hospitals and linked clinical sites, with over 200 oncologists that serve over 15,000 unique new patients annually. Our Research Program, led by Drs. Beidas and Buttenheim, will oversee the development and testing of implementation strat- egies that target patients and clinicians within our Implementation Lab and are centered on the idea of ‘nudging’ for optimal implementation and effectiveness outcomes. The Research Program includes investigators with ex- pertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery research, healthcare innovation, measurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we propose three Signature Pilot Projects and two Methods Projects with a commitment to rapid learning that will allow Penn ISC3 to be optimally nimble. Signature Pilot Project 1 (Jenssen/Leone) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase referral to tobacco cessation programs among cancer patients. Signature Pilot Project 2 (Bekelman/Patel) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase higher-value bone modifying agents in patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Common methods and measures are linked to allow for pooling of data and to accomplish our objectives of testing multilevel implementation strategies and mechanisms across contexts. Our exploratory and high-reward Signature Pilot Project 3 (Bekelman/Rendle) will test a patient-directed imple- mentation strategy that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to promote oral chemotherapy ad- herence and symptom management. Two methods projects, in support of the Projects, will advance the science of implementation methods. Methods Project 1 will develop a toolkit for the application of rapid cycle approaches (Asch/Buttenheim); Methods Project 2 will use qualitative comparative analysis to characterize multilevel con- textual variation (Barg/Rendle).

The Administrative Core will manage the Center, ensure that iDAPT is engaged with “real world” clinical partners, patients, and families, is well-networked with the Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control consortium, and engage in a comprehensive evaluation of Center activities and milestones. The Research Program will include an Implementation Studies Unit with an initial 2-year pilot study using adaptable technology to enhance shared decision-making in survivorship care planning for survivors of breast cancer. The Research Program also includes a Methods Unit with an initial innovation pilot study to test the feasibility of natural language processing to measure communication patterns pre-implementation and to monitor implementation fidelity of programs designed to enhance within-team and clinical team-to-patient electronic communication. The Research Program is expected to complete 8 to 10 pilot studies. In order to foster research aligned with iDAPT’s theme, we will build and sustain iDAPT’s Implementation Laboratory which incorporates capacity building and infrastructure for testing the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and real time deployment of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The laboratory includes primary care and oncology clinics in our local “Hubs” in southern Appalachia (North Carolina) and the northeast (Massachusetts) and “Spokes” including over 900 community-based oncology clinics in the NCIs National Community Oncology Research Program and nationwide Veteran’s Administration clinics. iDAPTs leadership is a multi-disciplinary team of experts with extensive experience in cancer-focused implementation science, behavioral science, computer engineering and computer science, clinical informatics, formative qualitative methods, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The iDAPT Developing Center will be considered successful if we achieve the following outcomes: (1) a robust, collaborative Implementation Laboratory with partners who are knowledgeable and experienced with implementation science in cancer control; (2) completion of 8 to 10 pilot projects related to iDAPTs emerging theme; (3) pilot grantees and lab partners are prepared to lead investigator initiated studies as a result of capacity building and pilot grant experiences; (4) junior faculty and underrepresented persons are engaged in all Center activities; (5) The field of implementation science in cancer control is advanced aligned within iDAPT’s emerging theme; and (6) iDAPT is part of a new network of ISCCCs who collectively build the field of implementation science in cancer control.

project	5R00CA181500-04	R00CA181500	9193624	2017	The Role of Protein Tyrosine Phosphate PRL3 in Leukemia Development	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aggressive and unpredictable nature of relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) represents a major clinical challenge, in large part due to highly toxic and ineffective chemotherapies. Further advances in therapy will require a detailed understanding of the molecular underpinnings of T- ALL development and relapse. To this end, I have completed a highly innovative screen in zebrafish to identify genes associated with T-ALL progression and have found that the protein tyrosine phosphotase PRL-3 was commonly amplified in single T-ALL cells as they developed increased ability to form relapse over time. In transgenic animals, PRL-3 over-expression significantly enhanced primary T-ALL development and relapse formation. I have found that PRL-3 amplified in a subset of human T-ALL and is highly expressed by a majority of T-ALL patient samples. These cells are also sensitive to PRL-3 knock-down through the induction of apoptosis. These results imply that PRL-3 activity has an important role in T-ALL malignancy, and that PRL-3 and its substrates may represent novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of T-ALL. The objectives of this proposal are to 1) define the contribution of PRL-3 to T- ALL progression and relapse and 2) identify the mechanism by which PRL-3 drives T-ALL malignancy. This objective will be achieved through two specific aims. During the K99 phase of this award, I will complete Aim 1, where I will examine the effect of PRL-3 gain-of-function and loss-of-function in various stages of T-ALL development in zebrafish, including invasion from the thymus, intravasation, proliferation and relapse, and I will also test the effects of PRL-3 knock-down on human cells in a murine xenograft model. During this phase, I will learn techniques to directly image cancer progression in live animals and to develop orthotopic leukemia xenografts in mice. With this knowledge in hand, during the R00 phase I will complete Aim 2, where I will identify the target substrates of PRL-3 in T-ALL cells, and test the contribution of these genes and pathways to T-ALL malignancy using in vivo and in vitro epistasis experiments. In total, this work will lay the foundation for the development of small molecule PRL-3 and pathway inhibitors for potential therapeutic use in T-ALL. The mentored phase of this award will occur under the guidance of Dr. David Langenau, an expert in zebrafish models of cancer, and Dr. Thomas Look, an internationally recognized leader in the field of leukemia research. Their proven track record of mentorship, coupled with an intensive didactic component and the rigorous and nurturing academic environment offered by the research community of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School offer the best opportunity for my success as I transition to becoming an independent investigator.

ADAM10 was shown to be quite important in humoral immune function. Mice in which their B cells lack ADAM10 (ADAM10B-/-) had defective lymphoid architecture. We will examine whether multiple antigen injections can overcome the defects seen. Newly data indicates that B cell TNF production is responsible for the altered germinal center architecture seen in the ADAM10B-/- mice and that this is due to increased expression of the TNF sheddase ADAM17. The opposite effects for ADAM10 will also be examined, namely what happens when ADAM10 is overexpressed in B cells. Early overexpression in hematopoietic stem cells was shown to block B cell production in the current funding period. Incorporation of a floxxed stop site in fron of the ADAM10 will allow delay of the overexpression until B cells develop. In addition, the ADAM17B-/- mouse should also have elevated ADAM10 expression and enhanced Ig production. Of particular interest is IgE production and we hypothesize that elevated IgE production will correlate with elevated B cell ADAM10. With respect to ADAM10 targets important in B cell function, based on preliminary data, we will concentrate on two substrates, CD23 and fractalkine. Finally, we will examine whether B cell exosomes play a role in the immunostimulatory activity of IgE-antigen complexes. In the second aim, mice with elevated B cell ADAM10 will be examined for enhanced lung inflammation in mouse asthma models and the effect of ADAM10 inhibitors will be examined to determine if this mechanism is solely ADAM10 related. The effect of ADAM10 inhibitors on the lymphoid architecture of the bronchial associated lymphoid tissues will be determined. Using IgE reporter mice, we will specifically determine the effect of ADAM10 inhibitors and ADAM10B-/- mice for germinal center and IgE plasma cell levels. We anticipate that when ADAM10 levels are inhibited we can specifically inhibit the IgE response. Using a model we have developed for suppression of an ongoing asthma response, ADAM10 inhibitors will be examined for their capacity to block this response. Mice lacking ADAM10 in their epithelial cells will be studied to determine whether ADAM10 inhibitors are working primarily by their effect on immune cells. Preliminary evidence indicates that a subpopulation of active allergic patients have elevated B cell ADAM10 levels when compared to controls. We will examine if the B cells from these patients have enhanced IgE production, using in vitro B cell stimulation models. Overall, the project will continue studies ino new promising avenues for understanding and harnessing ADAM10 to control the immune response. In addition, these two aims test the hypothesis that the ratio of ADAM10 to ADAM17 is important especially with respect to the allergic phenotype.

project	5R01AI084880-07	R01AI084880	9221950	2017	In vivo behavior of monocytes in resting and inflammatory conditions	Grant	﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Macrophages (MØ) are among the immune system's most important defenders of the body by protecting against infection and injury but they also accelerate numerous diseases. Recent studies indicate that many tissue MØ are generated during embryonic development and maintain themselves in adults in the steady-state. In diseased tissues, however, many MØ originate from circulating monocytes (Mo). For example, we found that circulating Mo often inﬁltrate the ischemic myocardium, atherosclerotic plaques and growing tumors, where they differentiate into MØ and can promote disease. These circulating Mo can be released in large quantities from different reservoir locations, including th bone marrow and spleen, and various diseases enhance Mo production in these reservoirs by amplifying hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) locally. At present, an accurate understanding of disease-induced MØ responses is lacking and requires a more comprehensive analysis of the origins and dynamics of these cells at the organismal level. The research proposed in this application will deﬁne both the quantity and quality of tissue MØ based on thei origins. We propose that, in disease, distinct anatomical sites produce different types of MØ precursors and we will thus test the hypothesis that disease-associated tissue MØ responses can be tailored by manipulating these cells' topo-ontogenic sources. First, by taking the entire HSPC➝Mo➝MØ lineage into account we will identify the most important kinetic processes that deﬁne the quantity of disease-associated MØ (aim 1). Second, by considering the different origins of these MØ we will uncover maturational pathways that inﬂuence their quality in vivo (aim 2). Our ﬁndings have therapeutic potential because in both aims we will deﬁne how Ang II pathway manipulations control MØ. Ang II is a newly identiﬁed driver of HSPC/Mo/MØ-mediated inﬂammation that is active in a variety of diseases (cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction) and can be targeted with FDA-approved drugs. Our goal is to develop new advances that can be used to restrain unwanted inﬂammatory reactions or instead promote delivery of protective immunity to tissue. Our experiments will use the so-called KP tumor mouse model because we have generated data indicating that: i) MØ in KP tumors have a dominant phenotype and promote disease; ii) many of these MØ originate from HSPC and Mo that are produced in bone marrow and spleen; iii) HSPC➝Mo➝MØ lineage ampliﬁcation in KP mice resembles the one observed in other disease models including myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis; and iv) the hormone Angiotensin (Ang) II ampliﬁes disease-promoting MØ in KP mice. Also, we have assembled a team of experts in imaging, leukocyte trafﬁcking, data modeling and integrative biology to accomplish our goals.

Recent studies indicate that many tissue MØ are generated during embryonic development and maintain themselves in adults in the steady-state. In diseased tissues, however, many MØ originate from circulating monocytes (Mo). For example, we found that circulating Mo often inﬁltrate the ischemic myocardium, atherosclerotic plaques and growing tumors, where they differentiate into MØ and can promote disease. These circulating Mo can be released in large quantities from different reservoir locations, including th bone marrow and spleen, and various diseases enhance Mo production in these reservoirs by amplifying hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) locally. At present, an accurate understanding of disease-induced MØ responses is lacking and requires a more comprehensive analysis of the origins and dynamics of these cells at the organismal level. The research proposed in this application will deﬁne both the quantity and quality of tissue MØ based on thei origins. We propose that, in disease, distinct anatomical sites produce different types of MØ precursors and we will thus test the hypothesis that disease-associated tissue MØ responses can be tailored by manipulating these cells' topo-ontogenic sources.

This DC population migrates to lymph nodes to induce adaptive immune responses and is notably proficient in cross-presentation of exogenous antigen to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Because of their tissue residence and function, CD103+ DCs are perfectly situated to regulate immune responses to tumors. However, little is understood about their role in cancer. CD103+ DCs are homologous to human tissue CD141+ DCs and DCs generated in GM-CSF for cancer therapy, and provide a genetically tractable system to understand these important DC populations. Recently, our lab and others found CD103+ DCs have a unique developmental pathway dependent on the cytokine GM-CSF, the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT5 and the transcriptional regulator Id2. This signaling pathway correlates with enhanced DC-mediated tumor immunity. By contrast, we found that the tumor-associated cytokine IL-6 represses Id2 expression in DCs via STAT3 signaling, rendering reduced DC-mediated tumor immunity. The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which STAT5 and STAT3 control CD103+ DC functional responses remain unclear. These gaps in knowledge are important to address to provide better use of DCs in immunotherapy. Based on our data, we hypothesize that GM-CSF-STAT5 and IL-6-STAT3 signaling have opposite roles in regulating DC anti-tumor activity via their control of Id2 expression in DCs. We will test this hypothesis wit 3 project aims. In Aim 1, we will delineate mechanisms by which tissue- resident DCs stimulate anti-tumor immunity by investigating the roles for STAT5 and its target gene Id2 in CD103+ DCs. We will study whether and how STAT5 and Id2 control CD103+ DC maturation, antigen presentation, T lymphocyte stimulation, pre-DC accrual in nonlymphoid tissue, and DC-mediated anti-tumor activity. In Aim 2, we will elucidate DC-intrinsic signaling mechanisms that regulate DC function in melanoma tumors. We will investigate roles for STAT3 in DCs in Id2 downregulation, immune responses to melanoma and melanoma combination immunotherapy. In Aim 3, we will examine mechanisms by which STAT5 and STAT3 regulate Id2 expression in DC development. We will evaluate whether and how STAT5 and STAT3 control chromatin modifications, co-factor recruitment and RNA polymerase II association at the Id2 promoter in vivo. We anticipate this project to reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CD103+ DC anti-tumor activity is regulated, paving the way for rational investigation into pathways controlling related human DC populations. This information could ultimately provide new opportunities to manipulate DCs in cellular therapy, cancer and/or immune disease.

While multiple genetic loci affect susceptibility, in most cases each in isolation has only a small effect, suggesting that disease develops only when multiple risk-conferring alleles that function in concert are inherited by a single individual. We hypothesize that such a situation exists in autoreactive B cells where multiple SLE risk alleles encode molecules that appear to function in signaling pathways that function normally to limit/terminate antigen receptor signaling. In this application we propose to test this hypothesis, analyzing the functional interplay of this set of genes/protein and their risk conferring alleles. Future development and implementation of “precision” medical approaches for treatment of autoimmunity will require an understanding of the mechanisms by which genetic variations conspire to increase disease risk, and research proposed here represents a critical first step to enable these efforts. A number of autoimmunity risk alleles encode molecules previously proposed to function as intermediaries in signaling pathways involved in regulation of B cell activation. As such they may be important in keeping autoreactive B cells from becoming activated and contributing to autoimmunity. In this application we request support to define the functions and functional interactions of proteins encoded by six genes, variants of which confer increased risk of autoimmunity. Previous reports indicate that B cell-targeted deletion of genes encoding SHIP-1, PTEN, SHP-1 or LYN, expression of PTPN22 (PEP-R619W), or increased expression of CSK, promote the development of autoimmunity. However the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. We hypothesize that these proteins function as intermediaries in a bifurcating pathway in which final effectors are the inositol lipid phosphatases SHIP-1 and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. Further, we suggest that both terminal effectors are required for maintenance of antigen unresponsiveness of anergic B cells. The studies will employ reductionist genetic models in which risk allele mimetic changes in expression/function of the proteins can be induced acutely in anergic B cells, and subsequent cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and autoantibody production monitored. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that PTPN22, CSK and LYN act in linear pathways upstream of SHIP-1 and SHP-1, and that genetic variations that confer risk compromise anergy by undermining their regulatory function. Aim 2 will define the downstream consequences of acute introduction of risk allele mimetic conditions in terms of development of autoimmune disease, and will test candidate therapeutic kinase inhibitors. Aim 3 will translate findings, examining the role of SHIP-1 and SHP-1 phosphatases in maintenance anergy of human B cells. Proposed studies will provide important new insight regarding the in vivo lifestyle of autoreactive B cells whose anergy is compromised by autoimmunity risk alleles.

While multiple genetic loci affect susceptibility, in most cases each in isolation has only a small effect, suggesting that disease develops only when multiple risk-conferring alleles that function in concert are inherited by a single individual. We hypothesize that such a situation exists in autoreactive B cells where multiple SLE risk alleles encode molecules that appear to function in signaling pathways that function normally to limit/terminate antigen receptor signaling. In this application we propose to test this hypothesis, analyzing the functional interplay of this set of genes/protein and their risk conferring alleles. Future development and implementation of “precision” medical approaches for treatment of autoimmunity will require an understanding of the mechanisms by which genetic variations conspire to increase disease risk, and research proposed here represents a critical first step to enable these efforts. A number of autoimmunity risk alleles encode molecules previously proposed to function as intermediaries in signaling pathways involved in regulation of B cell activation. As such they may be important in keeping autoreactive B cells from becoming activated and contributing to autoimmunity. In this application we request support to define the functions and functional interactions of proteins encoded by six genes, variants of which confer increased risk of autoimmunity. Previous reports indicate that B cell-targeted deletion of genes encoding SHIP-1, PTEN, SHP-1 or LYN, expression of PTPN22 (PEP-R619W), or increased expression of CSK, promote the development of autoimmunity. However the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. We hypothesize that these proteins function as intermediaries in a bifurcating pathway in which final effectors are the inositol lipid phosphatases SHIP-1 and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. Further, we suggest that both terminal effectors are required for maintenance of antigen unresponsiveness of anergic B cells. The studies will employ reductionist genetic models in which risk allele mimetic changes in expression/function of the proteins can be induced acutely in anergic B cells, and subsequent cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and autoantibody production monitored. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that PTPN22, CSK and LYN act in linear pathways upstream of SHIP-1 and SHP-1, and that genetic variations that confer risk compromise anergy by undermining their regulatory function. Aim 2 will define the downstream consequences of acute introduction of risk allele mimetic conditions in terms of development of autoimmune disease, and will test candidate therapeutic kinase inhibitors. Aim 3 will translate findings, examining the role of SHIP-1 and SHP-1 phosphatases in maintenance anergy of human B cells. Proposed studies will provide important new insight regarding the in vivo lifestyle of autoreactive B cells whose anergy is compromised by autoimmunity risk alleles.

project	5R01AR050026-13	R01AR050026	9487148	2018	Inflammation and Cardiovascular Disease in Rheumatoid Arthritis	Grant	ABSTRACT Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at 50% greater risk for developing heart failure (HF) and HF- associated morbidity and mortality than non-RA controls. This risk persists even after adjustment for coronary artery disease, implying that immunologic and inflammatory factors intrinsic to RA contribute to the increased risk of HF. Our overall hypothesis is that myocardial inflammation and microvascular ischemia are prevalent in RA patients, are mediated by antibodies to myocardial citrullinated proteins, promote impairment of left ventricular (LV) structure/function, and are attenuated with RA therapies. Indeed, in 128 RA patients without clinical CVD who underwent [18fluoro-deoxyglucose] positron emission-computed tomography (FDG PET-CT) (the RHYTHM study), we observed FDG uptake (inflammation) in 35% and impaired myocardial blood flow reserve (MFR) in 29%. Both myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR were strongly associated with clinical and laboratory measures of RA disease activity; impaired MFR was also associated with higher LV mass, a known precursor of HF. These data suggest that myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR mediate, in part, early changes in LV structure/function that predate clinical HF; but it is critical to confirm these relationships in longitudinal studies. Proximal events that mediate myocardial pathology in RA are unknown. We hypothesize that antibodies against citrullinated myocardial proteins (APCAs) mediate, in part, this abnormal myocardial phenotype (inflammation and impaired MFR), leading to myocardial remodeling and ultimately to functional decline. Our preliminary data demonstrating seroreactivity in 30% of RHYTHM sera in a novel myocardial protein array support this hypothesis. A related question is whether tumor necrosis inhibitors (TNFi’s) affect myocardial inflammation. This is a far from insignificant question as TNFi’s were associated with increased HF hospitalizations and death in non-RA HF patients and their risk for HF in RA is still unclear despite widespread use. In the next funding period, we seek to extend the study period for the RHYTHM cohort for aims 1 and 3, and to utilize an independently funded study (TARGET) for aim 2, in order to investigate the following aims: 1) To determine if imaging indicators of myocardial pathology at baseline (inflammation, impaired MFR) are predictive of longitudinal (adverse) change in measures of LV structure and function over 4-6 years in RA patients without clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. 2) To determine, in a currently enrolling NIH-NIAMS funded randomized clinical trial (the TARGET study), if RA therapies reduce myocardial inflammation. 3) To determine if seroreactivity to citrullinated myocardial antigens in RHYTHM participants is associated with baseline myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR and/or with change over time in parameters of LV structure/function. These investigations will advance understanding of mechanisms that contribute to and mitigate increased risk of myocardial dysfunction in RA.

The dendritic cell (DC) is a specialized immune sentinel that directs T cells to tolerance or immunity. DC comprise a rich network in skin consisting of several different populations, but are understudied, leaving a major gap in therapeutic intervention. We have identified distinct properties for DC in skin that relay information by migrating out to the draining lymph node (LN). We find during inflammation skin migratory DC may direct T cells to tolerance by unknown mechanisms, counter-regulating and controlling immunity. These cells are uniquely genetically programed in humans and in mouse to dampen immunity with a high expression of shared tolerance genes, including some genes such as PD-L1 that have been successfully targeted in the clinic for peripheral tissue cancers including melanoma skin cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer. We hypothesize homeostatic programming of skin DC leads to failed immune priming leading to impaired early detection of skin cancers. We find these pathways are of great importance as therapeutic targets to promote self-tolerance (such as during autoimmune disease) or to block tolerance (to improve immunity during cancer). Because these mechanisms are distinct they can be combined with current modalities for patients in immunotherapy of skin cancer, vaccine science, and inflammatory skin disease. In 2 discrete aims, this application will address programmatic conditioning of skin DCs and the unique cellular mechanisms by which they promote immune tolerance in both mice and humans, examining consequences during immune priming and early skin cancer growth.

In 2 discrete aims, this application will address programmatic conditioning of skin DCs and the unique cellular mechanisms by which they promote immune tolerance in both mice and humans, examining consequences during immune priming and early skin cancer growth.

The dendritic cell (DC) is a specialized immune sentinel that directs T cells to tolerance or immunity. DC comprise a rich network in skin consisting of several different populations, but are understudied, leaving a major gap in therapeutic intervention. We have identified distinct properties for DC in skin that relay information by migrating out to the draining lymph node (LN). We find during inflammation skin migratory DC may direct T cells to tolerance by unknown mechanisms, counter-regulating and controlling immunity. These cells are uniquely genetically programed in humans and in mouse to dampen immunity with a high expression of shared tolerance genes, including some genes such as PD-L1 that have been successfully targeted in the clinic for peripheral tissue cancers including melanoma skin cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer. We hypothesize homeostatic programming of skin DC leads to failed immune priming leading to impaired early detection of skin cancers.

Recent studies have reinvigorated the hypothesis that the outcome of radiation therapy is dependent upon the anti-tumor immune response and strongly support the testing of new combinations of ionizing radiation with immunotherapy. Heat shock protein (HSP) biology has been central to our research for many years. This work led to a completely new vaccine paradigm based upon the chaperone potential of large HSPs (first discovered by our group) and their ability to stimulate powerful anti-tumor immunity. Large HSPs, including hsp110 and the glucose regulated protein 170 (grp170) are related molecular chaperones that are highly efficient in binding to large substrate proteins. Our team has demonstrated that clinically relevant tumor antigens (e.g., gp100, HER- 2/neu, etc.) can be complexed to these large stress-response proteins by heat shock generating a highly effective antigen-specific, immune response. In a significant demonstration of lab bench-to-bedside research, our preclinical results led to a successful RAID application from the NCI for the development of a novel hsp110-based vaccine now undergoing Phase I evaluation in advanced melanoma patients. In new preliminary and published data, we have discovered that grp170 and pathogen-associated molecules (PAMPs) can act synergistically to stimulate the innate immune response and this is dependent on the chaperoning activity of grp170. We believe that this discovery can result in a novel, multipronged approach to cancer therapy. Therefore, we have engineered a chimeric chaperone, termed Flagrp170, by fusing a truncated grp170 chaperone with bacterial flagellin-derived PAMP which has an NF-kB-activating domain. Since preliminary data show a strong potential for Flagrp170 to provide a radioprotective effect, we hypothesize that this novel agent could both enhance therapeutic responsiveness to ionizing radiation (through enhanced immune responses of the vaccine) and provide critical protection of normal tissue. We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we predict that this chaperoning competent chimeric macromolecule can preferentially deliver selected antigens to specialized antigen-presenting cells and concurrently stimulate the NF-kB signaling for their functional activation. In Aim 2, we will test whether vaccination with Flagrp170 complexed with tumor antigen will generate a more potent and durable immune response than unmodified grp170. In Aim 3, the potential of using Flagrp170 to improve efficacy of ionizing radiation and provide tissue protection against radio-toxicity will be investigated. Successful completion of proposed research will not only provide a better understanding of the multifunctional features of the chimeric chaperone, but will also establish a scientific rationale for design the new generation of HSP-based vaccines to be used alone or in conjunction with the standard-of-care therapies (e.g., radiotherapy) in future clinical trials.

project	5R01CA121118-09	R01CA121118	9269156	2017	A High-Throughput Model for Human Melanoma	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The increasing incidence of melanoma and mortality associated with advanced stages of the disease are cause for concern. Recent reports on the efficacy of therapeutic agents targeting the most common alteration in melanoma, mutant BRAF, have been very encouraging and have shifted the treatment paradigm for this disease. Despite these impressive clinical successes, a significant percentage of patients are intrinsically resistant to BRAF inhibitors and those who initially respond ultimately relapse as a result of acquired resistance. In addition, nearly half of all melanomas contain wild-type BRAF and are therefore not sensitive to mutant BRAF inhibitors. While targeted therapies have the potential to revolutionize cancer care by providing personalized treatment strategies that are less toxic and more effective, maximizing their effectiveness requires increased knowledge of the molecular alterations that drive tumor formation, progression, maintenance, and resistance. In vivo models fulfill this need. We have developed a novel mouse model of melanoma that not only aids in the identification and validation of alterations that drive tumor growth but also provides a means to assess tumor progression and efficacy of therapeutic strategies. Importantly, melanomas can be induced in our model using the same genetic alterations observed in the human disease and specific gene combinations result in both lung and brain metastases, which are responsible for nearly half of all melanoma patient deaths. We have observed that despite their high sequence and functional similarity, AKT2 and AKT3 significantly differ in their ability to promote brain metastases in the context of mutant BRAF in vivo. Interestingly, brain metastases are also not observed in mice with mutant BRAF-driven tumors that lack Pten, which is believed to contribute to melanoma development and progression through deregulated AKT activity. We are uniquely poised to investigate the mechanistic differences between these tumors in vivo using our novel mouse model. We hypothesize that the differential ability of the three AKT isoforms and Pten loss to induce brain metastases is due to differential downstream signaling and that genetic suppression of AKT3 in this context will significantly delay the development and growth of distant metastases. To test this hypothesis, we will define the functional domain(s) that dictate AKT isoform specific melanoma brain metastases in vivo, use functional proteomics to identify AKT3-dependent effectors involved in promoting brain metastases, and utilize an in vivo genetic approach to evaluate the effect of targeting AKT3 on melanoma growth and metastasis. We will further validate our findings in melanoma tissue from patients. The long-term goals of this project are to identify targets that promote brain metastases as well as biomarkers that identify the subset of melanoma patients that are most likely to develop brain metastases and would therefore benefit from more aggressive therapy.

While targeted therapies have the potential to revolutionize cancer care by providing personalized treatment strategies that are less toxic and more effective, maximizing their effectiveness requires increased knowledge of the molecular alterations that drive tumor formation, progression, maintenance, and resistance. In vivo models fulfill this need. We have developed a novel mouse model of melanoma that not only aids in the identification and validation of alterations that drive tumor growth but also provides a means to assess tumor progression and efficacy of therapeutic strategies. Importantly, melanomas can be induced in our model using the same genetic alterations observed in the human disease and specific gene combinations result in both lung and brain metastases, which are responsible for nearly half of all melanoma patient deaths. We have observed that despite their high sequence and functional similarity, AKT2 and AKT3 significantly differ in their ability to promote brain metastases in the context of mutant BRAF in vivo. Interestingly, brain metastases are also not observed in mice with mutant BRAF-driven tumors that lack Pten, which is believed to contribute to melanoma development and progression through deregulated AKT activity. We are uniquely poised to investigate the mechanistic differences between these tumors in vivo using our novel mouse model. We hypothesize that the differential ability of the three AKT isoforms and Pten loss to induce brain metastases is due to differential downstream signaling and that genetic suppression of AKT3 in this context will significantly delay the development and growth of distant metastases. To test this hypothesis, we will define the functional domain(s) that dictate AKT isoform specific melanoma brain metastases in vivo, use functional proteomics to identify AKT3-dependent effectors involved in promoting brain metastases, and utilize an in vivo genetic approach to evaluate the effect of targeting AKT3 on melanoma growth and metastasis. We will further validate our findings in melanoma tissue from patients. The long-term goals of this project are to identify targets that promote brain metastases as well as biomarkers that identify the subset of melanoma patients that are most likely to develop brain metastases and would therefore benefit from more aggressive therapy.

project	5R01CA121118-12	R01CA121118	10307118	2022	A High-Throughput Model for Human Melanoma	Grant	Significant advances in melanoma research have resulted in new therapies that have remarkably improved the management and overall survival of melanoma. However, many patients still succumb to the disease and more than half of all melanoma deaths are due to brain metastases. As a means to overcome this challenge, we developed a novel mouse model that allows postnatal delivery of genes of interest to melanocytes. Using genomic and proteomic data from human melanoma samples, we tested several gene combinations for their ability to induce metastatic melanoma in vivo. Hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the context of mutant BRAF and CDKN2A loss resulted in the development of spontaneous melanoma with full penetrance and a mean survival of only 6 weeks. The majority of these mice also developed multiple metastases to the lungs and brain. This model mimics the human disease genetically, histologically, and by sites of metastasis. Importantly, this model system provides a powerful platform to further study the mechanisms of melanoma metastasis. Elucidation of this network will allow the identification of key pathway nodes that represent potential therapeutic targets to disrupt this process. We used next generation sequencing and proteomics analysis of non-metastatic and metastatic tumor samples to identify downstream targets of AKT1 implicated in melanoma brain metastasis. Our data showed that tumors expressing activated AKT1 displayed elevated levels of focal adhesion (FA) factors and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (P-FAK). In addition, mutant AKT1 expression increased invasion and this was reduced by pharmacological inhibition of either AKT or FAK. Moreover, loss of PTEN, which also results in increased FAK activity, cooperated with activated AKT1 to further enhance brain metastasis in vivo. Despite these promising preliminary findings, a critical gap still remains in understanding whether and how FAK promotes melanoma brain metastasis, and whether the AKT1-FAK-PTEN axis can be exploited as a therapeutic target in this disease. Our long-term goal is to use this knowledge to develop novel melanoma therapies and improve patient outcomes. Pursuant to this goal, we have generated a diverse collection of state-of-the-art research tools and assembled a talented team of scientists and clinicians with a track record of productive collaboration to carry out and critically evaluate the results of the proposed aims. Using these unique resources, we propose to test the following hypotheses: 1) AKT1→ FAK signaling is essential for the development of melanoma brain metastases; 2) Combined inhibition of BRAFV600E, MEK, and FAK is superior to standard of care targeted therapy and; 3) Loss of PTEN expression results in sustained FAK phosphorylation, which enhances the development of melanoma brain metastases. Successful completion of the aims in this proposal will significantly impact the field by laying the groundwork for translation into clinical trials, leading to new and better treatments for patients with brain metastases and those who are at high risk of developing brain metastases.

project	5R01CA124633-10	R01CA124633	9263888	2017	Pathogenesis and Treatment of NUT-Midline Carcinoma	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this project is a rare, highly aggressive, and incurable subtype of squamous cell carcinoma, genetically defined by rearrangement of the NUT gene, and termed midline carcinoma (NMC). The goals of the enclosed proposal are 1) to determine the pathogenesis and 2) effective therapy of NMC.  NMC is characterized by a simple karyotype harboring a single translocation involving the NUT gene with members of the bromodomain-containing BET family, most commonly BRD3 or BRD4. The resultant BRD- NUT fusion protein is causative in this cancer, acting to block differentiation and maintain NMC cells in a perpetually proliferative state. Several pieces of evidence have led us formulate a model whereby BRD-NUT blocks differentiation by sequestering chromatin "writers" necessary for transcription, such as histone acetyl- transferases (HATs), away from genes required for differentiation to limited genomic regions where the bromodomains of BRD "read" and activate transcription of pro-growth, anti-differentiative genes. Indeed, drug inhibitors of the acetyl-histone binding bromodomains (BETi) or of histone deacetylases unblock the BRD-NUT induced blockade on differentiation, resulting in differentiation and arrested proliferation of NMC cells in vitro and in vivo. Both approaches have been used therapeutically in patients.  In support of the above model, recent findings indicate that the transcriptional upregulation of the common cancer gene, MYC, by BRD4-NUT is required and can replace BRD4-NUT's function to block differentiation.  The first aim, to identify the molecular mechanisms by which BRD4-NUT leads to the MYC-dependent blockade of differentiation in NMC cells, will be accomplished by isolating and sequencing genes with which BRD4-NUT associates, and correlating with changes that occur in expression of those genes under conditions which promote differentiation in NMC cells. The gene targets of BRD4-NUT identified in these studies will be correlated with findings acquired from the genome-wide siRNA knockdown, which will identify specific genes whose expression is required for the blockade of differentiation in NMC cells. After a list of key target genes is identified and prioritized based on pathway analysis, they will be tested for their effects on MYC protein and RNA levels to identify which BRD4-NUT target genes are required to upregulate MYC levels. In addition, identification of BRD4-NUT-containing protein complexes by mass-spectrometry will be performed to identify proteins which collaborate with BRD4-NUT to upregulate MYC.  The second aim, an exploratory aim, to identify mutations in NMC cells that collaborate with BRD4-NUT in the blockade of differentiation and maintenance of growth of NMC cells, will be accomplished by sequencing all coding genes of approximately ten NMC tumors. The purpose of this aim is also to identify mutant proteins which aid BRD4-NUT oncogenic activity that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors in the treatment of NMC.

project	5R01CA124633-12	R01CA124633	9724379	2019	Pathogenesis and Treatment of NUT-Midline Carcinoma	Grant	Project Summary Abstract. NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), with a median survival of 6.7 months, is one of the most aggressive solid tumors known. It is a subtype of squamous cell carcinoma characterized by translocation of the NUT (aka NUTM1) gene, most commonly forming a fusion to the double-bromodomain encoding protein (BET), BRD4. There is an urgent need for the identification of more specific therapeutic targets in NMC. The over-reaching goal of this proposed project is to greater understand the mechanism of BRD4-NUT oncogenesis and identify effective therapeutic targets for treating this disease.  BRD4-NUT functions to block differentiation and maintain proliferation of NMC cells, largely through activation of MYC expression. This function is disrupted upon treatment with BET inhibitors, which as acetyl- lysine mimetics prevent binding of BRD4 bromodomains to acetylated chromatin. BRD4-NUT drives the expression of pro-growth target genes, including MYC, through the formation of megabase-sized massive hyperacetylated 'megadomains'. BRD4-NUT megadomains arise from pre-existing active enhancers and spread to fill cell-type-specific topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are higher order genomic structures whose function is to orchestrate cell-fate determining transcriptional programs through DNA-DNA contacts. Unique proteins recruited by BRD4-NUT recently identified by our group include the histone acetyl- transferase (HAT), p300, and several ZNF proteins collectively termed Z4. These findings indicate that BRD4- NUT ‘hijacks’ cell-type specific TADs to drive transcription of pro-growth, anti-differentiative genes as postulated in the following model: First, BRD4-NUT complex proteins seed regions corresponding to cell-type- specific active TADs through the chromatin-binding of BRD4. Second, megadomains form from contiguous expansion of BRD4-NUT complexes across chromatin in a feed-forward manner dependent upon p300 HAT activity. Third, megadomain size is limited by TAD boundaries and HDAC activity recruited by the Z4 complex. Fourth, hyperacetylated chromatin, recruitment of chromatin remodelers, and upregulation of cis lncRNAs changes the chromatin configuration to enhance DNA-DNA interactions to drive transcription of key pro- growth, anti-differentiative genes. The goals of this proposal are to test this hypothetical model, as listed in the specific aims below. Aim 1. To determine how BRD4-NUT megadomains form. Aim 2. To determine how BRD4-NUT megadomains function. Impact. Successful completion of the aims is expected to identify key BRD4-NUT-associated proteins in pathologic megadomain formation, and will identify novel and possibly more effective therapeutic targets in NMC and other cancers. In addition, we predict that BRD4-NUT megadomains will provide a model with far- reaching impact on the structure-function relationship of chromatin conformation in cancer and development.

Despite the grim clinical picture, cancer genetics has revealed that lung cancers can be divided into genetically-defined subsets based on driver oncogene mutations that, in turn, serve as predictive biomarkers for the clinical deployment of new first-line pathway-targeted therapies in lung cancer patients. However, to date, only a minority of such patients have benefitted from these advances such that treatment options for most patients remain poor and are limited to conventional approaches including surgery, radiation, and/or conventional chemotherapy that are ineffective against tumor cells and toxic to normal cells. The overarching, long-term goal of this research is to aid the deployment of rational, evidence-based therapeutic strategies to treat lung cancer patients. However, the immediate objectives of this proposal are to mechanistically define how parallel pathways, such as WNT→ß-catenin→c-MYC or PI3'-kinase→PDK→AKT signaling, cooperate with oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer. To do so we will use: State-of-the-art genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer; Lung cancer- derived cell lines whose aberrant behavior is driven by relevant genetic abnormalities; Pathway-targeted therapeutics, many of which are in cancer clinical trials and one of which is specifically being tested in lung cancer and; An innovative transposon mutagenesis system to simultaneously elicit lung cancer progression and identify its underlying genetic cause. Building on a solid foundation of studies published in the previous cycle of this grant, in Aim 1 we will identify the tumor cell autonomous mechanisms by which WNT→ß-catenin signaling cooperates with oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer. In Aim 2 we will explore the mechanisms by which PI3'-kinase signaling promotes the proliferative expansion and maintenance of both early- and late-stage BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors. BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors remain uniformly benign unless cooperating genomic events unleash malignant progression. In Aim 3 document the use of Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis to promote progression of BRAFV600E- driven lung cancers. Genetic progression factors identified will be validated using lentivirus-mediated cDNA expression or by in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tumor suppressor gene silencing in the mouse lung. Moreover, we will mine the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma genome, RNA sequencing and RPPA databases to credential genes implicated in our SB screen in mice as being directly relevant to bona fide human lung cancer. Finally, although this proposal is focused primarily on studies of genetic cooperation in the genesis of lung cancer, we will test the anti-tumor effects of novel pathway-targeted inhibitors of BRAFV600E, WNT or PI3'- kinase signaling that are likely to have important translational implications for the design and evaluation of new pathway-targeted strategies to treat patients with this ubiquitous, devastating and poorly understood disease.	1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase;Acyltransferase;Address;Alleles;Apoptosis;Behavior;Benign;Biochemistry;Biological Models;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Patient;Cell Cycle;Cell Line;Cellular biology;Cessation of life;Clinical;DNA Sequence Alteration;Databases;Dependency;Development;Disease;Disease Resistance;Dissociation;Drug resistance;Evaluation;Event;Experimental Models;Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinases;Foundations;Future;Gene Silencing;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Growth;Human;In Vitro;Investigation;Lesion;Ligands;Lipids;Lung;Lung Adenocarcinoma;Lung Neoplasms;MEKs;Maintenance;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Mediating;Minority;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Molecular Mechanisms of Action;Mus;Mutagenesis;Mutation;Normal Cell;Oncogene Activation;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;PDPK1 gene;PI3 gene;PTEN gene;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Phase;Physicians;Play;Porcupines;Prognostic Marker;Protein Array Analysis;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Publishing;Radiation;Research;Resources;Risk stratification;Role;Scientist;Scourge;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Sleeping Beauty;Solid;Specimen;Subfamily lentivirinae;System;Talents;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Therapeutic;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Ursidae Family;Validation;WNT Signaling Pathway;X-Ray Computed Tomography;antitumor effect;base;beta catenin;c-myc Genes;cDNA Expression;cancer clinical trial;cancer genetics;cancer initiation;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;design;evidence base;experimental study;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;lung carcinogenesis;lung tumorigenesis;mouse model;neoplastic cell;novel;predictive marker;public health relevance;response;senescence;statistics;targeted treatment;tool;transcriptome sequencing;translational cancer research;tumor;tumor progression	UNIVERSITY OF UTAH	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	UNITED STATES	MARTIN  MCMAHON	DCB	Joanna M.

project	5R01CA131261-10	R01CA131261	9757716	2019	Studying the initiation, progression and therapy of lung cancer in mouse models	Grant	﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is a global scourge responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide and ~160,000 deaths in the USA this year alone. Despite the grim clinical picture, cancer genetics has revealed that lung cancers can be divided into genetically-defined subsets based on driver oncogene mutations that, in turn, serve as predictive biomarkers for the clinical deployment of new first-line pathway-targeted therapies in lung cancer patients. However, to date, only a minority of such patients have benefitted from these advances such that treatment options for most patients remain poor and are limited to conventional approaches including surgery, radiation, and/or conventional chemotherapy that are ineffective against tumor cells and toxic to normal cells. The overarching, long-term goal of this research is to aid the deployment of rational, evidence-based therapeutic strategies to treat lung cancer patients. However, the immediate objectives of this proposal are to mechanistically define how parallel pathways, such as WNT→ß-catenin→c-MYC or PI3'-kinase→PDK→AKT signaling, cooperate with oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer. To do so we will use: State-of-the-art genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer; Lung cancer- derived cell lines whose aberrant behavior is driven by relevant genetic abnormalities; Pathway-targeted therapeutics, many of which are in cancer clinical trials and one of which is specifically being tested in lung cancer and; An innovative transposon mutagenesis system to simultaneously elicit lung cancer progression and identify its underlying genetic cause. Building on a solid foundation of studies published in the previous cycle of this grant, in Aim 1 we will identify the tumor cell autonomous mechanisms by which WNT→ß-catenin signaling cooperates with oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer. In Aim 2 we will explore the mechanisms by which PI3'-kinase signaling promotes the proliferative expansion and maintenance of both early- and late-stage BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors. BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors remain uniformly benign unless cooperating genomic events unleash malignant progression. In Aim 3 document the use of Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis to promote progression of BRAFV600E- driven lung cancers. Genetic progression factors identified will be validated using lentivirus-mediated cDNA expression or by in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tumor suppressor gene silencing in the mouse lung. Moreover, we will mine the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma genome, RNA sequencing and RPPA databases to credential genes implicated in our SB screen in mice as being directly relevant to bona fide human lung cancer.

project	5R01CA143971-07	R01CA143971	9223676	2017	Understanding the AGL metastasis suppressor for therapeutic gain	Grant	﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer kills 15,000 annually and because of few therapeutic advances there is a need for innovation. This project has discovered suppressors of bladder tumor growth and metastasis and shown that low expression of AGL, an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis, and RhoGDI2, an inhibitor of multiple GTPases, is associated with cancer recurrence and death. The Goal of this continuation project is to understand how reduced AGL levels result in aggressive bladder cancer and to translate this knowledge into novel therapies. We found bladder cancer cells with low AGL express elevated levels of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) synthase 2 (HAS2), and its extracellular product HA, and have activated RhoC and Rac1, known drivers of tumor progression. We demonstrated RhoC/Rac1 activity is suppressed by RhoGDI2, linking the actions of the two metastasis suppressors. Cells with low AGL also exhibit increased glycolysis, glucose import and autophagy. When either glucose import or autophagy are blocked, low AGL tumor cells show greater reduction of in vitro growth than cells with higher AGL levels, exposing a vulnerability of these aggressive cells. These data support an innovative Hypothesis: Tumor cells with low AGL generate growth and metastatic signals via production of HA, activation of its receptors CD44 and RHAMM, and downstream effectors such as RhoC and Rac1. For these signals to be actualized, sufficient energy needs to be provided via enhanced glucose import and autophagy. Three Specific Aims will test this hypothesis. 1) Evaluate impact of HA signaling on aggressiveness of bladder cancers with low AGL. We will determine if HA drives tumor progression via its receptors CD44 and RHAMM and effectors RhoC and Rac1 that are inhibited by RhoGDI2. Experiments will use RNAi and receptor inhibition in human xenografts. 2) Determine role of the AGL signaling network in bladder cancer development and progression. We will evaluate the independent predictive value of tumor suppressor genes and components of the AGL signaling network in a large panel of annotated human tumors, to define a predictive multigene biomarker signature and possible new therapeutic targets. We will use full and conditional (bladder urothelium) AGL knockout mice in a chemical carcinogenesis model that generates spontaneous visceral metastases to test whether lack of AGL makes urothelium more susceptible to carcinogenesis and resulting tumors more aggressive. 3) Target molecular vulnerabilities of bladder cancers with low AGL expression. Here we test whether blocking glucose import and/or autophagy reduces in vivo bladder tumor growth. We will use shRNA and pharmacologic agents already in preclinical/clinical testing. We will screen shRNA libraries to metabolic and autophagy genes in cells with low AGL to discover novel genes essential to the aggressive tumor phenotype, with the expectation that some of these will become therapeutic targets. We will evaluate combined inhibition of HA signaling and energy production pathways with the expectation this will have synergistic detrimental effects on tumor progression. Impact: This project will lay the foundation for future biomarker-driven personalized clinical trials that target critical vulnerabilities in bldder cancer while informing us on how AGL executes its unanticipated role in cancer.

We aim to understand mechanisms underlying oncogenic signaling and drug resistance in melanoma in order to improve the current treatment options. The serine/threonine kinase, BRAF, is somatically mutated in ~50% of melanomas and drives hyper-activation of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling, aberrant growth and invasion. While BRAF and MEK inhibitors are now first-line therapy for advanced-stage mutant V600E BRAF melanomas, they only delay mortality. Thus, we must understand how to build on BRAF+MEK inhibitor treatments and determine how to combine them with immune checkpoint agents, which remove the blocks on T cell action. In the previous cycle of this grant, we showed that up-regulation of FOXD3- ErbB3 signaling is an adaptive response to BRAF inhibitors that promotes a state of drug tolerance in mutant BRAF melanoma. Furthermore, we showed that inhibition of ErbB3 enhanced the effects of BRAF inhibitors in mutant BRAF melanomas in vivo. In this current proposal, we aim to identify mechanisms regulating FOXD3 in mutant BRAF melanomas, test the possibility that epigenetic BET/BRD inhibitors will block adaptive responses to BRAF+MEK inhibitors and alter the tumor microenvironment, and determine how FOXD3 expression alters the infiltration/activation status of tumor-associated immune cell populations and the expression of putative immune checkpoint proteins. At the completion of our experiments, we expect to have identified tumor and stromal markers for adaptive responses to targeted therapy and informed future combinatorial targeted inhibitor, epigenetic inhibitor and immune-based therapeutic strategies in mutant BRAF melanoma.	3-Dimensional;Antibodies;BRAF gene;Biological Markers;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cells;Cutaneous Melanoma;Down-Regulation;Drug Tolerance;Drug resistance;ERBB3 gene;Epigenetic Process;Fibroblasts;Future;Goals;Grant;Growth;Growth Factor Receptors;Health Care Costs;Heterogeneity;Immune;Immune Cell Activation;Immunocompetent;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Infiltration;Lead;MAPK3 gene;MEK inhibition;MEKs;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Melanoma Cell;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutate;NRG1 gene;Neural Crest;Neuregulins;Oncogenic;PD-1/PD-L1;PDCD1LG1 gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Population;Protein Dephosphorylation;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Proteins;Regimen;Regulation;Research;Resistance;Role;Schedule;Signal Transduction;Skin Cancer;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Threonine;Toxic effect;Translations;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Up-Regulation;actionable mutation;anti-PD-1;anti-PD-L1;base;cancer therapy;combinatorial;cost;effective therapy;experimental study;health care delivery;immune checkpoint;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;melanoma;mortality;mutant;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;response;side effect;single cell analysis;small molecule inhibitor;targeted treatment;transcription factor;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment	THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	Andrew E Aplin	DCTD	SUNDARESAN  VENKATACHALAM	359385	$250k to $499k	359385	1-Aug-2019	1-Jun-2012	31-Jul-2023	PA-16-160	Moonshot

At the completion of our experiments, we expect to have identified tumor and stromal markers for adaptive responses to targeted therapy and informed future combinatorial targeted inhibitor, epigenetic inhibitor and immune-based therapeutic strategies in mutant BRAF melanoma.	3-Dimensional;BRAF gene;Biological Markers;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cells;Cutaneous Melanoma;Down-Regulation;Drug Tolerance;Drug resistance;ERBB3 gene;Epigenetic Process;Fibroblasts;Future;Goals;Grant;Growth;Growth Factor Receptors;Health Care Costs;Heterogeneity;Immune;Immunocompetent;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Infiltration;Lead;MAPK3 gene;MEK inhibition;MEKs;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Melanoma Cell;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutate;NRG1 gene;Neural Crest;Neuregulins;Oncogenic;PD-1/PD-L1;Pathway interactions;Patients;Population;Protein Dephosphorylation;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Proteins;Regimen;Regulation;Research;Resistance;Role;Schedule;Signal Transduction;Skin Cancer;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Threonine;Toxic effect;Translations;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Up-Regulation;anti-PD-1/PD-L1;anti-PD-L1;anti-PD-L1 antibodies;base;cancer therapy;combinatorial;cost;driver mutation;effective therapy;experimental study;health care delivery;immune activation;immune checkpoint;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;melanoma;mortality;mutant;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;programmed cell death ligand 1;response;side effect;single cell analysis;small molecule inhibitor;targeted treatment;transcription factor;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment	THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	Andrew E Aplin	DCTD	SUNDARESAN  VENKATACHALAM	370500	$250k to $499k	370500	15-Jul-2021	1-Jun-2012	31-Jul-2023	PA-16-160	Moonshot

A much larger number of tumors have amplifications or deletions of these genes. These complexes are polymorphic assemblies of 15 subunits encoded by 28 genes giving rise to remarkable combinatorial specificity. This biologic specificity is reflected in the highly selective pattern of oncogenic mutations in specific subunits in specific cancers. Cancer mutations generally have the characteristics of tumor suppressors and are generally heterozygous, implying that they play a genetically dominant role in suppressing tumor formation. Work in our lab and others has led to the conclusion that the ability of these complexes to oppose polycomb-mediated repression contributes to their roles in both development and oncogenesis. Hence, we will focus our work on the mechanisms underlying the opposition between BAF and polycomb and its therapeutic consequences. First we will use a novel, newly designed in vivo chromatin remodeling assay to fully characterize the nature of the opposition on a minute-by- minute basis. Secondly, we will define the energetic requirements for BAF-polycomb opposition and the essential role of ATP in regulating binding and release of PRC1 from BAF. Third, we will fully characterize the direct interaction between BAF and polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in terms of subunits and domains that are essential for this interaction. Fourth, we will explore the consequences of disruption of BAF-polycomb opposition for repair, recombination and transcription over the genome. Finally, we will define the therapeutic potential of a group of small molecule BAF inhibitors that we identified in earlier screens. At the conclusion of these studies we should have a mechanistic understanding of BAF-polycomb opposition and have explored at least two potential paths for the production of cancer-specific drugs. 	ATPase Domain;Amino Acids;Binding;Biological Assay;Characteristics;Chromatin;Complex;Dependence;Development;Gene Deletion;Genes;Genetic Recombination;Genetic Transcription;Genetic study;Genome;Grant;Human;Human Genetics;Investigation;Kinetics;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Missense Mutation;Molecular;Mutation;Nature;Normal Cell;Oncogenic;PRC1 Protein;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Polycomb;Production;Proteins;Recurrence;Repression;Role;Specificity;Surface;System;Techniques;Therapeutic;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Work;base;cancer cell;chromatin remodeling;combinatorial;design;early screening;exome sequencing;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;novel;repaired;small molecule;tool;tumor;tumorigenesis	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	STANFORD	CA	UNITED STATES	Gerald R.

project	5R01CA175397-05	R01CA175397	9331455	2017	Cancer-associated fibroblast in the regulation of bladder cancer stem cells	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer, the fifth most common malignancy in the U.S. with approximately 70,000 new cases diagnosed each year, is essentially incurable after it has begun to progress. Much of the difficulty lies in the scarcity of mechanistic insightsin the functional involvement of the fibroblastic microenvironment, and its interactions with the epithelial cancer compartment in modulating early bladder cancer invasion. The applicant and his collaborators have made considerable strides in closing this gap. They were among the first to isolate and characterize human bladder cancer stem cells.  Recently, they showed that an expansion of phenotypic cancer stem cells correlates with a poorer clinical outcome and bladder cancer invasion.  Their proposal aims to extend these findings by elucidating the functional contribution of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the modulation of bladder cancer stem cells and tumor progression. This application has its foundation via demonstrating that bladder cancer patients with an elevated expression of CAF genes also have muscle-invasive cancer and a poorer survival.  Moreover, activated CAFs localize immediately adjacent to phenotypic cancer stem cells, suggesting a possible functional interaction between these two cell types.  Additional findings indicate an important role of collagen I (COL1) excreted by CAFs, which can bind to discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (DDR1) on bladder cancer cells and modulate their tumorigenic properties.  This progress has led to a novel working hypothesis - that COL1-DDR1 signaling between activated CAFs and bladder cancer cells is one of the mechanisms exerted by CAFs to regulate cancer stem cells and tumor progression. Three specific research aims will be pursued.  Aim 1 seeks to establish the functional involvement of CAFs in the regulation of cancer stem cells and tumor progression, with an emphasis on using primary patient specimens.  To further define the clinical significance of CAFs, we will utilize tw independent patient cohorts to assess the expression of CAFs/COL1 in relation to bladder cancer differentiation and selected clinical prognostic information.  Aim 2 will employ both gain-of-function and loss-of-function strategies to define the functional contributions of DDR1 on bladder cancer cells to mediate the biological properties promoted by CAFs.  These studies will be aided by the availability of newly isolated bladder CAFs and the applicant's expertise in isolating cancer stem cells for subsequent analysis. Finally, Aim 3 will access Stat3 and additional downstream mechanisms related to DDR1, using established proteomics profiling approach.  The applicant intends to uncover druggable targets within this pathway for early bladder cancer intervention, as the long-term goal of this proposal.

While the initial steps of the metastatic cascade are rather well defined, identification of targets to block this process remains a major clinical challenge. Previous studies have elegantly investigated the mechanistic contribution of tumor cell intrinsic properties that promote metastasis in bladder urothelial carcinomas. However, the functional significance of the tumor microenvironment and its contribution to this complicated process is not well characterized, and therefore, warrants investigation. The long-term goal of this renewal application is to continue explore how collagens—a major extracellular matrix component of the microenvironment—act as a ligand to mediate crosstalk with their receptor on tumor cells to facilitate the metastatic cascade. We will investigate the downstream regulatory mechanisms of collagen receptor signaling in both the primary tumor and metastatic sites, and to exploit these regulatory processes as a revolutionizing approach to target metastases. Such innovative approaches to perturb collagen-cancer crosstalk—not only at the primary tumor but also at the metastatic niche—will move the field forward by providing a new conception in metastatic disease management, and likely extend beyond bladder carcinomas to other cancer types.

Current treatment options are of limited effectiveness; thus, there is a pressing need for new therapies for this disease. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the histone methyltransferase DOT1L is required for the development and maintenance of MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemia in model systems. Likewise, work from the previous funding cycle clearly defined a role for DOT1L inhibition in MLL-r leukemia through characterization of a potent, specific DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ-5676 (pinometostat), that has remarkably selective anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on MLL-rearranged cells. As pinometostat has progressed through Phase I clinical trials, responses and subsequent relapses imply the development of acquired resistance to the inhibitor. In this proposal, we seek to understand the biological underpinnings of DOT1L inhibitor resistance and develop a novel class of small molecule DOT1L degraders to overcome resistance. In Specific Aim 1, we seek to understand the mechanisms of resistance through detailed studies of chromatin structure and gene expression following the development of acquired resistance to DOT1L inhibitor therapy. We will also investigate the non-enzymatic role of DOT1L in MLL-r leukemia and define dependencies acquired in the resistant state. In Specific Aim 2, we will lead a chemistry and chemical biology campaign and develop an assay platform for the identification and optimization of the first small molecule degraders of endogenous DOT1L protein. In Specific Aim 3, we will utilize our cell culture and patient-derived xenograft models of MLL-r leukemia to explore the impact of DOT1L degradation on gene expression and tumor progression while driving hit-to-lead optimization of DOT1L degraders that can prompt clinical investigation. We will also test pharmacological hypotheses regarding combinatorial drug action with DOT1L degraders in predictive human models of MLL-r leukemia. We expect these aims to bring new more efficacious, less toxic therapies to children and adults diagnosed with this devastating disease.

Our laboratory has reported in vivo-like IGF- 1R/mTOR expression patterns, closely related to those observed in human Ewing sarcoma tumors (ES), when established ES cell lines are grown upon innovative biologically inert 3D electrospun poly(�-caprolactone) (PCL) microfiber scaffolds rather than upon traditional plastic monolayers. The present proposal seeks to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions stimulate an activated IGF- 1R/mTOR signaling state within this engineered 3D bone tumor microenvironment, as those interactions are critically important in initiating and maintaining ES. In parallel with determining the influence of those parameters under static cell culture, 3D scaffolds and culture conditions will be adapted to better emulate the native bone microenvironment: (a) varied flow perfusion rates will be used to assess the effect of shear stress upon cell retention while facilitating uniform distribution of Ewing cells within the scaffold, (b) PCL scaffolds will incorporate IGF-1 to mimic the high concentration of IGF-1 naturally released as tumors invade surrounding bone, (c) the effect of an osteogenic ECM upon the IGF-1R/mTOR signaling cascade will be determined using decellularized scaffolds upon which heterotypic mesenchymal stem cells, differentiated toward an osteoblastic lineage, are first grown, and (d) ES cells will be co-cultured with endothelial cells (EC) to determine how heterotypic cells interact within a fabricated 3D bone tumor model to elicit viable ES tumors. Finally, to determine the mechanism(s) by which Ewing sarcoma evades sensitivity to combined mTOR/IGF-1R targeted therapy, freshly-derived tumor specimens (obtained from Ewing sarcoma patients treated with Medi- 573/everolimus in an IRB-approved clinical trial), will be grown in primary culture within 3D scaffolds and compared to 2D culture and patient-derived tumor explants (PDTX) by proteomic analysis of the IGF- 1R/mTOR pathway and putative resistance mechanisms. This novel approach of studying Ewing sarcoma within an ex vivo preclinical model of the bone microenvironment presents tremendous potential for understanding chemotherapeutic efficacy and for determining resistance mechanisms to biologically targeted therapies.

Both Mdm2 and Mdmx bind and are direct regulators of the p53 tumor suppressor, but their regulation of p53 activation is only partially understood. Moreover, Mdm2 and Mdmx also have other oncogenic functions that are not well characterized and that likely impact p53 activation and significantly contribute to tumorigenesis. Specifically, altered expression of either Mdm2 or Mdmx can lead to genome instability, which is a hallmark of cancer and facilitator of tumor development; however, the mechanisms for this remain unresolved and appear to have both p53-dependent and p53-independent components. Preliminary data suggest novel mechanisms of Mdm2 and Mdmx in the regulation of p53 and the DNA damage response. Therefore, we hypothesize that alterations in these functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx significantly contribute to their oncogenic activity that leads to genome instability and tumor development. We propose to investigate this hypothesis with three Specific Aims. Experiments in Aim 1 utilize innovative approaches to define the novel functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx that result in genome instability during tumorigenesis and the proteins and pathways required. Experiments in Aim 2 will evaluate a novel mechanism of p53 regulation by Mdm2 and Mdmx with multiple approaches, including a new mouse model. Experiments in Aim 3 will capitalize on the novel functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx in targeting an Achilles' heel in cancer cells, and will identify synthetic lethal combination for cells that have lost a functional Mdm2/Mdmx-p53 pathway. Results from these Aims will reveal critical insights into the oncogenic functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx and their roles in tumorigenesis. Our studies should also open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of the 50% of human cancers that have inactivated p53.

project	5R01CA182543-05	R01CA182543	9221976	2017	Biosensor Assay to Screen for Signaling Pathway Inhibition in Cancer	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kinase inhibitors created a new paradigm in chemotherapy and are a major focus of new oncology drug development, but developmental success rates are low (5-10%). Resistance to kinase inhibitors occurs through target-dependent mechanisms (e.g. point mutations that abrogate drug binding) and target-independent mechanisms (e.g. upregulation of alternative signaling pathways, termed "kinome reprogramming"). Therefore, combinations of inhibitors that target several kinases at once are desirable to have a better chance of avoiding the resistance/relapse cycle. Detecting protein kinase activity inside living cells (rather than in lysates or reconstituted systems) is important or understanding kinase inhibitor drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and would lead to better screening for inhibitors likely to make it through the development process. We will develop multiplexed, cell-based assays for specific kinase activities that are important to inhibitor response and kinome reprogramming, and use them to detect kinase activation profiles in patient cells and for inhibitor screens. Phosphorylation of the biosensors is detected using time-resolved lanthanide luminescence measurements, in which Tb3+ emission energy is measured directly via small molecule fluorophores to give different emission colors depending on the fluorophore. In Aim 1, we will establish quantitative assays for activity (and therefore inhibition) of key kinases in drug sensitive and drug resistant CML cells, profiling the pathway activation phenotypes in therapeutically relevant cellular states. We will use the set of biosensors we have already established in preliminary work, and add biosensors for other kinases as they are developed. The assays will be established with cell lines and samples from CML patients (comparing to healthy controls), and validated with RT-qPCR and SWATH" proteomics. In Aim 2, we will screen for synergies between existing kinase inhibitor drugs and new compounds (via libraries). We will also develop homogenous multiplexed analysis of biosensor phosphorylation using energy transfer from lanthanides to organic dyes. In Aim 3, we expand the biosensor design pipeline to develop new, non-natural peptide substrates to use as biosensors for other kinases. The work described in this aim will add to the set of biosensors we already have available. Completion of the work described in this proposal will give us a novel assay for multiple kinases, a suite of new biosensors as well as new and refined detection strategies to use in screening. Drug discovery will benefit from this technology's ability to address kinome reprogramming mechanisms by targeting several kinases at a time. Drug development will benefit from companion assays for multiple targets that could follow a drug or drug combination through the hit to lead transition, target validation, pre-clinical studies, clinial trials, and beyond into treatment management. This assay and its associated tools will contribute to the next generation of targeted therapy development in cancer by breaking new ground in our ability to model the disease environment during drug screening and development.

project	5R01CA187076-04	R01CA187076	9319538	2017	The role of the PI3K pathway in immune resistance	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple immunotherapies have demonstrated long-term clinical benefit in patients with melanoma. Clinical trials are currently underway to build upon this activity in melanoma, and to see if similar benefits can be achieved in other cancers. Despite the advances made over the last few years, there is currently limited understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy. An improved understanding of resistance may identify patients that are most likely to benefit from current immunotherapies. Further, identification of resistance mechanisms that are targetable may lead to combinations that are more effective. Previously we demonstrated that targeting BRAFV600 mutations, which are the most common somatic alterations in melanoma, increases the efficacy of immune-mediated killing of tumors through multiple mechanisms, leading to ongoing clinical trials. Recently, we have found evidence that loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which occurs in 20-30% of melanomas with BRAFV600 mutations, may also contribute to resistance to immunotherapy. Our preliminary experiments show that loss of PTEN in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells inhibits T-cell mediated killing of melanomas in vitro , decreases intratumoral accumulation of tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) in vivo, and correlates with reduced success of TIL expansion from patients. Our data also demonstrates that loss of PTEN correlates with inferior clinical outcomes among BRAF-mutant melanoma patients, reinforcing the clinical significance of this subpopulation. Loss of PTEN results in marked activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, a pathway for which many targeted agents are available and currently undergoing clinical testing. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the PI3K-AKT pathway in tumor cells is the critical mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy in BRAF-mutant melanomas, and that inhibition of this pathway will increase the efficacy of T-cell mediated immunotherapy. In order to test this hypothesis, we will utilize multiple unique clinical and preclinical resources that we have established to develop more effective therapeutic approaches for melanoma patients. First, we will utilize our preclinical models and diagnostic platforms to interrogate the mechanisms that underlie resistance to T-cell mediated killing and trafficking of T cells to melanoma with loss of PTEN. Second, we will analyze specimens from several cohorts of melanoma patients to determine the immunological features and immunotherapy treatment outcomes associated with PTEN loss. Finally, we will determine the effects of PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors, alone and in combination with FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors, on T-cell viability, function, and anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vio. Together these studies will improve our understanding of the role and therapeutic potential of the PI3K-AKT pathway in resistance to immunotherapy in melanoma. Further, as the PI3K-AKT pathway is implicated in multiple tumor types in which immunotherapies are being tested, the findings may have broad applications for cancer patients.

First, we will utilize our preclinical models and diagnostic platforms to interrogate the mechanisms that underlie resistance to T-cell mediated killing and trafficking of T cells to melanoma with loss of PTEN. Second, we will analyze specimens from several cohorts of melanoma patients to determine the immunological features and immunotherapy treatment outcomes associated with PTEN loss. Finally, we will determine the effects of PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors, alone and in combination with FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors, on T-cell viability, function, and anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vio. Together these studies will improve our understanding of the role and therapeutic potential of the PI3K-AKT pathway in resistance to immunotherapy in melanoma. Further, as the PI3K-AKT pathway is implicated in multiple tumor types in which immunotherapies are being tested, the findings may have broad applications for cancer patients.

project	5R01CA187532-03	R01CA187532	9228985	2017	Imaging Habitats in Sarcoma	Grant	﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tissue cancers, with over 50 histological sub-types. Regardless of type, virtually all STS are treated the same; i.e. with doxorubicin (DOX) followed by resection, if possible. More than 20% of STS are non-resectable and, of those that are, more than 20% recur. For non-resectable or recurring patients, median survival is a dismal 18 months. Perhaps because of its rarity, no new front-line agents have been developed for STS in decades. Among newer agents being developed for STS, TH-302 is showing exceptional promise. TH-302 is an alkylating pro-drug that is activated only in regions of severe hypoxia, and is currently in a phas III trial in combination with DOX in unresectable STS. The primary endpoint of this trial is overal survival with a secondary endpoint of objective radiological response with RECIST 1.1. RECIST responses rarely correlate with survival responses in soft tissue sarcomas, however. The purpose of this work is to develop MR imaging biomarkers that can predict response to DOX and/or TH-302, with the overarching hypothesis that distinct MRI-defined sub-regions of tumors will have differential responses to these agents. Because these sub-regions are defined by their distinct physiology illuminated by combining multiple MR scans, we have termed these as distinct "habitats". Because TH-302 is active only in hypoxia, and hypoxia should be represented by a specific habitat, we specifically hypothesize that imaging of the hypoxic habitat can be used to predict and monitor responses to TH-302. The hypoxia habitat is classified as having low perfusion and high cell density. In contrast, the DOX-responsive habitat should be well perfused (yielding higher drug concentrations) and have high cell density (with more drug targets). This represents a conceptual advance as such habitats may provide a common predictive biomarker across the multiple histological sub-types of STS for patient stratification and therapeutic decision support. The approach will follow on preliminary work, wherein delineated habitats were quantitatively identified across multiple histological types and grades of STS by combining T1, contrast- enhanced T1, and T2 STIR MR images. The current proposal is entirely pre-clinical, with the expectation that findings herein can be rapidly translated to clinial care. Preclinical work is justified in that there is greater flexibility to interrogate a wider porfolio of MRI pulse sequences and treatment strategies that can be related to underlying histology and molecular profiling. Aim 1 will quantitatively compare MR-visible habitats to histology and molecular profiles of xenotransplanted tumors. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that tumors with different habitat profiles will be differentially responsive to DOX and/or TH-302. In Aim 3, we wil investigate the effects of metabolic perturbations to affect the hypoxic habitat and thus improve response to TH-302. At the end of this study, we will have developed a new set of MR imaging biomarkers for predicting and monitoring response in this heterogeneous group of diseases, with the expectation that these finding will inform a follow-on study in the clinic.

While a great deal of effort has focused on new therapeutic approaches for EOC patients, EOC mortality rates have not markedly improved over the past decades. There is increasing interest in developing novel immunotherapeutic strategies, which require correlative studies to identify targets and patients who are most likely to benefit from these therapies. In the proposed study, we intend to study previously unexplored immune markers as predictors for outcomes among invasive serous EOC patients. Our preliminary results show that in patients with advanced EOC, mitochondrial products of cellular damage are released into the extracellular environment where they activate neutrophils. These stimulated neutrophils generate reactive oxidants and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a distinct mode of neutrophil death characterized by breakdown of membranes and extracellular release of stretches of DNA, histones, and proteases. While NETs function to defend against infection, in the tumor microenvironment, they are expected to facilitate invasion and metastasis. We will study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as a measure of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and their relationship to NETs in women with invasive serous EOC. We propose in Specific Aim 1 to evaluate the role of mtDNA levels in paired pre-treatment serum and ascites samples in predicting relapse within the first year, PFS and OS in patients with advanced serous EOC. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of neutrophils and NET markers in blood, ascites and tumors in invasive serous EOC outcomes. In Specific Aim 3, we intend to develop a new prognostic signature for patients with advanced serous EOC that incorporates the independent and combined effects of mtDNA, NET markers, and standard prognostic variables. To accomplish these Specific Aims, we will take advantage of, and expand on, an established collaborative infrastructure for sample collection and banking procedures to support evaluation of novel prognostic biomarkers for EOC. We will utilize a cohort of patients currently being recruited at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) to develop the prognostic signature, and similarly treated patients being enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) will be an independent validation cohort for findings in Specific Aim 3. Accomplishment of these aims will establish novel immune-based biomarkers for prognosis in EOC, and may create the foundation for new targets for immunotherapy.

project	5R01CA192914-03	R01CA192914	9237209	2017	Tension-Stat3-miR-mediated metastasis	Grant	﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) exhibit aggressive tumor biology and carry a poor prognosis, particularly in premenopausal African American (AA) women who carry a disproportionate burden of breast cancer mortality. The precursor lesion for TNBC is poorly characterized and the pathophysiology of TNBC is not well understood so therapies often fail to achieve complete pathological response and the disease is frequently non-curative. This proposal aims to clarify the molecular pathology of TNBC so that biomarkers for early diagnosis, prevention strategies and curative therapies can be developed. In our high-risk, multi-institutional cohort, with a high percent of AA women, we found that during breast cancer initiation, pStat3 is high as is ECM stiffness and integrin/YAP mechanosignaling, and miRNAs implicated in tumor progression/aggression. TNBCs had the highest inflammation, pStat3 and miR-18a, the stiffest ECM and the lowest miR-203. Mouse studies indicated preventing inflammation decreases fibrosis and that reducing ECM stiffening lower pStat3 and inflammation and EMT and metastasis. Driving mammary mechanosignaling induced miR-18a and EMT and enhanced tumor aggression/metastasis. This suggests that an activated Stat3/tissue tension feedback loop, linked to tissue inflammation, promotes TNBC by engaging mechanosignaling pathways that alter miRs and induce an EMT and tumor aggression. While some breast cancers arise from focal lesions, TNBCs often appear to arise diffusely. We predict that in women at high-risk for TNBC (familial association, BRCA1 mutation) there is a dynamic and reciprocal relationship between the "at risk epithelium" and tissue tension that activates mechano-signaling pathways and induces Stat3/miRNA to 1) initiate TNBC, 3) induce an EMT and/or enhance tumor aggression, that 3) can be used to idenify precancerous lesions that have a high likelihood of progression to TNBC, and 4) could be used to monitor efficacy of prevention strategies and identify targets to improve TNBC treatment. We will use preclinical models to test: 1) if there is a reciprocal relationship between inflammation, pStat3 and tissue tension that promotes TNBC progression/aggression and 2) if this is mediated through miRs and EMT. We will examine a clinical cohort of high risk women who rapidly develop TNBCs to 3) test the prevalence of this signaling circuit in biopsies from women with TNBC and determine whether these biomarkers can identify precancerous lesions that have a high likelihood of progression to TNBC.

The precursor lesion for TNBC is poorly characterized and the pathophysiology of TNBC is not well understood so therapies often fail to achieve complete pathological response and the disease is frequently non-curative. This proposal aims to clarify the molecular pathology of TNBC so that biomarkers for early diagnosis, prevention strategies and curative therapies can be developed. In our high-risk, multi-institutional cohort, with a high percent of AA women, we found that during breast cancer initiation, pStat3 is high as is ECM stiffness and integrin/YAP mechanosignaling, and miRNAs implicated in tumor progression/aggression. TNBCs had the highest inflammation, pStat3 and miR-18a, the stiffest ECM and the lowest miR-203. Mouse studies indicated preventing inflammation decreases fibrosis and that reducing ECM stiffening lower pStat3 and inflammation and EMT and metastasis. Driving mammary mechanosignaling induced miR-18a and EMT and enhanced tumor aggression/metastasis. This suggests that an activated Stat3/tissue tension feedback loop, linked to tissue inflammation, promotes TNBC by engaging mechanosignaling pathways that alter miRs and induce an EMT and tumor aggression. While some breast cancers arise from focal lesions, TNBCs often appear to arise diffusely. We predict that in women at high-risk for TNBC (familial association, BRCA1 mutation) there is a dynamic and reciprocal relationship between the "at risk epithelium" and tissue tension that activates mechano-signaling pathways and induces Stat3/miRNA to 1) initiate TNBC, 3) induce an EMT and/or enhance tumor aggression, that 3) can be used to idenify precancerous lesions that have a high likelihood of progression to TNBC, and 4) could be used to monitor efficacy of prevention strategies and identify targets to improve TNBC treatment. We will use preclinical models to test: 1) if there is a reciprocal relationship between inflammation, pStat3 and tissue tension that promotes TNBC progression/aggression and 2) if this is mediated through miRs and EMT. We will examine a clinical cohort of high risk women who rapidly develop TNBCs to 3) test the prevalence of this signaling circuit in biopsies from women with TNBC and determine whether these biomarkers can identify precancerous lesions that have a high likelihood of progression to TNBC. Significance: Our studies could transform concepts of breast cancer by demonstrating that tissue tension could molecularly-prime tissue to malignancy. Markers that identify preneoplastic changes in TNBC, that could be used to monitor efficacy of risk reduction strategies, would have a transformative impact on TNBC mortality rates and particularly AA women.

In contrast to most other cancer treatments, immunotherapy can induce durable clinical response in metastatic disease. Antibodies targeting PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 have shown significant clinical activity in multiple diseases. Importantly, dramatic clinical responses have been seen in patients with the metastatic bladder, a disease in which no new drugs have been approved for over 20 years. The mechanism by which these immunotherapies work in cancer patients is unknown, nor are there robust biomarkers that predict of response to these treatments.  We will perform a clinical study administering anti-PD-L1 antibody in patients with localized bladder cancer prior to these patients undergoing planned surgery for their cancer. We propose to study the effects of anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment not just in the blood but within the actual tumor. We will determine whether this immunotherapy increases the number of T cells into the tumor by examining tissues from biopsies obtained before treatment and from the bladder tumor resected following treatment. We will use next generation sequencing to track individual T cell clones in the blood and tumors to also determine whether T cells present in the tumor are being recruited to the tumor site or were already at the tumor. We will study how this treatment activates a systemic immune response.  Understanding how these treatments work within patients, including at the level of the tumor tissue, will provide avenues t improve the efficacy of this approach and/or develop biomarkers to identify those patients that can benefit from treatment. Moreover, if significant tumor regression is seen, this treatment approach could transform our approach to localized bladder cancer. Finally, the clinical and laboratory findings derived from this trial may also help transform in how metastatic bladder cancer could be treated and contribute significantly to the design of future clinical trials with P-L1 and/or PD-1 targeted drugs.

CN-AML represents nearly 50% of human AML cases, and the overall 5-year survival for adults with CN-AML is approximately 30%. Mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and internal tandem duplications of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) and are two of the most frequent events in CN-AML. Moreover, recent whole-genome sequencing of CN-AML patient samples identified: 1) high-frequency co-occurrence of FLT3 and DNMT3A mutations, and 2) corresponding changes to the risk classification for these CN-AML patients to a poorer prognosis. Because human epidemiologic studies cannot easily control for factors that confer disease risk, genetically engineered mouse (GEM) strains provide essential tractable platforms to mechanistically dissect disease pathobiology, heterogeneity and therapeutic response. Although neither Flt3-ITD nor inducible deletion of Dnmt3a induces spontaneous leukemia in mice, when we combined Flt3-ITD mutant alleles with inducible deletion of Dnmt3a we find a spontaneous, rapidly lethal, completely-penetrant, and transplantable AML. We hypothesize that inducible deletion of Dnmt3a in Flt3-ITD mice produces a faithful model of human CN-AML that can be used to infer essential biological and molecular factors that constitute therapeutic response. To this end, we propose, genomic, cytogenetic, and single-cell molecular analyses (with comparison to primary human CN-AML) to deconvolute both the tumor architecture and the underlying cellular states.

project	5R01CA197363-02	R01CA197363	9451249	2018	Anti-Tumor Mechanisms of Intratumoral Stimulatory Dendritic Cells	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract Treating the immune response within tumors is a major focus of new therapeutic development. Much of the focus has been place on T cells, in particular via checkpoint therapies such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1. Little is currently known of how individual populations of myeloid cells can be partners for T cells. We have recently isolated rare populations of myeloid cells that appear critical for robust responses but we don't yet fully understand how they work. We hypothesize that rare stimulatory dendritic cells traffic antigens and stimulate T cell according to specialized rules and that harnessing and modulation of this pathway is part of the reason that checkpoint blockades may work. We further hypothesize that specific tissue-based cells are responsible for upregulating the critical cytokine to make stimulatory dendritic cells but that tissue production is dysregulated in cancer and possibly improved with checkpoint therapies. In this proposal we will be vastly extending an approach that my lab has been pursuing over the last few years. Specifically we will be extending our cell-biology based studies of these critical cells (Aim1) to understand how they play a fundamental role in antigen trafficking. Additionally, we will seek to understand how they hand off antigen to other antigen-presenting cells in the lymph node to engage T cells (Aim2) and how both of these processes are affected by checkpoint blockades. Finally, in aim 3, we will seek to understand the normal and intratumoral production of the cytokine Flt3L, a key player in regulating the number of these rare cells. At the end of this work, we will understand how these intratumoral myeloid cells function on their own and in concert with T cell therapies.

Much of the focus has been place on T cells, in particular via checkpoint therapies such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1. Little is currently known of how individual populations of myeloid cells can be partners for T cells. We have recently isolated rare populations of myeloid cells that appear critical for robust responses but we don't yet fully understand how they work. We hypothesize that rare stimulatory dendritic cells traffic antigens and stimulate T cell according to specialized rules and that harnessing and modulation of this pathway is part of the reason that checkpoint blockades may work. We further hypothesize that specific tissue-based cells are responsible for upregulating the critical cytokine to make stimulatory dendritic cells but that tissue production is dysregulated in cancer and possibly improved with checkpoint therapies. In this proposal we will be vastly extending an approach that my lab has been pursuing over the last few years. Specifically we will be extending our cell-biology based studies of these critical cells (Aim1) to understand how they play a fundamental role in antigen trafficking. Additionally, we will seek to understand how they hand off antigen to other antigen-presenting cells in the lymph node to engage T cells (Aim2) and how both of these processes are affected by checkpoint blockades. Finally, in aim 3, we will seek to understand the normal and intratumoral production of the cytokine Flt3L, a key player in regulating the number of these rare cells. At the end of this work, we will understand how these intratumoral myeloid cells function on their own and in concert with T cell therapies.

The intimate relationship between gammaherpesviruses and B cell differentiation is directly linked to the lymphomagenic capacity of these viruses. To ensure the establishment of long-term latency in memory B cells, gammaherpesviruses drive a unique polyclonal germinal center reaction during early infection. Germinal center reaction represents a stage of B cell differentiation that is characterized by rapid division of activated B cells along with genetic instability driven by enzymes that either induce DNA breaks or mutagenize DNA. It is not surprising that most Epstein-Barr virus-driven B cell lymphomas originate from germinal center or post germinal center B cells. This robust, gammaherpesvirus-stimulated germinal center reaction is transient and returns to near-baseline levels in long-term infected hosts. Importantly, it is not clear what attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. We have identified Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 (IRF-1) as the first host factor that specifically attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. Studies proposed here test the hypothesis that IRF-1 is the critical host factor that attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven expansion and transformation of germinal center B cells throughout life-long infection. The proposed studies will define IRF-1-mediated signaling changes that attenuate gammaherpesvirus-driven expansion of germinal center response and the relative contributions of B- and T cell-intrinsic functions of IRF-1 to this process. Further, proposed studies will develop a novel animal model of gammaherpesvirus lymphomagenesis. Successful completion of the proposed studies will offer insights into the tumor suppressor mechanisms of IRF-1 and generate novel animal models that will be of value to infectious disease, immunology, and cancer fields.

Small animal, and in particular mouse, model systems are attractive to researchers for numerous reasons, including their ease of use and well-described platforms. Immunotherapy has revolutionized clinical oncology, but lacks pre-clinical models of the human immune system and human cancer to investigate new modalities and limitations/toxicities of treatment regimens. The ability to grow human tumors in immunodeficient mice (so-called patient-derived xenografts, or PDXs) allows researchers to work directly with human cancer tissue in a controlled setting. However, PDX models are limited by their lack of an intact immune system. The broad objective of this proposal is to validate an in vivo model to evaluate human tumors in the context of a complete and intact human immune system in a completely personalized and autologous fashion. Herein, we propose to: (1) validate the ability to establish humanized mice from patients with melanoma; (2) evaluate tumor growth and lymphocyte development in autologous human melanoma tumors established in humanized mice; and (3) validate the ability of this humanized system to serve as a model for cancer immunotherapy treatment response and toxicity. In each of these areas, we will leverage our multi- institutional team's individual expertise along with our institutional infrastructure to maximize the success of the experimental aims. Furthermore, we will participate in the Oncology Models Forum and utilize the NCIP Hub resources to ensure that the methodology, data, and biologic model systems that result from this project are made widely available to the general research community for future, hypothesis-driven research. Taken together, the studies described in this research proposal will meet multiple goals and address several unmet needs identified in this grant opportunity, thus significantly enhancing the applicability of a fully autologous and immunocompetent precision model system for use in translational oncology research.

project	5R01CA204136-02	R01CA204136	9399642	2018	Credentialing murine models for glioblastoma preclinical drug development	Grant	ABSTRACT Precision medicine promises to revolutionize oncology by targeting drugs to specific mutations. However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes. This work will therefore help realize the promise of precision medicine in neuro- oncology.

However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models.

RAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib improved survival of melanoma patients with BRAF(V600E) tumors. Unfortunate- ly, responses are usually temporary, followed by development of resistance, most commonly due to ineffective inhibition of RAF and reactivation of ERK signaling in the presence of the drug. In addition, RAF inhibitors in- duce second site tumors, due to RAS-dependent paradoxical activation of RAF and downstream ERK signaling in normal cells. Outside of melanoma, RAF inhibitors showed limited efficacy in patients colorectal and thyroid BRAF(V600E) tumors, also due to ineffective inhibition of RAF/ERK signaling in these tumors. More recently, combinations of RAF and MEK inhibitors showed improved efficacy compared to RAF inhibitor monotherapy, but resistance eventually emerges as well. Resistance mechanisms identified to the RAF/MEK inhibitor combi- nation are similar to the ones identified for RAF inhibitor monotherapy, suggesting that ineffective inhibition of RAF is a critical limiting factor in both contexts. There is thus a pressing need for improved therapeutic strate- gies targeting oncogenic BRAF, such that durable responses and minimal side effects can be achieved. Our previous work showed that regulation of BRAF kinase by dimerization determines both the development of re- sistance to currently used RAF inhibitors and inhibitor-induced RAF paradoxical activation, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Recently, next generation RAF inhibitors with different structural and biochemical properties have entered preclinical and clinical development, but the most appropriate clinical context for their use is unknown. The goal of this proposal is to accomplish a detailed understanding of the mechanisms governing the targeting of oncogenic BRAF by small molecules inhibitors and to use this knowledge in order to design more effective RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies. More specifically, we will 1) characterize the mechanistic basis of resistance to RAF inhibitors due to BRAF dimerization by linking the conformational changes induced by inhibitor binding to BRAF to the biochemical effects of the inhibitor, 2) gain a detailed understanding of the biochemical mechanism of paradoxical RAF activation by inhibitors in cells with wild-type BRAF and 3) identify effective RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies for tumors with dimeric BRAF that would overcome RAF dimer-mediated intrinsic or acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors. The mech- anistic insights gained by the proposed experiments will enable the rational design of more effective small mol- ecule inhibitors and RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies targeting oncogenic BRAF signaling, with mini- mal side effects and prolonged time to resistance.

Resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and apoptosis is the dominant cause of treatment failure. The molecular mechanisms responsible for chemotherapy resistance are poorly understood, hindering the development of therapeutic strategies to induce chemosensitivity. We have found that chemotherapy and apoptosis resistance in high-risk AML requires aberrant phosphorylation of MEF2C, a key transcriptional regulator of leukemia cell growth and survival. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that defining the apoptotic mechanisms dysregulated by aberrant MEF2C signaling will reveal effective therapeutic strategies to overcome treatment resistance. The applicant, who is a New Investigator, will test this hypothesis by investigating the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis resistance in primary human and genetically-engineered mouse leukemias. Aim 1 will elucidate both transcriptional and cellular mechanisms of therapy resistance, with the goal of identifying MEF2C targets that are necessary and sufficient for chemoresistance. Aim 2 will pursue the preliminary evidence that MARK family kinases aberrantly phosphorylate MEF2C and devise rational combination strategies to overcome chemotherapy resistance induced by MEF2C phosphorylation. Successful completion of this project is expected to yield molecular mechanisms of aberrant survival and chemotherapy resistance of high-risk AML, thus providing essential insights into a fundamental biological and clinical problem, which can be rapidly translated into clinical trials for patients with this disease.	1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Adult;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Biological;Biological Markers;Cell Survival;Cells;Child;Chromatin;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Combination Drug Therapy;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;DNA Damage;Development;Disease;Epigenetic Process;FLT3 gene;Failure;Family;Gene Mutation;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3;Goals;Grant;Hematopoietic;Human;Immunodeficient Mouse;Knowledge;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mission;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Mutation;NR4A1 gene;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patient Care;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmacology;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Public Health;Recruitment Activity;Refractory;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resistance;SYK gene;Sampling;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specimen;Stem cell transplant;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Failure;United States National Institutes of Health;base;cancer cell;cell growth;chemotherapy;clinical care;clinically relevant;drug metabolism;high risk;improved;innovation;insight;jun Oncogene;leukemia;loss of function mutation;novel;response;therapeutic development;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;transcription factor;treatment strategy	SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Alex  Kentsis	DCTD	Suzanne L Forry	459674	$250k to $499k	459674	31-Jul-2017	22-Aug-2016	31-Jul-2021	PA-13-302	Moonshot

Successful completion of this project is expected to yield molecular mechanisms of aberrant survival and chemotherapy resistance of high-risk AML, thus providing essential insights into a fundamental biological and clinical problem, which can be rapidly translated into clinical trials for patients with this disease.	1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Adult;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Biological;Biological Markers;Cell Survival;Cells;Child;Chromatin;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Combination Drug Therapy;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;DNA Damage;Development;Disease;Epigenetic Process;FLT3 gene;Failure;Family;Gene Mutation;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3;Goals;Grant;Hematopoietic;Human;Human Engineering;Immunodeficient Mouse;Knowledge;Leukemic Cell;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mission;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Mutation;NR4A1 gene;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patient Care;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmacology;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Public Health;Refractory;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resistance;SYK gene;Sampling;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specimen;Stem cell transplant;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Failure;United States National Institutes of Health;acute myeloid leukemia cell;base;cancer cell;cell growth;chemotherapy;clinical care;clinically relevant;drug metabolism;high risk;improved;innovation;insight;jun Oncogene;leukemia;loss of function mutation;novel;recruit;response;therapeutic development;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;transcription factor;treatment strategy	SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Alex  Kentsis	DCTD	Suzanne L Forry	481665	$250k to $499k	481665	29-Jul-2020	22-Aug-2016	31-Jul-2021	PA-13-302	Moonshot
project	5R01CA204915-02	R01CA204915	9406118	2018	Dissecting the Pathogenesis of Ewing Sarcoma with Integrative Genomics	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Ewing sarcoma is a rare tumor that occurs in children and young adults. While Ewing sarcoma is relatively rare, the biology of this disease is also relevant to non-Ewing sarcomas, and to other cancer subtypes, due to the presence of the EWS/FLI translocation, the driving event in this disease. Similar translocations involving ETS transcription factors occur in other malignancies, including prostate cancer. Thus, understanding the biology of Ewing sarcoma may provide insight into many cancer types. We will investigate the role of secondary genetic events in the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma. These secondary events have been identified through next-generation sequencing of primary tumors and cell lines. Specifically, we will evaluate the role of STAG2 in mediating epigenetic and transcriptional changes induced by the driving oncogene in Ewing sarcoma, EWS/FLI. In Aim 1, we will use genomic approaches (RNAseq, ChIPseq, WGS, etc.) to assess the mechanistic role of STAG2 in the regulation of chromatin architecture, transcription, and aneuploidy in Ewing cells. In Aim 2, we will study the role of STAG2 in progression, maintenance and metastasis in Ewing sarcoma, using functional studies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In Aim 3, we will determine whether there is a synthetic lethal dependency on STAG1 when STAG2 is absent in Ewing sarcoma cells. Our central hypothesis is that STAG2 loss plays a key role in the epigenetic reprogramming that drives the oncogenic function of EWS/FLI.

Understanding the genetic basis of response and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors are critical for improving outcomes with current agents and for developing new ones. Patients can undergo dramatic remissions after treatment while others reap no benefit. Furthermore, the immune phenotype shows substantial temperospatial variability and is influenced by multiple variables. The rationale of this project is that there is a fundamental genetic basis underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors that is poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrates that response to immune checkpoint blockade is strongly determined by the tumor mutation landscape and dictated by a specific neoantigen repertoire. We will apply a conceptually and technically innovative, systematic, multidisciplinary, and highly collaborative approach to elucidate the neoantigen landscape underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our contribution here is expected to provide unparalleled mechanistic detail on how immune checkpoint inhibitors function and to provide biomarkers to identify patients who will benefit from PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, building on data showing that resistance may be mediated by immune pressure and immunoediting, we will shed light into how resistance to these drugs develop, providing definitive evidence for causal mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity. Should our work succeed, we envision substantial utility for similar studies for other cancers. Such an understanding will provide great insight into the mechanisms underlying how immune checkpoint blockade works, provide much needed precise biomarkers, and establish a foundation to develop more effective immunotherapy.

project	5R01CA205967-02	R01CA205967	9248342	2017	(PQ5) Investigation of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity of mitochondrial apoptotic sensitivity	Grant	﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inter- and intra-tumoral mitochondrial heterogeneity in response to chemical perturbation in cancer Response to therapy is heterogeneous between tumors of different histology, between different tumors of the same histology, and even among different tumor cells within the same tumor. Much of the cytotoxic response to therapy in cancer is governed by the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that heterogeneity in response at all three of these levels is governed by functional and molecular heterogeneity of mitochondria. BH3 profiling provides a functional measure of how close a cell is to the threshold of apoptosis by measuring mitochondrial sensitivity to BH3 peptides, a property we also refer to as apoptotic "priming". We have previously shown, in both hematologic and solid tumors, that pretreatment baseline priming of patient tumors predicts clinical response to conventional chemotherapy. Our approach to understanding response to targeted therapies is distinct. In contrast to the ubiquitous nature of the DNA and microtubules that are the targets of conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapies attack vulnerabilities that are selectively present in certain cancer cells. To identify where these vulnerabilities exist, we briefly (less than 24 hours) expose cancer cells to drugs and measure whether the drugs increase apoptotic priming. We have shown that this approach, which we call dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), can predict death of tumor cells from targeted agents in vitro and in vivo for both hematologic and solid tumors. There are two important advantages of DBP over conventional measures of cytotoxicity. First, DBP can be applied much more efficiently to primary patient samples. Experiments measuring cytotoxicity in cancer cells often require days of culture. Because the long-term culture of primary patient samples is so unreliable, cytotoxic measurements in primary tumors are unreliable. DBP requires no more than a day of ex vivo culture since we measure well before frank cell death occurs, and we have demonstrated its predictive power in primary liquid and solid tumors. Second, there are many useful anti-cancer agents that do not cause frank cell death, but which nonetheless provoke apoptotic signaling that facilitates killing in combination regimens. Classical cytotoxic measurements do not identify these, but DBP does. We propose to study intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity based on differential response to compounds that sensitize mitochondria for apoptosis. We will focus on colon cancer tumors, as we have access to primary and PDX specimens of these tumors. Our main goals are to develop a therapeutic toolbox of potentially useful drugs, determine how best to combine these in a personalized way, and also to understand the molecular basis of the heterogeneity of mitochondrial function that underlies differences in response to these drugs.

BH3 profiling provides a functional measure of how close a cell is to the threshold of apoptosis by measuring mitochondrial sensitivity to BH3 peptides, a property we also refer to as apoptotic "priming". We have previously shown, in both hematologic and solid tumors, that pretreatment baseline priming of patient tumors predicts clinical response to conventional chemotherapy. Our approach to understanding response to targeted therapies is distinct. In contrast to the ubiquitous nature of the DNA and microtubules that are the targets of conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapies attack vulnerabilities that are selectively present in certain cancer cells. To identify where these vulnerabilities exist, we briefly (less than 24 hours) expose cancer cells to drugs and measure whether the drugs increase apoptotic priming. We have shown that this approach, which we call dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), can predict death of tumor cells from targeted agents in vitro and in vivo for both hematologic and solid tumors. There are two important advantages of DBP over conventional measures of cytotoxicity. First, DBP can be applied much more efficiently to primary patient samples. Experiments measuring cytotoxicity in cancer cells often require days of culture. Because the long-term culture of primary patient samples is so unreliable, cytotoxic measurements in primary tumors are unreliable. DBP requires no more than a day of ex vivo culture since we measure well before frank cell death occurs, and we have demonstrated its predictive power in primary liquid and solid tumors. Second, there are many useful anti-cancer agents that do not cause frank cell death, but which nonetheless provoke apoptotic signaling that facilitates killing in combination regimens. Classical cytotoxic measurements do not identify these, but DBP does. We propose to study intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity based on differential response to compounds that sensitize mitochondria for apoptosis. We will focus on colon cancer tumors, as we have access to primary and PDX specimens of these tumors. Our main goals are to develop a therapeutic toolbox of potentially useful drugs, determine how best to combine these in a personalized way, and also to understand the molecular basis of the heterogeneity of mitochondrial function that underlies differences in response to these drugs.

MIND involves injection of epithelial cells derived from patient DCIS into the mammary ducts of immunocompromised mice. DCIS MIND xenografts exhibited the full spectrum of human DCIS including invasive progression. Histology of xenografted DCIS lesions that progressed to invasion showed disruption of basement membrane and myoepithelial layer by the invasive cells, retraction of myoepithelial layer and microinvasion. Therefore, the DCIS MIND model is a valuable tool for studying the early molecular mechanisms underlying DCIS invasive progression in a manner that is individualized to each patient DCIS. This proposal that is aimed at further improving the translation application of MIND models by mimicking the natural microenvironment of human DCIS in mice, is directly responsive to this FOA. The following specific aims (SA) are proposed: SA 1) Humanize mouse mammary fat pads with patient derived immortalized fibroblasts and study effects on DCIS progression to invasion, pathology and biomarker expression. The DCIS xenografts ± humanized fat pads will be assessed for pathology, biomarker expression and progression to invasion. We expect the xenografted DCIS with humanized mammary fat pads to more closely resemble patient DCIS with respect to pathology and biomarker expression. We also expect the humanized fat pads to enhance DCIS invasive progression in a fraction of DCIS MIND xenografts. Additionally, we will correlate DCIS epithelial cell inherent molecular aberrations (gene expression and/or genomic aberrations) to DCIS invasive behavior in the DCIS MIND xenografts. SA 2) Reconstitute the mouse hematopoietic system with patient derived immune cells and study effects on DCIS progression to invasion, pathology and biomarker expression. The experimental procedure involves reconstitution of mouse hematopoietic system with patient derived immune cells. We will utilize MISTRG mice, which are highly permissive for human hematopoiesis including support of the development and function of monocytes, macrophages and NK cells. DCIS xenografts ± patient derived immune system will be assessed for human immune cell infiltration to DCIS, DCIS pathology and invasive behavior as described in SA 1. We will correlate the recruitment of specific immune cells to DCIS as well as DCIS epithelial cell inherent molecular aberrations (gene expression and/or genomic aberrations) to DCIS invasive behavior in the MIND xenografts.

Obesity associates with increased risk and worse prognosis of many malignancies including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Obesity induces a pro-inflammatory state both locally in adipose tissue and systemically in visceral organs such as the pancreas. PDAC is a highly desmoplastic/fibrotic tumor in which angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) signaling activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), contributing to solid stress (the mechanical force exerted by the solid components of the tumor). We have recently shown that obesity- induced inflammation worsens the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME), and compromises perfusion, oxygenation and chemotherapy in PDACs (Cancer Discovery 2016). Our preliminary data suggest that obesity increases tumor stiffness and solid stress, which compress blood vessels and hinder the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic therapy. The desmoplastic reaction also promotes pro-survival signaling in cancer cells. We also found crosstalk between fibrotic (AT1) and inflammatory (interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) signaling pathways in PDACs in obese mice. These abnormalities also promote immunosuppression. Building on these exciting findings, we will further dissect molecular and mechanical mechanisms and develop novel strategies to overcome these obesity-induced biomechanical barriers to successful therapy in PDACs. We hypothesize that targeting AT1 and/or IL-1β will alleviate obesity-induced desmoplasia and reprogram the immune TME. To this end, we will study spontaneous and orthotopic PDAC mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) in both primary and liver metastasis settings. These PDAC models have successfully recapitulated clinical disease. We will characterize mechanical properties of PDACs in DIO using a newly developed approach together with the assessment of biochemical and cellular microenvironment. We will assess the effect of novel TME-activated AT1 blockers (TMA-ARBs), which allow delivery of high-dose ARBs to tumors while avoiding systemic hypotension We will also study the FDA approved IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) on obesity-altered PDAC biomechanics, and on inflammatory cytokines and cells in obesity (Aim 1). We will evaluate if TMA-ARBs/ IL-1Ra can reprogram immune TME in PDACs with obesity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how elevated solid stress and stiffness alter tumor cells and host stromal cells using in vitro engineered microenvironments with the results being tested in vivo (Aim 3). We anticipate that TMA-ARBs and/or IL-1Ra will alleviate desmoplasia and inflammation in PDACs in obese mice, reprogram ECM and immune TME and facilitate both conventional chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blocker immunotherapy. If successful, these studies will lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for obese PDAC patients. These novel treatments can be rapidly translated into the clinic based on our track record of successful clinical translation in collaboration with outstanding clinicians.

project	5R01CA210259-02	R01CA210259	9528373	2018	Using Technology to Scale-Up an Occupational Sun Protection Policy Program	Grant	A key goal in the Affordable Care Act is building a national culture of prevention through workplace health and safety initiatives. To achieve this goal, methods for scaling up evidence-based programs from research to wide- scale dissemination are needed to help balance effectiveness and cost. In many cases, there are pressures to reduce scale-up costs but at the expense of lower program implementation and effectiveness. A scale-up method that sacrifices effectiveness but reduces costs and reaches a larger number of employers may be acceptable. We will model the effectiveness and cost trade-off, along with the extent and representativeness of reach, when scaling up our evidence-based occupational sun protection intervention, Sun Safe Workplaces (SSW), for national distribution. The intervention, which relies on personal contact with managers and in- person employee training (SSW-IP), created large improvements in comprehensive workplace sun safety (i.e., policy adoption and employee education) in a randomized controlled trial. We will compare the existing in- person program delivery methods (SSW-IP) to a lower-cost dissemination method that utilizes Internet technology (SSW-T), i.e., virtual meetings, social networking, online training, and program materials. The aims of the research are to: 1) estimate the program reach (number and representativeness) and implementation rates (i.e., adoption of policies and delivery of education on occupational sun protection) achieved by the SSW- IP and SSW-T in a model of national distribution to public safety and public works industries; 2) estimate the costs associated with the SSW-IP and SSW-T (i.e., intervention costs and induced employer costs) and compare the estimated program benefits (i.e., policy and education) to cost; and 3) estimate the effect and cost- effectiveness of SSW-IP and SSW-T in secondary outcomes of a) changes in workplace environments and procedures for sun safety and b) workers’ sun safety practices. In a 5-year project, SSW-T will be created by redesigning our very effective SSW-IP methods to use the latest web conferencing, social networking, and online training technology for dissemination. The implementation rates (defined as policy adoption and education delivery) and costs associated with SSW-IP (n=50 employers) and SSW-T (n=150 employers) will be modeled in a randomized two-group pretest-posttest design, enrolling a national sample of 200 employers (i.e., firefighting departments and state departments of transportation). Unlike traditional randomized trials, the primary analysis will be of cost effectiveness to test the hypothesis that SSW-T can be delivered cost-effectively to an expanded group of worksites producing a lower implementation rate than SSW-IP but at substantially lower cost.

To achieve this goal, methods for scaling up evidence-based programs from research to wide- scale dissemination are needed to help balance effectiveness and cost. In many cases, there are pressures to reduce scale-up costs but at the expense of lower program implementation and effectiveness. A scale-up method that sacrifices effectiveness but reduces costs and reaches a larger number of employers may be acceptable. We will model the effectiveness and cost trade-off, along with the extent and representativeness of reach, when scaling up our evidence-based occupational sun protection intervention, Sun Safe Workplaces (SSW), for national distribution. The intervention, which relies on personal contact with managers and in- person employee training (SSW-IP), created large improvements in comprehensive workplace sun safety (i.e., policy adoption and employee education) in a randomized controlled trial. We will compare the existing in- person program delivery methods (SSW-IP) to a lower-cost dissemination method that utilizes Internet technology (SSW-T), i.e., virtual meetings, social networking, online training, and program materials. The aims of the research are to: 1) estimate the program reach (number and representativeness) and implementation rates (i.e., adoption of policies and delivery of education on occupational sun protection) achieved by the SSW- IP and SSW-T in a model of national distribution to public safety and public works industries; 2) estimate the costs associated with the SSW-IP and SSW-T (i.e., intervention costs and induced employer costs) and compare the estimated program benefits (i.e., policy and education) to cost; and 3) estimate the effect and cost- effectiveness of SSW-IP and SSW-T in secondary outcomes of a) changes in workplace environments and procedures for sun safety and b) workers’ sun safety practices. In a 5-year project, SSW-T will be created by redesigning our very effective SSW-IP methods to use the latest web conferencing, social networking, and online training technology for dissemination. The implementation rates (defined as policy adoption and education delivery) and costs associated with SSW-IP (n=50 employers) and SSW-T (n=150 employers) will be modeled in a randomized two-group pretest-posttest design, enrolling a national sample of 200 employers (i.e., firefighting departments and state departments of transportation). Unlike traditional randomized trials, the primary analysis will be of cost effectiveness to test the hypothesis that SSW-T can be delivered cost-effectively to an expanded group of worksites producing a lower implementation rate than SSW-IP but at substantially lower cost. Secondary analyses will compare the two scale-up strategies on implementation rate, differences in rate by employer groups (e.g., size and region), changes to workplace environment/procedures, and employee sun safety practices. The findings will have high impact by helping public health practitioners select the best strategy for scaling up evidence-based workplace health and safety programs to achieve this ACA goal.

Paradoxically, although estrogens stimulate breast cancers, risk rises markedly after menopause, when estrogens decrease. After menopause, estradiol falls and estrone is produced largely in fat by aromatase. Obesity women have high estrone, and both obesity and high estrone, but not estradiol, increase ER+ breast cancer risk after menopause. Low intra-tumor levels of enzymes converting estrone into estradiol, and elevation of enzymes that produce estrone both confer worse ER+ breast cancer outcome.  Obesity mediates chronic inflammation through NF-κB driven cytokine expression. We showed contact between invading breast cancer cells and obese adipose tissue induces pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cell types that stimulate cancer stem cells (CSC) and drive metastasis. Our data suggest that cytokine induction after breast fat:cancer cell contact is estrogen:ER dependent, since blocking estrogen synthesis with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, reduced cytokine induction upon co-culture. While estradiol is known to oppose NF-κB mediated inflammation, the role of estrone in inflammation is not known and may differ from that of estradiol. We will study how estrone and estradiol, and changes in the ratios thereof before and after- menopause, may influence NF-κB activity and the pro-inflammatory state in obese postmenopausal women.  We hypothesize that increased estrone:estradiol ratio after menopause shifts ER from an NF-κB co- repressor to a co-activator to up-regulate cytokines in obese adipocytes and cancer cells that drive CSC expansion and metastasis. We also posit that enzymes that convert estradiol to estrone may contribute to the poor outcome of ER+ cancers in obesity. Aim 1 will test if estradiol:ER decreases, estrone:ER increases or different estradiol:estrone ratios alter ER effects on NF-κB mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene drivers of CSCs in ER+ breast cancer cells. To test in Aim 2 if estrone cooperates with obesity to drive ER+ breast cancer initiation and growth, we will co-culture human ER+ breast cancer cells with mammary adipocytes from women with different body mass index (BMI) +/- aromatase inhibition and test consequences on cytokine levels and CSC. We will also implant syngeneic breast cancers into lean or obese wild-type or aromatase knock-out mice to elucidate if host estrone mediates tumor promoting effects of obesity. Aim 3 will test if overexpression of HSD17B14, that converts estradiol to estrone, increases ER+ breast cancer cytokine expression and CSC in vitro, and increases tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo. We will also compare levels of estradiol/estrone interconversion enzymes in breast adipocytes and cancers from lean, overweight and obese women. A better understanding of the roles of estradiol and estrone may lead to new strategies for breast cancer prevention and treatment, and to changes in hormone replacement therapies. Shifting toward a higher estradiol: estrone ratio in serum or in breast cancer cells may prove to have therapeutic potential.

Aim 3 will test if overexpression of HSD17B14, that converts estradiol to estrone, increases ER+ breast cancer cytokine expression and CSC in vitro, and increases tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo. We will also compare levels of estradiol/estrone interconversion enzymes in breast adipocytes and cancers from lean, overweight and obese women. A better understanding of the roles of estradiol and estrone may lead to new strategies for breast cancer prevention and treatment, and to changes in hormone replacement therapies. Shifting toward a higher estradiol: estrone ratio in serum or in breast cancer cells may prove to have therapeutic potential.

Although surgery is effective in early stage cancers, the median survival of women with advanced endometrial cancer is less than one year, and in the past 30 years there have been no major improvements in the treatment of advanced disease.  Neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy significantly increases long‐term survival, and there are no therapies (targeted or conventional) effective against metastatic disease.  Endometrial cancer research has lagged behind other cancers in grant allocation and progress relative to its clinical impact.  More recently, systematic genome‐wide sequencing efforts, such as the National Cancer Institute’s The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have brought the endometrial cancer genetic landscape into much clearer focus.  These studies have yielded many previously unsuspected endometrial cancer tumor suppressor genes (such as FBXW7) altered in a large percentage of cases, and thus of obvious clinical and research significance.  Cancers are complex amalgamations of various cell types that interact in myriad ways not only with one another, but also with the host organism.  Hence, many features of cancer cannot be modelled in vitro.  Consequently, in vivo genetic animal models are needed to further our understanding of these newly‐discovered genetic driver events in endometrial cancer.  Genetically‐engineered mouse models of endometrial cancer have lagged considerably relative to other types of cancer, and such models remain to be generated for most of the frequent endometrial cancer driver events.  One significant limitation has been the lack of fully optimized in vivo genetic models and the genetic tools to generate such models.  We propose to build upon prior efforts and employ a general, validated strategy to build a suite of genetic tools useful for the generation and characterization of diverse mouse models of invasive and lethal endometrial cancer.  The wide availability of this fully‐credentialed suite of genetic tools will bring new investigators into the field and greatly catalyze the development and use of clinically‐relevant mouse models of endometrial cancer.  These models and the diverse array of translational investigations they will foster will lead to new insights into the biology of these endometrial cancer driver genes and also aid in the identification of potential Achilles’ heels that can be exploited for treatment.    	Ablation;Age;Alleles;Animal Cancer Model;Animal Genetics;Animal Model;Biological;Biological Models;Biology;Cancer Model;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Research;Complex;Credentialing;Development;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Endometrial;Endometrial Carcinoma;Endometrial Neoplasms;Epithelial Cells;Epithelium;Estrogens;Event;FBXW7 gene;Female;Fostering;Future;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Recombination;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Human;Imagery;Incidence;Investigation;Lead;Life;Luciferases;Maintenance;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Modeling;Monitor;Mosaicism;Mouse Strains;Mutate;Mutation;National Cancer Institute;Neoplasm Metastasis;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organism;PTEN gene;Pattern;Penetrance;Performance;Proteins;Proteomics;Radiation therapy;Reporter;Research Personnel;Specificity;Testing;Tetanus Helper Peptide;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Tissues;Translational Research;Tumor Promotion;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Ubiquitination;Uterus;Variant;Woman;advanced disease;anticancer research;base;cancer genetics;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell type;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;combinatorial;exome sequencing;flexibility;genome-wide;improved;in vitro Model;in vivo;in vivo Model;in vivo imaging;insight;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;oncogene addiction;pre-clinical;prevent;prognostic;reproductive tract;response;targeted treatment;theranostics;tool;translational cancer research;translational model;translational study;tumor;ubiquitin-protein ligase	UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER	DALLAS	TX	UNITED STATES	DIEGO H CASTRILLON	DCB	Neeraja  Sathyamoorthy	570932	$500k to $749k	570932	12-Feb-2018	3-Mar-2017	28-Feb-2020	PAR-16-059	Moonshot

People with Lynch syndrome are also at increased risk for endometrial, ovarian, gastric, small bowel, and renal cancers. Importantly, well-established clinical guidelines with strong evidence exist for cancer treatment, screening, and prevention in individuals with LS. Identification of individuals with LS is accomplished through a variety of techniques, including family and medical history evaluation, computational models, or tumor testing. The systematic screening of all colorectal tumors for LS was first recommended by the Evaluation of Genetic Application in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) working group in 2009 and has been designated high priority by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine working group and by the Blue Ribbon Panel. The potential public health impact to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality of this intervention supports this priority, as effective implementation of LS screening will help meet the goals of the Cancer Moonshot as well as demonstrate the promise of precision medicine. Currently, implementation of LS screening in healthcare systems remains suboptimal for a variety of reasons. LS screening involves the coordination of multiple departments and individuals across an organization, which is often difficult in large, complex, healthcare systems. Therefore, the overarching goal of this project is to utilize tools from implementation science to describe, explain, and compare decision making and other variations in LS screening implementation across multiple healthcare systems to create and evaluate in a real world setting an organizational toolkit to facilitate implementation of LS screening. Our specific aims are to (1) Describe variation in LS screening implementation across multiple healthcare systems; then (2) Explain practice variation and determine factors associated with optimal implementation; and (3) Determine the relative effectiveness, efficiency, and costs of different LS screening protocols by healthcare system; and finally to (4) Develop and test in a natural environment an organizational toolkit for LS screening. This toolkit will enable effective implementation of LS screening programs; ultimately preventing needless suffering of patients and their family members from preventable cancers, decreasing waste in healthcare system costs, and informing strategies to facilitate the promise of precision medicine.

Mice can also be genetically engineered to study specific oncogenic pathways. Given the many positives associated with murine models, the vast majority of pre-clinical anti-cancer therapeutic studies are performed in a mouse. Unfortunately, the vast majority of oncology drugs (~94%) that are effective in murine tumor studies will ultimately fail when tested in humans. These failures cost billions of dollars and waste physician and patient resources. Clearly, current preclinical mouse tumor models are not accurately predicting a patients’ response to therapy. Thus current mouse models need to be improved to more accurately reflect human disease. Each of the currently available mouse models of human cancer has distinct strengths, but also critical flaws. One critical flaw in all available preclinical models is the lack of human tumor stroma. However, work from our group and others demonstrates that human tumor stroma is a critical component of the human tumor microenvironment which promotes human tumor growth, metastasis, suppresses anti-tumor immunity, and induces therapeutic resistance. Our long term goal is to develop a human tumor model that will, by better representing human tumors, will better cancer therapeutic response seen in human clinical trials. We hypothesize that a human tumor model with both human cancer cells and human tumor stroma will better represent primary human disease. As such, it will be a better/more stringent model for preclinical drug screening that could ultimately prevent a drug which is destined to fail from being used in clinical trials. We further hypothesize that human tumor stroma will better maintain tumor cell heterogeneity over time to more accurately reflect the natural evolution of therapeutic resistance. Finally such a model will be ideal for evaluating the impact of human tumor stroma on novel immune cell therapies. We propose to use a combination of human adult stem cells and cancer associated stem cells to create human tumor model with both human cancer cells and stromal cells. We will perform extensive histological and molecular profiling to confirm this model reflects primary tumor. Finally, we will (i) evaluate the models ability to predict patient response to disease in a retrospective study and (ii) assess the use of this model to evaluate novel immunotherapies using a novel CAR T-cell construct targeting ovarian cancer cells.

Pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasias (PanINs) represent an early, localized developmental stage of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), when curative surgical resection remains feasible. Understanding features of PDA precursor lesions like PanINs could generate new strategies for early PDA diagnosis and intervention. We have created a novel system for genetic modification and growth of primary human pancreatic cells to reconstitute the development of lesions with molecular and pathological features of human PanINs. Upon orthotopic transplantation these immortalized clones produce stable human induced pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasias (hiPanINs). Moreover, these PanIN lesions appear to be stable: after 6 months, they do not invade locally or metastasize. Here we propose to validate and optimize this new system for generating stable human PanIN-like lesions to enhance its uses for addressing unmet translational needs. In Aim 1 we propose to generate new hiPanIN clones whose mutational spectrum matches that found in native PanIN and PDA development. We will also assess prioritized biomarkers identified in the hiPanIN system in native human PanIN and PDA specimens. In Aim 2 we propose collaborative studies to test whether pancreatitis, further genetic modification, or extrinsic signals relevant to PDA can promote invasive or metastatic PDA in the hiPanIN orthotopic transplantation model. In summary our proposal is highly responsive to the FOA (PAR 16-059). We have created a “novel model to fill critical gaps in translational requirements” using “human and mammalian oncology models and their genetics”, and proposed studies to “ensure their appropriateness for addressing unmet translational needs.”	3-Dimensional;Address;Archives;Basic Science;Biological Markers;Biological Models;CDKN2A gene;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cell Line;Cells;Characteristics;Chemoprevention;Clinical;Clone Cells;Desmoplastic;Development;Diagnosis;Ductal Epithelial Cell;Ensure;Epithelial;Excision;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Growth;Human;Immunohistochemistry;Induced Mutation;Intervention;KRAS2 gene;Lesion;MADH4 gene;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pancreas;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia;Pancreatic duct;Pancreatitis;Pathologic;Prevention;Protein Analysis;Reporting;Research Personnel;Response Latencies;Signal Transduction;Specimen;System;TP53 gene;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Therapeutic Studies;Translational Research;Transplantation;Validation;actionable mutation;anticancer research;base;biomarker discovery;candidate marker;developmental genetics;diagnostic biomarker;effective therapy;human model;molecular marker;novel;oncology;pre-clinical;preclinical development;preclinical study;reconstitution;response;transcriptome sequencing;translational model;translational study	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	STANFORD	CA	UNITED STATES	Seung K Kim	DCB	GRACE S.

This caveat is particularly relevant for melanoma, given the pivotal role the immune system plays in its development. To address these limitations, we plan to study melanoma biology and therapy in a humanized mouse (HM) model. We initially developed a mis-matched HM (mHM; tumor and hematopoietic stem cells [HSCs] from different sources), and now have generated an autologous HM (aHM; tumor, HSCs and mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] from the same patient). In HM bearing tumors the human immune and mesenchymal cells from the patient's bone marrow homed into the growing tumor, migrated into the pre- existing mouse stroma, and interacted with the human cancer cells. Tumors grown in HM more closely resembled the originator tumor than those grown in non-HM mice, and the drift in gene expression caused by prior passaging was partially reversed. Signaling in key immune and stroma pathways was more prominent and closely resembled the originator patient in HM vs. non-HM models. The immune cells mounted effective tumor-specific immune responses, mediated by human immune cells including T cells. Significantly, immune responses upon immune therapies in the HM melanoma models showed a correlation with the patient's therapy results. Two salient and under-studied issues limit the wider application of HM: The relevance of the degree of tumor and immune matching, which can affect the faithfulness of immune response, and that can only be appreciated by comparing mHM and aHM. A second criticism to HM is xenogenic education of human T cells on mouse thymic cells, resulting from the lack of a functional human thymus in such models. In this application we will further address the relevance of an autologous versus mis-matched HM to test which approach gives rise to a more representative model of melanoma; secondly, using the same precursor cells from the patient we will reconstitute a functional thymus. The overarching goal of this proposal is to conduct a co-clinical trial where we will accomplish the following: 1) prospectively generate and characterize aHM and mHM from 20 melanoma patients, 2) test which approach yields a more representative melanoma HM model, 3) test in HM the immune drugs (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA4] and programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1] inhibitors) that each patient received and correlate with the clinical data, 4) identify the mechanisms involved in resistance to CTLA4/PD-1 inhibitors; and finally as an exploratory Aim in selected cases, we will 5) generate thymic epithelium from the same patient's HSCs that will result in HM with a fully autologous melanoma, thymus and immune system, thus enabling immune cell education in a strictly human context. This project will advance our understanding of the tumor-host interaction in melanoma and human cancer, by better characterizing the interplay between melanoma cells and the immune and stroma systems, leading to the discovery of new approaches to improve personalization of therapy and improve outcomes.

project	5R01CA214530-02	R01CA214530	9443610	2018	Mis-Implementation in Cancer Prevention and Control	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Through application of existing knowledge, much of the cancer burden is preventable. State- level practitioners are in ideal positions to affect programs and policies related to cancer control. Mis- implementation refers to ending effective programs and policies or continuing ineffective ones. Greater attention to mis-implementation should lead to use of effective interventions and more efficient expenditure of resources, which in the long term, will lead to positive cancer outcomes. GOAL: This proposal seeks to describe the extent of cancer control mis-implementation and to identify leverage points for addressing mis-implementation in the United States. AIMS AND METHODS: This is a three-phase study that takes a comprehensive approach, leading to the elucidation of tactics for addressing mis-implementation. Phase 1: The first aim seeks to assess the extent to which mis-implementation is occurring among state cancer control programs in public health. This initial phase will involve a survey of 800 practitioners representing all states. The programs represented will span the full continuum of cancer control (from prevention to survivorship). Phase 2: Using data from Phase 1 to identify organizations in which mis-implementation is high or low, we will conduct eight comparative case studies to understand contextual differences. These case studies will highlight lessons learned about mis-implementation and identify hypothesized drivers. Phase 3: The 3rd aim seeks to build agent-based models to identify dynamic interactions between individual, organizational, and contextual (external) factors driving mis-implementation. Agent-based modeling will be used to determine the most effective potential approaches for reducing mis- implementation. We will translate and disseminate findings from Phases 1-3 to practitioners and practice- related stakeholders in order to support the reduction of mis-implementation. All study phases will rely on an Advisory Group of public health practitioners and close collaboration with key practice partners. INNOVATIONS AND IMPACT: This study is innovative and impactful because it will: 1) be the first to refine and further develop reliable and valid measures of mis-implementation of public health programs; 2) bring together a strong, transdisciplinary team with significant expertise in practice-based research; 3) use agent- based modeling to address cancer control implementation; and 4) use a participatory, evidence-based, stakeholder-driven approach that will identify key leverage points for addressing mis-implementation among state public health programs. This research is expected to result in a replicable model that can significantly impact mis-implementation in cancer control and can be applied to other health areas.

By enabling significant increases in the reconstructed image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), TOF-PET has demonstrated substantial clinical impact on the visualization and quantification of molecular signatures of cancer in patients. In particular it has been shown to improve image quality and accuracy in count starved and contrast limited lesion detection scenarios. The effective photon sensitivity boost provided by TOF can also be exploited to significantly reduce injected dose to the patient and/or study duration, factors that would make PET more practical, cost-effective, and safe for a variety of clinical cancer imaging applications. Thus, studies that further advance the TOF-PET technique, and photon sensitivity in general, are highly worthwhile. The key to better TOF-PET performance is to improve the annihilation photon pair coincidence time resolution (CTR) measured between any two detection elements in the system, which has been a focus of research for the past two decades. Current commercially available PET systems achieve a CTR of roughly 350 to 800 ps full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). A goal of this proposal is to employ a novel scintillation detection configuration in order to achieve 100 ps FWHM CTR, without compromising other important performance parameters. This novel configuration also enables another capability not possible with the conventional PET detector: The ability to measure the energy and three-dimensional (3D) position of one or more annihilation photon interactions in the detector. Owing to the fact that most incoming 511 keV photons undergo inter-crystal Compton scatter in the detectors, we can exploit the kinematics of that process to estimate the photon angle-of-incidence. If successful, that capability enables us to accurately position the first interaction of such multi-crystal events, but also offers the potential to retain a high fraction of photon events that are normally rejected by a conventional PET system, such as single (unpaired) photons, random coincidences, tissue-scatter coincidences, and multiple (>2) photon coincidences. Since these normally-discarded events are over 10-fold more probable than true coincidence events in a standard PET study, this 3D position sensitive detector shows promise as another method to greatly boost photon sensitivity. If successful, this resulting substantial photon sensitivity increase, along with the substantial image SNR enhancement possible with 100 ps CTR would enable PET to be more sensitive, accurate, and practical for cancer imaging. In this project we will design and develop these next-generation detectors, integrate these modules into a prototype partial-ring PET system, and compare image quality and accuracy available with this partial-ring system to a state-of-the-art whole body TOF-PET system currently installed in our imaging clinic.

project	5R01CA215034-02	R01CA215034	9532808	2018	Comparative Effectiveness of Fecal Immunochemical Tests with Optical Colonoscopy	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the U.S., with nearly 50,000 deaths each year. Since CRC develops over a number of years from precursor lesions called polyps, it is largely detectable and preventable in early stages. As these polyps become larger, they, like most CRCs, tend to bleed, which is the rationale for the use of fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) to detect both polyps and cancers early, while they are curable. However, early screening and detection is much less common than it could be, with about 43% of eligible individuals unscreened. Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) are a type of FOBT that can be a sensitive, specific, and low- cost alternative to colonoscopy for CRC screening. Modeling studies have shown that for population screening, a strategy of annual FIT testing from age of 50 to 75 years results in an equal number of life-years gained as compared with colonoscopy every 10 years. However, about 90% of screening in the U.S. is done with colonoscopy, the most expensive and invasive screening test. FITs are far less costly and largely replacing the guaiac test in CRC screening programs internationally, where only individuals with positive results are referred for a colonoscopy. Studies done on FITs in other countries often used FITs not available in the U.S. or studied high-risk populations; thus, results are not applicable in the U.S. It is critical to determine the FIT(s) with the best test characteristics in order to implement successful FIT-based screening programs in this country. It is estimated that 24 million more individuals will need to be screened by 2018 to reach the “80% by 2018” goal set by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to compare the test characteristics of three CLIA-waived FITs and two automated FITs, using colonoscopy as the gold standard. The rationale for this proposed study is that, for almost all of the FITs currently marketed in the U.S., there is no evidence of the accuracy claimed. Our aims are:  Aim 1: To assess the diagnostic accuracy for advanced colorectal neoplasms of three of the most  commonly used CLIA-waived FITs and two automated FITs, using colonoscopy as the gold standard.  Aim 2: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two quantitative FITs using receiver operating characteristic  (ROC) analysis.  Aim 3: To assess factors associated with false positive and false negative FIT results for each device. These findings will provide essential information about FITs with the best test characteristics for future expanded use of FIT, critically important to achieving our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality from CRC. FITs are more acceptable to patients, will allow higher screening rates, and will reduce costs as compared with a screening strategy based on colonoscopy as the primary initial screening method.

Despite the known benefits of AETs, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. Furthermore, lower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality outcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more effective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and mortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have targeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a statistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web- enabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms will be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider communication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot trial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly reminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control group (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding the intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to develop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term effects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample powered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1) an “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a “Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET adherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning symptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable alerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long- term adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures, including AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will provide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the “Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience.

Although we have driven down population smoking rates, and with them, cancer rates, roughly 28% of the socioeconomically disadvantaged still smoke regularly. Low-income (L-I) smokers also develop cancer at higher rates and struggle more to quit than do higher-income smokers. These disparities in tobacco use and its burdens must be addressed. Highly effective cessation treatment services that can be delivered remotely, flexibly, and conveniently with few cost or logistical barriers have the potential to achieve this aim. Tobacco quitline and SmokefreeTXT services are such treatment resources with demonstrated attractiveness and reach among L-I smokers. The current proposal will use an efficient factorial design to evaluate 4 smoking cessation interventions with vast reach and dissemination potential. The target population will be N=1,408 Medicaid-eligible or uninsured smokers who have recently enrolled in the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL), but who report continued smoking 4- months following engagement in standard WTQL services. These treatment non-responders will be invited to participate in an experiment that will randomize them to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following 4 factors in a 2X2X2X2 design: WTQL counseling intensity (1 session vs. 4 sessions), medication intensity (2-week nicotine patch monotherapy vs. 4-week nicotine patch and lozenge combination therapy), a supportive text messaging program (SmokefreeTXT vs. none), and financial incentives (rewards of up to $150 for treatment engagement vs. no treatment incentives). The primary outcome will be 26-week biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence. Analyses will examine the main and interactive effects of these 4 treatment components on 26- week and secondary abstinence outcomes to identify the components and combinations of components that significantly enhance success in quitting in this high-risk population. This experiment will identify especially effective combinations of highly scalable interventions of modest cost and few barriers that could be disseminated nationally to reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking cessation among those seeking to quit. Additional analyses will: compare intervention components and promising component combinations in terms of cost-effectiveness, examine whether or not treatment engagement differs across component combinations, examine baseline variables that may moderate treatment response, and identify mediators of treatment effects on abstinence outcomes. Because delivery of the study interventions can be centralized through established and efficient services (WTQL and SmokefreeTXT), the potential for both scalable dissemination and cost-effectiveness of the interventions tested is great. The proposed research will help identify ways to reduce tobacco cessation disparities in L-I smokers who have tried to quit smoking but relapsed and may benefit from improved assistance.

Project summary/abstract PROJECT: Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women who have performed self-collection Cervical cancer is a serious public health problem reflecting social and gender inequalities in health. It is the third cause of cancer death among women in the world, with more than 85% of cases occurring in developing countries. Currently, the development of new technologies based on HPV DNA detection allows HPV self- collection, increasing screening coverage. In a self-collection based strategy, triage becomes a key step in the prevention process, as it is the first method to identify HPV+ women who will need diagnostic and treatment procedures. However, high adherence to triage is difficult to obtain, which is not surprising given that adherence to follow-up and treatment is a generalized problem in cervical cancer programs. Specific aims of the study are: 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests compared to usual care. 2. To evaluate the implementation strategy and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the multi-component mHealth intervention. The research study design will follow the structure of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial, and will use mix-method approach. A cluster randomized trial including 200 CHWs (clusters) and 4000 women will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to cytology triage at 120 days after positive HPV testing. The mHealth intervention will include SMS messages sent to HPV+ women to inform them when results are available, and subsequent SMS messages as reminders. In addition, for those HPV+ women who did not had a triage cytology result within 60 days of the HPV test result, CHWs will receive an e-mail and SMS message so they can contact these women during home visits for specific counseling and support. For the implementation evaluation, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to guide qualitative data collection and analysis of factors that influence implementation. RE-AIM will be used to assess the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance of the Intervention. Results of this project will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase triage of HPV+ women, but it could be adapted to increase compliance of diagnoses/ treatment of cervical cancer and other health problems. Findings from the implementation evaluation will be highly applicable to programs that use or are planning to incorporate HPV self-collection in different settings and countries. In addition, the use of CFIR and RE-AIM in this innovative study will serve as a model of work, constituting an important advance in the use of Implementation Science in the Region.

Project summary/abstract PROJECT: Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women who have performed self-collection Cervical cancer is a serious public health problem reflecting social and gender inequalities in health. It is the third cause of cancer death among women in the world, with more than 85% of cases occurring in developing countries. Currently, the development of new technologies based on HPV DNA detection allows HPV self- collection, increasing screening coverage. In a self-collection based strategy, triage becomes a key step in the prevention process, as it is the first method to identify HPV+ women who will need diagnostic and treatment procedures. However, high adherence to triage is difficult to obtain, which is not surprising given that adherence to follow-up and treatment is a generalized problem in cervical cancer programs. Specific aims of the study are: 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests compared to usual care. 2.

project	5R01CA221290-02	R01CA221290	9527109	2018	Metabolic reprogramming of Tregs in tumor immunity	Grant	Program Description/Abstract Metabolic reprogramming is a fundamental process underlying the growth of cancer cells and activated lymphocytes. These rapidly dividing cells markedly upregulate aerobic glycolysis (Warburg metabolism) and also reprogram mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to support the energy and growth demands. Moreover, mTOR signaling is a central regulator of anabolic metabolism in cancer cells and lymphocytes. While Warburg and mitochondrial metabolism and mTOR signaling are being actively studied, we are just beginning to appreciate the involvement of other biosynthetic programs such as de novo lipid synthesis (lipogenesis). Emerging evidence highlights that cancer immunotherapy is a powerful tool to combat cancers, but immune tolerance mediated by immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) represents a major obstacle for effective anti-tumor immunity. Although mTOR was generally considered a crucial negative regulator of Tregs, our genetic studies have revealed that mTORC1 is a pivotal positive determinant of Treg function by linking immune signals to the lipogenic program. In our preliminary studies, disruption of the lipogenic program in Tregs rendered the mice to reject tumor cells but did not cause obvious autoimmune disorders under steady state. We hypothesize that lipogenic program contributes to Treg suppressive activity in the tumor microenvironment, which could represent a novel target for cancer immunotherapy. We will test this hypothesis by establishing the roles of Treg lipogenic programs in tumor immunity, and determining the metabolic and signaling basis whereby lipogenesis programs Treg functions. We predict these studies will establish a new paradigm on our understanding of lipogenic program in Tregs and how this impinges upon tumor immunity. Insights gained from this project will likely lead to innovative strategies on cancer immunotherapy by capitalizing on metabolic reprogramming of Tregs.

project	5R01CA226776-02	R01CA226776	9658466	2019	Novel Uses of PI3K-inhibitors for the Treatment of advanced PIK3CA-mutant Breast Cancer	Grant	Summary. Our proposal addresses the problem of advanced, PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. We propose a role for PI3K-inhibitors in this disease at a stage when the disease no longer responds to endocrine manipulation, cdk4/6- or mTOR-inhibition and when patients typically receive palliative chemotherapy. These pre-treated tumors frequently display increased glucose avidity as evidenced by high SUVmax values in 18FDG- PET-scans and highly active glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect. 30 - 40% of breast tumors have activating PIK3CA mutations, and these co-occur with expression of estrogen receptor (ER). There are current clinical trial efforts aimed using modern PI3K-inhibitors (PI3Ki) GDC0032, Copanlisib or Gedatolisib to restore responsiveness to ER blockade, but studies to integrate these drugs at a later stage of PIK3CA-mutant BC are lacking. Here we propose a role for these more modern PI3K-inhibitors at later stages of the disease, when PIK3CA-mutant tumors have developed endocrine, cdk4/6i and mTORi resistance. We have recently discovered that PI3Ki work by disrupting an AKT-independent pathway that regulates glycolysis and sustains the Warburg effect, in addition to the disruption of canonical signaling pathways via AKT. In this pathway PI3K triggers the mobilization and release of aldolase from the cytoskeleton, and this in turn potentiates aldolase activity and the Warburg effect. This basic mechanism links PI3K signaling with cytoskeletal dynamics and enhanced glycolytic flux. To what extent PI3Ki efficacy is determined by the ability to inhibit aldolase and to suppress the Warburg effect in advanced cancer, is still unknown and will be examined here. We propose that the activating PIK3CA mutation fuels the carbohydrate metabolism of PIK3CA-mutant BC, even at the stage of endocrine resistance, hat the anti-metabolic activity of PI3K-inhibitors can be visualized using in vivo NMR and exploited to improve treatment outcomes in combination with anti- neoplastic agents. In the first aim we will introduce a mutant form of aldolase to determine the contribution of the PI3K-aldolase axis to PI3Ki-efficacy in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. In the second aim we will determine in vivo if the metabolic changes induced by PI3K-inhibition are predictive of cancer treatment responses. We will visualize lower glycolysis directly in tumors in vivo using NMR detection of 13C[1]-pyruvate metabolism and compare the predictive value of NMR with that of 18FDG-PET CT. Simultaneous studies of the flux of 13C-glucose and 13C[1]-pyruvate will be used to pinpoint mechanisms of resistance. In a third aim, we will develop treatment combinations that may improve the outcomes for women with metastatic BC. Given the vulnerability of BC cells in the early post-mitotic phase, we propose to explore PI3K-inhibition following infusion of taxanes or vinca alkaloids in mouse models of PIK3CA-mutant endocrine-resistant BC. Separately, we will explore if the concept of the PI3Ki/Parpi-combination that is currently in clinical trials in TNBC, can be promising in advanced PIK3CA-mutant BC.  	Address;Adopted;Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;Aldehyde-Lyases;Aldolase A;Antineoplastic Agents;Avidity;Binding;Breast Cancer Cell;Cell Line;Cell division;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Cytoskeleton;Data;Detection;Disease;Drops;Endocrine;Enzymes;Estrogen Receptor Status;Estrogen Receptors;Estrogen receptor positive;G2/M Arrest;Glucose;Glycolysis;Goals;In Vitro;Infusion procedures;Lead;Link;Mammary Neoplasms;Metabolic;Metastatic breast cancer;Mitotic;Modernization;Mutate;Mutation;PIK3CA gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pentosephosphate Pathway;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Positron-Emission Tomography;Predictive Value;Predictive Value of Tests;Protein Isoforms;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Pyruvate;Pyruvate Metabolism Pathway;Receptor Inhibition;Receptor Signaling;Refractory;Resistance;Role;Schedule;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Time;Translating;Treatment outcome;Vinca Alkaloids;Warburg Effect;Woman;Work;arm;cancer cell;cancer therapy;carbohydrate metabolism;chemotherapy;comparative;fluorodeoxyglucose;glucose metabolism;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;mTOR inhibition;malignant breast neoplasm;metabolic imaging;mouse model;mutant;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;nucleotide metabolism;palliative chemotherapy;predictive marker;receptor sensitivity;recruit;resistance mechanism;response;standard of care;taxane;treatment response;treatment strategy;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor metabolism	BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER	BOSTON	MA	UNITED STATES	GERBURG M WULF	DCTD	WEIWEI  Chen	388303	$250k to $499k	388303	13-Feb-2019	1-Mar-2018	28-Feb-2023	PA-16-160	Moonshot

project	5R01CA226776-05	R01CA226776	10336456	2022	Novel Uses of PI3K-inhibitors for the Treatment of advanced PIK3CA-mutant Breast Cancer	Grant	Summary. Our proposal addresses the problem of advanced, PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. We propose a role for PI3K-inhibitors in this disease at a stage when the disease no longer responds to endocrine manipulation, cdk4/6- or mTOR-inhibition and when patients typically receive palliative chemotherapy. These pre-treated tumors frequently display increased glucose avidity as evidenced by high SUVmax values in 18FDG- PET-scans and highly active glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect. 30 - 40% of breast tumors have activating PIK3CA mutations, and these co-occur with expression of estrogen receptor (ER). There are current clinical trial efforts aimed using modern PI3K-inhibitors (PI3Ki) GDC0032, Copanlisib or Gedatolisib to restore responsiveness to ER blockade, but studies to integrate these drugs at a later stage of PIK3CA-mutant BC are lacking. Here we propose a role for these more modern PI3K-inhibitors at later stages of the disease, when PIK3CA-mutant tumors have developed endocrine, cdk4/6i and mTORi resistance. We have recently discovered that PI3Ki work by disrupting an AKT-independent pathway that regulates glycolysis and sustains the Warburg effect, in addition to the disruption of canonical signaling pathways via AKT. In this pathway PI3K triggers the mobilization and release of aldolase from the cytoskeleton, and this in turn potentiates aldolase activity and the Warburg effect. This basic mechanism links PI3K signaling with cytoskeletal dynamics and enhanced glycolytic flux. To what extent PI3Ki efficacy is determined by the ability to inhibit aldolase and to suppress the Warburg effect in advanced cancer, is still unknown and will be examined here. We propose that the activating PIK3CA mutation fuels the carbohydrate metabolism of PIK3CA-mutant BC, even at the stage of endocrine resistance, hat the anti-metabolic activity of PI3K-inhibitors can be visualized using in vivo NMR and exploited to improve treatment outcomes in combination with anti- neoplastic agents. In the first aim we will introduce a mutant form of aldolase to determine the contribution of the PI3K-aldolase axis to PI3Ki-efficacy in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. In the second aim we will determine in vivo if the metabolic changes induced by PI3K-inhibition are predictive of cancer treatment responses. We will visualize lower glycolysis directly in tumors in vivo using NMR detection of 13C[1]-pyruvate metabolism and compare the predictive value of NMR with that of 18FDG-PET CT. Simultaneous studies of the flux of 13C-glucose and 13C[1]-pyruvate will be used to pinpoint mechanisms of resistance. In a third aim, we will develop treatment combinations that may improve the outcomes for women with metastatic BC. Given the vulnerability of BC cells in the early post-mitotic phase, we propose to explore PI3K-inhibition following infusion of taxanes or vinca alkaloids in mouse models of PIK3CA-mutant endocrine-resistant BC. Separately, we will explore if the concept of the PI3Ki/Parpi-combination that is currently in clinical trials in TNBC, can be promising in advanced PIK3CA-mutant BC.  	Address;Adopted;Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;Aldehyde-Lyases;Aldolase A;Antineoplastic Agents;Avidity;Binding;Breast Cancer Cell;Cell Line;Cell division;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Cytoskeleton;Data;Detection;Disease;Drops;Endocrine;Enzymes;Estrogen Receptor Status;Estrogen Receptors;Estrogen receptor positive;G2/M Arrest;Glucose;Glycolysis;Goals;In Vitro;Infusion procedures;Lead;Link;Mammary Neoplasms;Metabolic;Metastatic breast cancer;Mitotic;Modernization;Mutate;Mutation;PIK3CA gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pentosephosphate Pathway;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Positron-Emission Tomography;Predictive Value;Predictive Value of Tests;Protein Isoforms;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Pyruvate;Pyruvate Metabolism Pathway;Receptor Inhibition;Receptor Signaling;Refractory;Resistance;Role;Schedule;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Time;Translating;Treatment outcome;Vinca Alkaloids;Warburg Effect;Woman;Work;arm;cancer cell;cancer therapy;carbohydrate metabolism;chemotherapy;comparative;early phase clinical trial;fluorodeoxyglucose;glucose metabolism;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;inhibitor;mTOR inhibition;malignant breast neoplasm;metabolic imaging;mouse model;mutant;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;nucleotide metabolism;palliative chemotherapy;predict responsiveness;predictive marker;receptor sensitivity;recruit;resistance mechanism;response;standard of care;taxane;treatment response;treatment strategy;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor metabolism	BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER	BOSTON	MA	UNITED STATES	GERBURG M WULF	DCTD	WEIWEI  Chen	392306	$250k to $499k	392306	28-Jan-2022	1-Mar-2018	28-Feb-2023	PA-16-160	Moonshot

Over 3.3 million men are surviving with PCa in the United States and this number is expected to increase to 4.5 million by 2026. Current therapeutic strategies for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) include androgen receptor (AR) antagonists and a CYP17A1 inhibitor that prevents synthesis of androgens. Although these drugs extend the progression-free survival, approximately 30% of the tumors do not respond to these therapies and the remaining develops resistance shortly after treatment initiation. One of the primary reasons for CRPC relapse, despite these treatments, is expression of constitutively-active AR splice variants (AR-SV) that lack the ligand binding domain (LBD). To overcome this critical barrier, we discovered novel AR antagonists (Selective Androgen Receptor Degraders (SARDs)) that bind to the AR-activation function-1 domain (AF-1) in the N terminal domain (NTD) and/or LBD and antagonize and degrade AR and AR-SVs. The SARDs have unique pharmacologic properties that strongly and selectively antagonize the AR and degrade full length and splice variant AR (independent of LBD) in multiple models. These SARDs inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells and tumors that are dependent on AR full length and splice variants for growth. The SARDs we have tested thus far have poor bioavailability and drug-like properties. In order to overcome the poor bioavailability and to understand the mechanisms of action, we propose a) to develop novel SARDs that will inhibit and degrade full length and splice variants of the AR and will be orally bioavailable and b) to identify mechanisms by which the AR and its splice variants are degraded, resulting in drugs with better efficacy. Under aim-1 we will synthesize AR antagonists belonging to new generation of SARDs that will degrade the AR, inhibit prostate cancer growth, and will be orally bioavailable. We will synthesize and identify orally bioavailable SARDs and evaluate those using in vitro and in vivo PCa and CRPC models. These studies will result in highly potent new SARDs that will have drug-like properties. Under aim-2, we will identify the role of ubiquitination in AR and AR-SV degradation by discerning ubiquitin sites and characterizing their role in AR, AR-SV, and SARD action. Efforts will be dedicated in aim-3 to determine the scavenging role of SARDs and the implications of GATA-2 down-regulation for SARD function. The expected outcome of these studies will be new next generation drugs to treat aggressive CRPC, research tools to study AR degradation, better understanding of the AR and CRPC basic biology, and surrogate endpoints to advance these molecules to clinic.

Those who survive suffer lifelong consequences, largely due to complications from chemotherapy, and disease relapse is inevitable. Thus, there is an urgent need for new, improved treatments to eliminate AML cells rapidly and completely. Since AML is a highly heterogeneous disease caused by multiple mutations, we propose that a common, targetable feature among AML cases is that they are directly and indirectly influenced by cytokines secreted in the bone marrow microenvironment. Our long-term goal is to identify novel drug targets to selectively eradicate malignant clones that may impact the response to AML therapies. Our immediate goals are to comprehensively determine the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory pathways promote clonal evolution in AML. We found that the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is elevated in a diverse set of AML patients, both encourages AML cells to multiply and simultaneously impedes normal cell growth. Blocking communication between AML cells and IL-1 inhibits these effects and reduces survival of AML cells while sparing healthy progenitors. Because cells from a majority of AML patients with different genetic subtypes are dependent on IL-1 signaling for their survival, we predict that a large percentage of AML patients might benefit from drugs targeting this pathway. However, direct targeting of IL-1 signaling may impact cellular functions in healthy cells. We therefore focused our study on defining the IL-1-mediated molecular differences between AML and healthy progenitors. Gene expression analysis identified that IL-1 upregulates ASF1B and MARCKS in AML compared to healthy progenitors. ASF1B and MARCKS regulate cell proliferation, DNA damage response, and inflammation in AML. Our data shows that genetic and pharmacological targeting of ASF1B and MARCKS pathways suppresses AML growth. These findings suggest a number of important new research directions. In the proposed project, we will test the hypothesis that differential activation of ASF1B and MARCKS by IL-1β in AML versus healthy progenitors provides a competitive advantage to leukemic cells, which ultimately leads to AML progression. Specifically, we will determine: (1) the in vitro mechanisms by which IL-1 activation of ASF1B and MARCKS promotes the growth of AML cells; (2) the roles of ASF1B and MARCKS in conferring IL-1-mediated growth advantage and driving AML progression in vivo; and (3) the validity of ASF1B and MARCKS as therapeutic targets in AML using available small-molecule inhibitors. To achieve our goals we established a variety of tools including 4 new transgenic mouse models and access to TLK and MARCKS inhibitor through collaborations with world-renowned leaders. Determining the underlying molecular mechanisms by which IL-1 supports AML development will pave the way to designing new treatment strategies.

project	5R01CA231011-02	R01CA231011	9876982	2020	Development of Long non-coding RNA-directed Target Therapy for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer	Grant	Project Summary  As a deadly disease lacking an FDA-approved targeted therapy, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) involves a complicated and entangled network of oncogenic processes in which long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a novel class of regulatory RNA molecules, may play important roles. The proposed study will genetically exploit lncRNA-regulated cellular networks in TNBC to identify an improved therapeutic strategy. Our research has illuminated lncRNA involvement in TNBC metastasis and metabolic reprogramming. One lncRNA, LINK-A, is upregulated in TNBC and is negatively correlated with breast cancer patient outcomes. Tissue-specific expression of LINK-A in mouse mammary glands drives tumor development and lung metastasis, which shares morphological and transcriptional similarity to human TNBC. Furthermore, the expression of LINK- A facilities an immunosuppressive environment and profoundly impacts CD9+ T-cell infiltration via lncRNA- mediated antigenicity loss. Mechanistically, LINK-A concurrently activates multiple oncogenic signaling pathways and promotes TRIM71-dependent degradation of the peptide-loading complex, leading to impaired antigen presentation. Therefore, LINK-A transgenic mice should serve as a powerful tool for dissecting the molecular complexity of TNBC and assessing precise therapeutic formulations against TNBC. Since most pathway inhibitors in TNBC clinical trials have been unsuccessful, a lncRNA-directed therapeutic approach, with the appropriate combination of immunotherapy, may optimize the efficacy of therapies for TNBC. The long-term goal of the proposal is to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated antigenicity loss and immunosuppression so that improved strategies can be developed to reduce TNBC morbidity and mortality. Our central hypothesis is that LINK-A promotes the initiation and immunoresistance of breast cancer, which can be attenuated in vivo by a combinatorial treatment approach. We will address our hypothesis from following aspects: we will first define the underlying molecular mechanism of lncRNA-dependent antigenicity loss. We will then restore antigenicity by targeting lncRNA and lncRNA-related signaling events. Finally, we will ascertain the functional importance of lncRNAs in breast cancer tumorigenesis. Emerging evidence of the oncogenic involvement of lncRNAs, as well as their implicated roles in mediating immunosurveillance and immunosuppression, warrants further characterization of TNBC-specific lncRNAs and future applications that hinge on their activity. Our goal is to demonstrate that LINK-A, as a hallmark of TNBC, may serve as a diagnostic marker that predicts a cancer’s sensitivity to immunotherapy. Thus, a strategy that combines immune checkpoint blockers and lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies has the potential to significantly advance TNBC treatment. In the long run, these research findings will benefit the cancer community by introducing the robust clinical effects of targeting lncRNAs and a well-defined means of stratifying patients based on these oncogenic lncRNAs.

project	5R01CA241148-02	R01CA241148	10145618	2021	Targeting Aldehyde Dehydrogenase for Cancer Prevention	Grant	ABSTRACT: In cancer, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme activity is high in dendritic cells and regulatory T-cells, hypothesized to modulate the immune response and also in cancer stem cells (CSCs) to aid the development of recurrent resistant disease. It is therefore surprising that drugs targeting ALDH have not been developed to modulate these processes in cancer. To investigate this issue, we tested the efficacy of existing isoform-specific and broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitors on cultured cells and found that none were very effective at modulating cell survival. Furthermore, we predicted that a broad-spectrum inhibitor would be needed due to the overlapping functions of the ALDH family members. These observations provided the rationale to develop a non-toxic broad- spectrum ALDH inhibitor, which would kill ALDH+ CSCs to prevent recurrent resistant disease, and improve immunotherapy of melanoma. Thus, the central hypothesis is that a non-toxic ALDH inhibitor can be developed to reduce recurrent resistant disease development mediated by ALDH+ CSCs and improve the efficacy of existing immunotherapies by reducing immune suppression. Preliminary data show development of a potent non-toxic ALDH inhibitor built on the backbone of the Isatin natural product. This agent eliminates CSCs with high ALDH activity, preventing increases in ALDH+ cells typically seen with traditional drug treatments. Finally, the inhibitor improves the preclinical efficacy of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model where this approach alone is not effective. Based on these hypothesis-supporting preliminary data, the following Specific Aims are proposed. First, determine how effectively a non-toxic broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitor eliminates the melanoma ALDH+ CSC population that expands when treating with traditional chemotherapy. Furthermore, determine its potency when combined with traditional chemotherapy to prevent recurrent resistant disease development. This will be achieved by isolating ALDH+ and ALDH- cell populations from cell lines and patient derived (PDX) tumors and determining inhibitor efficacy for preventing recurrent resistant disease development when provided in combination with current clinically relevant chemotherapy. Finally, the mechanistic basis for inhibition of resistance by the agent combination will be identified. Second, determine the efficacy of a non-toxic broad-spectrum ALDH inhibitor on immune regulatory and effector cells in the tumor microenvironment, alone and when combined with anti-PD1 antibody immunotherapy. Specific targeting of ALDH in melanoma tumor cells and in host cells on therapeutic efficacy will be tested. Mechanisms leading to enhanced immune response will be identified by defining the impact of the inhibitor and antibody combinations on immune cell composition and function within the tumors, assessing the relative ALDH levels in the immune cell populations, and using transient and genetic approaches to target the modulating immune cells. These significant discoveries would demonstrate the efficacy of targeting ALDH enzymes in cancer for modulating resistance and immune cell function, providing needed preclinical validation necessary for clinical translation.

Here we will focus on the RB-tumor suppressor pathway as a central node controlling proliferation downstream of multiple pathways of relevance to therapy of ER+ breast cancer (e.g. endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors). While RB is required for the effective cytostatic response to a range of targeted therapies employed in ER+ breast cancer, multiple pathways can contribute to “cell cycle plasticity” and therefore represent distinct means for generating therapeutic resistance. Here we will delineate the processes underlying this form of resistance, means to elicit durable cell cycle arrest, and approaches to target resistance as observed clinically (Aim 1). Our data and newly published studies indicate that RB loss occurs in ER+ breast cancer as a means to escape from cytostatic therapies. Analysis of the RB locus in ER+ breast cancer indicates loss of one copy of 13q occurs in a significant fraction of ER+ breast cancers, suggesting that such tumors are primed for RB loss. How to subsequently treat tumors that are heterogeneous for RB or are solely RB deficient represents a significant challenge. Using drug screening and organoid approaches we have defined several regimens that are particularly effective against RB-negative tumors and could represent a general means to target ER+ tumors that progress on CDK4/6 inhibitors (Aim 2). Together these aims will interrogate means to further leverage the RB tumor suppressor for a precision approach to the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.	13q;Adjuvant Chemotherapy;Affect;Aromatase Inhibitors;Biological;Breast Cancer Model;Breast Cancer Patient;Breast Cancer Treatment;Bypass;CDK2 gene;CDK4 gene;Cell Cycle;Cell Cycle Arrest;Cell Cycle Deregulation;Cell Cycle Progression;Cell Cycle Regulation;Cell model;Cessation of life;Clinic;Clinical;Complex;Critical Pathways;Cytostatics;Data;Disease;Disease Progression;Drug Screening;Drug usage;Estrogen Antagonists;Estrogen Receptor Status;Estrogen Receptors;Estrogen Therapy;Estrogen receptor positive;Estrogens;Event;Evolution;Fulvestrant;Gene Dosage;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Targeting;Genetic;Goals;Hormonal;Intervention;Malignant Neoplasms;Metastatic breast cancer;Modeling;Molecular Target;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organoids;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Publishing;Recurrence;Regimen;Regulatory Pathway;Relapse;Resistance;Risk;Sampling;Seminal;Signal Pathway;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;United States;Woman;Work;base;de novo mutation;genetic evolution;genetic selection;hormone therapy;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant breast neoplasm;next generation;patient derived xenograft model;personalized approach;pressure;prognostic;programs;public health relevance;receptor function;response;targeted agent;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;treatment response;tumor;tumor heterogeneity	ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP	BUFFALO	NY	UNITED STATES	Erik  Knudsen,Agnieszka  Witkiewicz	DCTD	SHARAD KUMAR Verma	429531	$250k to $499k	429531	23-Feb-2021	1-Mar-2020	28-Feb-2025	PA-19-056	Moonshot

project	5R01CA248310-02	R01CA248310	10137900	2021	Development of a first-in-class mEGFR dimerization inhibitor	Grant	Background: Lung cancers are often driven by mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (mtEGFR). While EGFR tyrosine kinase activity inhibitors (TKI) have shown effectiveness, within 9-13 months all patients develop resistance including to 3rd generation TKI - Osimertinib. These patients do not have any approved therapy options, therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a novel agent that functions independently of kinase function. DGD1202, a first-in-class, novel, orally bioavailable, small molecule that inhibits EGFR dimerization, induces degradation of EGFR and selectively kills TKI resistant NSCLC tumors. Objective: We and others have shown that the degradation of mutant EGFR protein has a profound effect on cancer cell survival. Thus, we hypothesized that a drug which induces degradation of mtEGFR independent of the ATP binding domain will result in selective activity. Our objective is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of DGD1202 in a panel of lung cancer cells lines, xenografts, and PDXs derived from lung cancer patients containing mtEGFR who have undergone treatment with a TKI. Specific Aims: We propose to evaluate the specificity and potency of DGD1202 against TKI-resistant lung cancer cells and xenografts. Aim 1 is to determine the in vitro efficacy of DGD1202 against a panel of EGFR driven, including osimertinib-resistant, cancer cell lines relative to normal cells. Aim 2 is to conduct in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses to assess drug exposure and determine the effect on the target. Aim 3 is to determine the overall therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety of DGD1202 in vivo. We hypothesize that treatment with DGD1202 will induce EGFR degradation preferentially in tumor cells driven by mtEGFR and that EGFR degradation will correlate with the overall response. Study Design: We will screen DGD1202 alongside osimertinib in a series of lung cancer lines. The resulting response will be then correlated with effect on EGFR degradation. We also propose to determine in vivo PK and PD studies both with a single and with fractionated dosing to determine the optimum bioavailability. Using the optimized dose and schedule, we will assess effects on EGFR protein against a panel mtEGFR-driven and osimertinib resistant lung cancer xenograft and PDX models. The long-term safety will be assessed in immune competent mice. Standard statistical models will be used to compare the response to treatment and how it correlates with effects on EGFR. Impact: We anticipate that our approach will open a new way to target EGFR and, more broadly, to develop therapeutics to selectively target mutated proteins to degradation. The knowledge gained from in vivo tumor models will provide a rationale for the use of this class of molecules in future clinical studies.

The majority of these patients will enter into a prolonged post-treatment survivorship phase of care. However, we are currently facing unprecedented challenges in survivorship care delivery. Serious gaps in the care of survivors have been identified, including underuse of guideline-recommended cancer surveillance services, such as annual mammography for breast cancer survivors and colonoscopy for colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, and underuse of recommended preventive care services such as vaccinations, lipid testing and cardiovascular risk management, and disease screenings. Compounding these issues, our current oncology workforce is insufficient to care for the rapidly growing population of survivors. Primary care provider (PCP)-led survivorship care is a feasible model of survivorship care. In observational studies, survivors who receive care that involves PCPs received higher quality of care; international randomized trials comparing PCP-led to oncology-led survivorship care have shown no significant differences in time to detection of cancer recurrence or quality of life for early-stage survivors. However, there is a paucity of high-quality research on models of survivorship care in the U.S, particularly in community-based settings, seriously limiting our ability to provide high-quality cancer survivorship care. To address these issues, we will conduct a prospective cluster randomized trial of two models of cancer survivorship care in early-stage, low- risk breast cancer and CRC survivors cared for in a community-based, integrated health care setting. Building on our pilot work and drawing on the empirical literature, we will test the efficacy of an embedded PCP model (experimental condition) in which PCPs are embedded within an oncology practice and will care for low-risk survivors who will be transitioned at 12 months post-treatment. These PCPs will be given training in cancer survivorship care focused on cancer surveillance and chronic disease prevention. This model will be compared to the extant oncology physician model (usual care) that is the default condition in this healthcare system. The primary outcome will be receipt of guideline-recommended care (e.g., cancer surveillance, preventive care), assessed over a 36-month period. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated measures of patient-provider communication, care coordination, quality of life, self-efficacy in managing care, and other measures. We will also compare utilization of unplanned care (hospitalizations, urgent care) and receipt of non-recommended care. We will explore PCP perceptions of confidence in delivery of survivorship care. We will conduct this trial in 8 large, hospital-based medical centers of an integrated health care system, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, with approximately 2,000 early-stage breast and CRC survivors. Our results will provide more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of a scalable model of PCP-led survivorship care, addressing the critical shortage of oncology providers while maintaining or improving quality.

Serious gaps in the care of survivors have been identified, including underuse of guideline-recommended cancer surveillance services, such as annual mammography for breast cancer survivors and colonoscopy for colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, and underuse of recommended preventive care services such as vaccinations, lipid testing and cardiovascular risk management, and disease screenings. Compounding these issues, our current oncology workforce is insufficient to care for the rapidly growing population of survivors. Primary care provider (PCP)-led survivorship care is a feasible model of survivorship care. In observational studies, survivors who receive care that involves PCPs received higher quality of care; international randomized trials comparing PCP-led to oncology-led survivorship care have shown no significant differences in time to detection of cancer recurrence or quality of life for early-stage survivors. However, there is a paucity of high-quality research on models of survivorship care in the U.S, particularly in community-based settings, seriously limiting our ability to provide high-quality cancer survivorship care. To address these issues, we will conduct a prospective cluster randomized trial of two models of cancer survivorship care in early-stage, low- risk breast cancer and CRC survivors cared for in a community-based, integrated health care setting. Building on our pilot work and drawing on the empirical literature, we will test the efficacy of an embedded PCP model (experimental condition) in which PCPs are embedded within an oncology practice and will care for low-risk survivors who will be transitioned at 12 months post-treatment. These PCPs will be given training in cancer survivorship care focused on cancer surveillance and chronic disease prevention. This model will be compared to the extant oncology physician model (usual care) that is the default condition in this healthcare system. The primary outcome will be receipt of guideline-recommended care (e.g., cancer surveillance, preventive care), assessed over a 36-month period. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated measures of patient-provider communication, care coordination, quality of life, self-efficacy in managing care, and other measures. We will also compare utilization of unplanned care (hospitalizations, urgent care) and receipt of non-recommended care. We will explore PCP perceptions of confidence in delivery of survivorship care. We will conduct this trial in 8 large, hospital-based medical centers of an integrated health care system, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, with approximately 2,000 early-stage breast and CRC survivors. Our results will provide more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of a scalable model of PCP-led survivorship care, addressing the critical shortage of oncology providers while maintaining or improving quality.

However, HCT-related factors, such as total body irradiation used for conditioning, graft-versus-host disease, and prolonged exposure to immunosuppressive therapy, result in very high risk for subsequent skin cancers. Compared with the general population, HCT survivors are also more likely to develop skin cancers at a younger age, have advanced disease at presentation, and experience multiple recurrences. Despite this high burden, less than 20% of long-term HCT survivors report being examined for skin cancer, even though >90% were seen by their primary care physician (PCPs) in the prior year. In HCT survivors, skin cancers develop at a time when their follow-up care has largely transitioned from oncology care to the primary care setting, emphasizing the need to develop innovative strategies that 1) provide HCT survivors with the skills to conduct effective skin self-examinations, and prompt action from their providers when worrisome lesions are found; 2) engage PCPs in HCT risk-based screening for skin cancer; and 3) ensure rapid access to dermatologic exams. Advances in technology, including widespread availability of cell phones and teledermoscopy (remote expert assessment of a photographed lesion) offer promising opportunities to improve early detection and treatment of skin cancer. We propose a comparative effectiveness study that will examine the impact of patient activation and education (PAE), alone or in combination with physician-tailored strategies, on clinically meaningful behavioral outcomes. We will enroll 720 HCT survivors at a large, diverse HCT center to: 1) Determine the impact of PAE alone or with physician activation (PAE+Phys) on skin cancer screening and prevention practices at 12 months; and 2) Among PCPs of HCT survivors, determine the impact of a teledermoscopy e-learning program compared with provision of print materials for identifying suspect lesions. We hypothesize that compared to PAE, patients randomized to PAE+Phys will report higher rates of thorough self- and provider skin exam, shorter time to referral of suspicious lesions, and improved quality of life; compared to print materials alone, physicians randomized to teledermoscopy e-learning will have greater recognition of suspect lesions and more appropriate, cost-effective referral patterns. Our multi-disciplinary team will: 1) establish the efficacy of PAE, and the relative benefit of physician activation; 2) inform the practice of skin cancer screening using innovative mobile strategies that are readily applicable in the clinical setting; and 3) identify facilitators of and barriers to appropriate delivery of survivorship-focused preventive care for long-term HCT survivors. Information obtained from the current study can be used to develop strategies for management of other late effects (e.g. cardiovascular, endocrine) in HCT survivors in the primary care setting, and to improve skin cancer screening in other high-risk (e.g. radiation-exposed) cancer survivor populations.

project	5R01CA249467-02	R01CA249467	10146986	2021	Optimizing Functional Outcomes of Older Survivors After Chemotherapy	Grant	Project Summary: The overarching goal of this proposal, submitted in response to RFA-CA-19-035, is to evaluate if an aging- sensitive survivorship intervention improves outcomes valued by older adults and their caregivers during the transition into survivorship from curative-intent chemotherapy. This proposal is important because by 2040, 73% of survivors will be aged 65+ and almost 50% will be aged 75+. Unfortunately, aging- related conditions (e.g., physical and cognitive function impairments) are not addressed routinely in survivorship care. Preliminary research by all multiple principal investigators (MPIs: Mohile, Janelsins, Mustian) suggests that a Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) intervention is effective for surveilling, triaging and managing physical and cognitive impairments, improving patient and caregiver satisfaction, and fostering communication about aging-related conditions during chemotherapy in older cancer patients and their caregivers. Preliminary research by MPIs also suggests that a Survivorship Health Promotion program is effective for improving physical function among older survivors after chemotherapy. Our MPI team has shown that GEM and Survivorship Health Promotion are feasible to implement in older patients, survivors and caregivers in nationwide samples recruited via the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base network. To fill existing empirical gaps in survivorship care for older survivors and caregivers, we created a novel intervention called Survivorship-GEM by combining these two very promising and synergistic programs. Survivorship-GEM is directed by oncology advanced practice providers (APPs), because they routinely direct care for survivors in the community. We propose to conduct a two-arm cluster randomized trial comparing the efficacy of our novel Survivorship-GEM intervention to usual care for improving physical and cognitive function, satisfaction with care, completion of referral appointments, and hospitalizations among older survivors. We will also examine the effect of Survivorship-GEM on oncology APP communication with primary care providers and on caregiver distress and satisfaction with care. We will randomize 30 NCORP community oncology practices to two arms: 1) Survivorship-GEM or 2) usual care. Survivors aged 65+ (n=720) and caregivers (if available, estimated n=500) will complete baseline assessments at the end of curative-intent chemotherapy for a solid tumor malignancy with follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Our uniquely qualified, multidisciplinary team includes expertise in geriatrics, clinical trials, nursing, primary care, behavioral oncology, rehabilitation, health disparities, biostatistics, and implementation science. The team also benefits from collaborations with the Cancer and Aging Research Group Advisory Board and the SCOREboard patient advocate group. The APP-directed Survivorship-GEM intervention is highly innovative and has tremendous potential to improve outcomes in older survivors and caregivers by surveilling, triaging and managing the effects of chemotherapy and by fostering health promotion.

This research is critical because lung and colorectal cancer survivors have high post-treatment needs, are older, and suffers from greater co-morbidities and poor quality of life (QOL). Lung and colorectal cancer survivors remain underrepresented in research, leading to significant disparities in post-treatment outcomes. Based on the Chronic Care Self-Management Model (CCM), the SSM Intervention includes the following components: 1) care coordination and communication between oncology and primary care on surveillance/follow-up, health promotion, disease prevention, and comorbidity management; 2) provision of clinician care plan to PCPs; 3) comprehensive patient/geriatric assessment for survivors of all ages; 4) personalized care plan for survivors; and 5) survivor self-management skills building for surveillance/follow-up, late and long-term effects of treatments, comorbidities, and healthy living. It is administered in five telehealth sessions (Zoom videoconferencing) and three subsequent maintenance telehealth sessions for survivors who are four months post-treatment. We will test the efficacy of the SSM Intervention using a randomized design of attention control arm versus an intervention arm to pursue the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (Primary): Determine the efficacy of the intervention on care coordination, communication, and provider knowledge at 4 months post-accrual; Specific Aim 2 (Primary): Determine the efficacy of the intervention on survivor outcomes at 4 months post-accrual; and Specific Aim 3 (Exploratory): Assess the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the intervention. The RE-AIM Framework informs intervention delivery process, which will set the stage for future large scale implementation for sustainability in real-world care settings. This proposal is innovative because it addresses a critical need to improve care delivery and outcomes for high needs, understudied survivorship populations (lung, colorectal, older survivors), and the telehealth approach promotes scalability. The interdisciplinary team, which includes expertise in nursing science (Sun, Reb, Ferrell), oncology (Fakih), and primary care (Kim) is uniquely suited to conduct this research. The proposal is significant, with high scientific rigor and outcomes that are of critical importance to survivors, clinicians, healthcare systems, the National Cancer Institute, and the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM. The research will address a critical gap in knowledge of how self-management interventions improve care delivery and outcomes during post-treatment transitions to follow-up care.

project	5R01CA249568-02	R01CA249568	10159878	2021	Onco-primary care networking to support TEAM-based care - the ONE TEAM Study	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Since the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released the seminal report, From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition 13 years ago, there has been substantial progress in understanding the health issues affecting cancer survivors, yet little has changed regarding survivorship care delivery. There remains a disconnect between primary care providers and oncology care teams that has led to persistent problems implementing risk-stratified survivorship care for cancer survivors. With advances in cancer therapy and improved survival rates, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) now exceeds that of the cancer for many survivors. While cancer therapy may contribute to this risk, it is generally a compilation of non-modifiable factors (i.e., genetics, aging), as well as modifiable lifestyle behaviors (i.e., diet, exercise) that lead to both the cancer and to cardiovascular disease (CVD). With the lack of primary care provider (PCP) integration in the cancer care team and time constraints and difficulty keeping up with rapidly evolving non-cancer therapeutics for medical oncologists, there is an inferred lower priority for comorbidity management. We will determine the effectiveness of the multi-level iGuide intervention and the up-titrated iGuide2 intervention compared with usual care on the primary outcomes. The theory-driven, self-guided iGuide intervention consists of patient-level components (video vignettes, patient-facing webinars) and PCP-level components (electronic health record [EHR] automated cancer specialist-PCP letter, tele-education series, and automated reminders). The up-titrated iGuide2 intervention consists of tailored patient-level video vignettes and targeted EHR specialist-PCP communication. The primary outcomes of the ONE TEAM SMART-design study are (1) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures of management of the three CVD comorbidities (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia) based upon laboratory and clinical measurement; (2) medication adherence assessed pharmacy refill data using Proportion of Days Covered (PDC); and (3) patient-provider communication (Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care). Secondary aims include exploring moderating and mediating factors in each level of the intervention, support of patient-centered outcomes, health care use, measures of provider activation, and costs of care resulting from the multi-level intervention. The overarching goal of this proposed project is to optimize the management and outcomes of individuals with cancer, both during and after treatment, and to develop a ‘low-touch’ multi-level intervention that can be generalized, adapted and scaled in other health care systems. The proposed ONE TEAM study brings together a multi-disciplinary research team with the necessary expertise and experience in survivorship research, population and behavioral science, primary care, oncology, and biostatistics. Results from this intervention will have important implications in the advancement of healthcare delivery for cancer survivors.

Such heterogeneity becomes a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment and personalized medicine. Because of this inherent heterogeneity, data collected from cancer cell population-averaged assays likely hides valuable but rare events such as dramatic variations in gene expression at the single cell level. Therefore, understanding cellular heterogeneity from cancer biospecimens, especially in the study of phenotype-genotype correlation, will facilitate identification of new cell subsets, and assist in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. In this proposal, we focus on developing a high throughput approach for single-cell isolation based on cells' capability in generating protrusions. To be able to retrieve the desired single adherent cell, a Protrusion Analysis Chip (PAC) is proposed, in which the single cell is captured by a single hook and physically isolated by a barrier. The PAC is rapid, operationally simple, highly efficient, and requires low-volume sample introduction. After adhesion and spreading, cell phenotype is identified microscopically and then the desired cell is retrieved for genotype analysis. The proposed technology developments and study plans may potentially strengthen the understanding of the relationship between phenotype and genotype at the single cell level.

project	5R21CA215968-02	R21CA215968	9527063	2018	Investigating developmental Hox programs as determinants of sarcomagenesis	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Hijacking of normal developmental programs is a common mechanism of tumorigenesis and deregulation of developmental HOX programs, in particular, contributes to the pathogenesis of leukemia, as well as some solid tumors. We recently discovered that HOX gene expression is highly deregulated in Ewing sarcoma, an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor that has a peak incidence in adolescence. Specifically, the posterior HOX genes, HOXD10, HOXD11 and HOXD13, are over-expressed compared to other normal and malignant tissues, and down-regulation of HOXD13 in Ewing sarcoma cell lines results in a dramatic decrease in tumorigenicity. The expression of all Hox genes normally becomes restricted to distinct regions of the developing musculoskeletal (MSK) system during embryonic development, with the posterior genes becoming restricted to the lumbosacral vertebrae, pelvis and developing forelimb and hindlimb – the dominant sites of Ewing sarcoma presentation clinically. Recent work from the Wellik laboratory has shown that Hox-expressing cells arise as mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells (MSCs) during embryonic development and persist as regionally-restricted MSCs through postnatal and adult stages. MSCs have been implicated as putative cells of origin for Ewing sarcoma, but the precise identity of the target cells, the molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation and a clear explanation of the region-specific etiology of this tumor type remain poorly understood. Important for this application, the Lawlor lab has shown that ectopic expression of the Ewing sarcoma driver oncogene, EWS/FLI1, in bulk populations of MSCs initiates tumorigenesis and disrupts HOX gene expression as a result of epigenetic deregulation. These two key findings lead us to the novel hypothesis that EWS/FLI1-dependent disruption of the posterior HOX program in MSCs where these genes are developmentally and regionally expressed (i.e. the posterior skeleton) is central to Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis. We will determine the efficiency and latency of EWS/FLI1-induced tumor formation in Hox-expressing MSCs that are isolated from different anatomic sites and test the hypothesis that oncogenic transformation occurs more readily in MSC populations where restricted, posterior Hox gene expression has been established. We will use Hoxa11eGFP reporter mice to monitor ectopic induction of the posterior Hox program in transduced cells and their resultant tumors. Use of MSCs from control and Hox mutant mouse lines will allow us to determine if posterior Hox genes are functionally required for the transformation process in vivo as our in vitro data suggest. With the biochemical, molecular and in vivo genetic tools the two labs have developed, successful demonstration of this novel hypothesis during this funding period will provide the basis for future highly impactful and mechanistic dissection of the etiology of Ewing's sarcoma, including a molecular basis for understanding the regional specificity of this tumor in vivo.

Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Molecular profiling – the practice of molecularly testing tumors in order to find specific gene or protein alterations which can be used to recommend targeted therapies – is increasingly used in oncology and is fast becoming a major part of precision medicine. In practice, each patient or physician generally receives a list of molecular anomalies and a list of therapies which are predicted to be beneficial or not beneficial based on the tumor molecular profile. This may lead to a difficult process of prioritizing therapies for individual patients. In the current proposal, we will develop computational network-based approaches to therapy recommendation by using existing resources to inform the connections between drugs and gene or protein variants. We will consider approaches both for creating “average” networks based on population-level data and for creating “patient-specific” networks based on an individual’s specific tumor profile. We will also design and implement an interactive data visualization approach for these networks which will be usable by both clinical researchers and clinicians. The methods and tools developed as part of this project will be entirely reproducible and shared with the community via open-source software packages and interactive tools. We believe our project could eventually lead the way to improving the way therapies are targeted to cancer patients.

project	5R33CA191245-03	R33CA191245	9329382	2017	Noninvasive detection of circulating RNAs for lung cancer early detection and prognosis	Grant	﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dismal rate of survival in lung cancer is primarily a result of late diagnosis, resistance to classical or targeted therapy, and post-treatment recurrence of disease. A patient-friendly early detection and prognosis method that detects cancer at an early stage, assesses response to treatment, and predicts risk of cancer recurrence would substantially reduce the mortality in this serious disease. Non-invasive 'liquid biopsy' relying on the detection of extracellular circulating RNAs (microRNAs and mRNAs) in patient blood samples has great potential to achieve this goal. Such biomarkers in serum/plasma can be sensitively quantified by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR of RNA isolated from the samples. However, this RNA isolation-qRT-PCR workflow cannot distinguish circulating RNAs secreted by cancer cells from those released physiologically and ubiquitously by all other, non-tumor cells of the body, making it potentially less sensitive or incapable of detecting cancer-specific RNA biomarkers. We recently developed a novel and simple tethered cationic lipoplex nanoparticle (tCLN) biochip with pre-loaded molecular beacons in the nanoparticles as probes to capture and detect cancer-specific RNAs in human serum without requiring pre- or post-sample processing. In this technology, negatively charged RNA molecules are easily captured by and fused with positively charged lipoplex nanoparticles, allowing their detection by the molecular beacons. Since both RNA targets and molecular beacons are confined within nanometer-sized liposome particles in a detection volume that is 1012 times smaller than that of a PCR reaction, this method not only provides very high detection sensitivity but also forfends the need for target amplification that qRT-PCR requires. We have demonstrated the feasibility of the tCLN biochip in detecting and quantifying extracellular miR-21 and let-7g microRNAs and Thyroid Transcription Factor-1 (TTF-1) mRNA in serum of lung cancer patients. The tCLN biochip could thus successfully distinguish early stage lung cancer patients from normal healthy controls, whereas the serum RNA isolation-qRT-PCR workflow was found to be completely ineffective for the task. We have assembled a strong multi-disciplinary team to further develop the tCLN biochip and to validate its feasibility using serum samples from smokers at high risk for developing lung cancer and from lung cancer patients. Our primary objectives are (1) to optimize the current tCLN biochip technology and to develop a microfluidic CLN (mCLN) biochip as a point-of-care diagnostic device; (2) to evaluate the performance of tCLN and mCLN biochips as a diagnostic tool for identifying lung cancer among individuals with computed tomography (CT)-detected solitary pulmonary nodules; and, (3) to evaluate the performance of tCLN and mCLN biochips as a prognostic tool using serum samples collected from early stage lung cancer patients before and at various time-points following surgical resection of cancer. We will also compare the tCLN and mCLN biochips with the traditional serum RNA isolation-qRT-PCR workflow for serum RNA detection sensitivity and specificity.

project	5R33CA192980-03	R33CA192980	9269176	2017	Advanced development and validation of targeted molecular counting methods for precise and ultrasensitive quantitation of low prevalence somatic mutations	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultrasensitive detection of clinically relevant somatic alterations in cancer genomes has great potential for impacting patient care, e.g. for early detection, establishing diagnoses, refining prognoses, guiding treatment, and monitoring recurrence. However, current technologies are poorly suited to the robust detection of somatic mutations present at very low frequencies (<1%). Massively parallel sequencing represents an advantageous path forward, but its sensitivity to detect very rare events is fundamentally constrained by the sequencing error rate. We have recently developed a new experimental paradigm that overcomes this limitation. In our approach, each copy of a target sequence that is present in a sample is molecularly tagged during the first cycle of a multiplex capture reaction with a unique random sequence. After amplification, target amplicons and their corresponding molecular tags are subjected to massively parallel sequencing. During analysis, the molecular tags are used to associate sequence reads sharing a common origin. Through oversampling, reads bearing the same molecular tag error-correct one another to yield an independent haploid consensus for each progenitor molecule. Furthermore, the collapsing of commonly derived reads inherently corrects for any allele-specific bias during amplification, such that estimates of mutant allele frequency can be accompanied by precise confidence bounds ("molecular counting"). Among other benefits, the approach is sensitive to at least 1 mutated sequence in a background of 10,000 unmutated copies. Here we propose the advanced development and validation of this approach for use as a clinical diagnostic. In our first aim, we will develop a multiplexed panel to broadly target common cancer associated mutations using this technology. In our second aim, we will apply the panel to the detection of minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia as a prognostic marker of disease relapse. In our third aim, we will apply the panel to detection of ultra-rare mutations in circulating cell-free DNA, which is released into circulation from dying tumor cells, as a robust and non-invasive cancer diagnostic. The panel will be rigorously validated for clinical use in both aims, with performance metrics appropriately designed for the two separate analytes. The availability of robust, cost-effective, quantitative, and generically applicable tools for the ultrasensitive, multiplex detection of rare somatic events in the clinical setting will provide enhanced, transformative capabilities in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancers. The methodology will also have application to basic science cancer research.

Making sure that the submitted material actually contains tumor, in sufficient quantity, is not always easy, and sometimes just preparing conventional microscope slides can consume most or even the entire specimen. We have developed a new, simple and inexpensive approach we term MUSE, for Microscopy with UV Surface Excitation, that can provide high-resolution images directly and quickly from fresh tissue without consuming it, and thus can preserve intact, high-quality specimens for biobanking, downstream molecular and functional analyses.  MUSE, by ensuring that acquired small biopsy specimens are indeed fit for purpose, can avoid the need to have a patient return at a later date for additional biopsies. In addition, the method will allow for lesion detection over larger cross-sections of tissue, such as organ whole-mounts, not currently practical with conventional instrumentation. Finally, we expect that MUSE will yield additional biologically informative imaging by avoiding artifacts inherent in conventional tissue processing and sectioning. We focus here on facilitation of tissue-based molecular studies, viable tumor harvest for xenografts and cultured spheroids, and biobanking, and include crucial validation studies to ensure that the MUSE process does not compromise sample utility due to possible impacts from exposure to intercalating dyes and/or UV light.  MUSE relies on two mechanisms: 1) surface-restricted excitation of fluorescent dyes due to micron- scale penetration of sub-300-nm ultraviolet light; and 2) the fact that many conventional dyes excited in this way emit visible light. These signals are bright enough to be detected by conventional color cameras using sub-second exposure times, allowing rapid imaging of large areas.  MUSE eliminates any requirement for conventional histology processing with formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, or thin-sectioning. It requires no lasers, confocal, multiphoton or optical coherence tomography instrumentation, can eventually cost in the range of a few thousands of dollars, and therefore affordable at the point of care (point of biopsy). MUSE samples are stained within seconds using familiar histology stains, such as eosin and DAPI, and the resulting high-resolution images converted from fluorescence to H&E-like brightfield appearance for interpretation in real time (but with novel and potentially useful features) easily interpreted by pathologists.  While rapid cellular-scale imaging of fresh tissue can have significant benefits in clinical arenas, it can also empower basic and translational research use for essentially instant histology-, pathology- or toxicology-relevant images directly from experimental animal models—at the bench—and may help relieve such investigators from having to rely on often overworked, sometimes unavailable, conventional histology and pathology services.

project	5R33CA206949-02	R33CA206949	9321964	2017	Advanced Development and Validation of 3 Dimensional Spheroid Culture of Primary Cancer Cells using Nano3D Technology	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional (2D) tissue culture models are highly simplified cancer models unable to capture the complexity and heterogeneity found in-vivo. Around 95% of new anticancer drugs eventually fail in clinical trial despite robust indications of activity in existing in vitro pre-clinical models, making in vitro testing some of the least predictive. Three dimensional (3D) spheroid culture models have recently advanced to bridge the “in- vitro to in-vivo gap” and provide the means for assembling more complex cancer relevant tissue microenvironments. Although these 3D models are being adopted by industry and the academic community, they have limitations and are hampered by low throughput, lack of consistency, high costs and the need for clinical validation. The Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (SRIMSC) in partnership with n3D Biosciences Inc., Greiner Bio-One USA Inc., Dr. Derek Duckett at Scripps Research department of Molecular Therapeutics and Dr. David Tuveson, M.D, Ph.D. at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), have created a strategic collaboration to advance a novel technology known as 3D magnetic bioprinting. Magnetic 3D bioprinting addresses the these critical issues by utilizing n3D's core technology known as the NanoShuttle to levitate and aggregate cells using magnetic forces to produce spheroids/organoids. The ultimate end product will be an affordable; HTS validated 384 and 1536 microplate format that supports rapid/consistent production of 3D spheroids for a wide array of cell types including primary tumor lines. The end goal is to accelerate 3D spheroid cultivation using screening automation, improve cost efficiency and allow for rapid drug testing such as FDA approved drugs in reformulation/repurposing studies. Advancement of this technology will be facilitated through the following: Aim 1: Validation of the current 384 well plate nanosphere technology in a HTS facility for automation compatibility. Compare 3D results to 2D models of KRAS pancreatic cancer cell models as provided by Dr. Tuveson. Aim 2: Validation of n3D spheroid technology for drug testing against select cytotoxic drugs, NCI approved oncology drug set and the Scripps FDA Approved drug collection. CC50 data, i.e. the concentration that produces 50% cellular cytotoxicity, in 2D and in 3D formats will be compared to published literature. Aim 3: n3D Biosciences will produce an advance 1536 well plate NanoShuttle driver compatible for HTS and drug discovery efforts. SRIMSC will evaluate and implement the higher density format for drug discovery utility which will culminate in its testing on a large library of ~150K compounds to demonstrate HTS readiness. Aim 4: The n3D spheroid technology will be employed against patient derived primary Glioblastoma Multiform (GBM) derived cells with the end goal of evaluating its utility in primary cancer cell research. Aim 5: The n3D spheroid technology will be evaluated in-vivo for pancreatic orthotopic tumor effect and its utility in preclinical research. The end goal is to transfer and implement this technology and methods worldwide for cancer research and early drug discovery.	3-Dimensional;Address;Adopted;Advanced Development;Animal Model;Antineoplastic Agents;Automation;Basic Cancer Research;Biological Assay;Biological Sciences;Biomedical Research;Biopsy;Cancer Biology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Line;Cell Proliferation;Cell model;Cell-Mediated Cytolysis;Cells;Cellular Spheroids;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Collection;Communities;Complex;Cytotoxic agent;Data;Detection;Dimensions;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Drops;Environment;Equipment;FDA approved;Force of Gravity;Geometry;Glioblastoma;Goals;Gold;Growth;Heterogeneity;Human;Image;In Vitro;Industry;KRAS2 gene;Laboratories;Libraries;Literature;Magnetism;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Medicine;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Nanosphere;Organoids;Pancreas;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Drug Evaluation;Primary Neoplasm;Procedures;Production;Publishing;Readiness;Reporting;Reproducibility;Research;Research Institute;Speed;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Translations;Transplantation;Tumor-Derived;Validation;Xenograft procedure;anticancer research;base;bioprinting;cancer cell;cell assembly;cell type;cost;cost effective;cost effectiveness;culture plates;density;drug discovery;drug testing;experimental study;high throughput screening;high throughput technology;improved;in vitro Model;in vitro testing;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;iron oxide;miniaturize;monolayer;mutant;nanoparticle;neoplastic cell;new technology;novel;novel anticancer drug;oncology;pancreatic cancer cells;personalized medicine;pre-clinical;pre-clinical research;precision medicine;scaffold;screening;small molecule;statistics;success;tissue culture;tumor;two-dimensional	SCRIPPS FLORIDA	JUPITER	FL	UNITED STATES	Timothy Patrick Spicer	DCB	Nastaran  Zahir	475865	$250k to $499k	475865	19-Jul-2017	1-Aug-2016	31-Jul-2019	RFA-CA-15-003	Moonshot

project	5R33CA212806-02	R33CA212806	9553703	2018	Ex vivo culture platform validation for preservation of patient derived multiple myeloma cells	Grant	Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B cell malignancy characterized by a clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM), the presence of high levels of monoclonal serum antibody, and the development of bone lesions. Despite the introduction of a number of novel treatments MM patients still are confronted with an average survival time of 5-7 years. Emerging evidence suggests that the endosteal niche at the bone-BM interface fosters the survival of drug-resistant MM cells, especially through adhesive interactions with osteoblasts, and is therefore responsible for relapse. Currently, treatment options for MM patients are evaluated mainly on the basis of clinical features and historical population response rates. Therefore, an important unmet clinical need is to develop the ability to select the best therapy for an individual based on the ex vivo response of the patient's MM cells (PMMCs) to drug treatment options. This precision medicine approach is expected to provide a transformative means of: (1) reducing ineffective therapies, (2) minimizing excess toxicity and cost, (3) inhibiting the development of the tumor cells' cross-resistance to additional drugs as a critical part of the long-term care of MM patients, and (4) assessing the probability of relapse occurrence. A major challenge, however, is the lack of clinically relevant, high-throughput and inexpensive models that preserve primary patient biospecimen for downstream analyses and use. The goal of this R33 project is to improve and validate a multiple myeloma (MM) culture platform, which was developed through the prior R21 award to enable the ex vivo preservation of PMMCs derived from BM biospecimens. The specific aims of the project are to: (1) increase the culture platform's high- throughput operation capability by implementing a gravity-driven, pumpless flow control strategy while preserving the feasibility of producing the device using industry standard materials and manufacturing practice and (2) prospectively correlate the ex vivo chemosensitivity and resistance of PMMCs with clinical response as a means of validating the predictive capability of our ex vivo MM culture platform and expand drug-resistant PMMCs for downstream characterization as a potential means of guiding subsequent treatment selection. Anticipated results will validate that ex vivo preserved MM biospecimens can be widely used with our culture platform for screening patient-specific treatment options as well as for other applications such as preclinical evaluation of new therapeutics, studying drug-resistant PMMC populations, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and ex vivo models of breast and prostate cancers that metastasize to BM and bone.

In particular, non- neuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an aggressive form of this disease, is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The main barriers against therapeutic advances are a paucity of relevant disease models and a very poor understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to this phenotype. The process of protein synthesis has long been considered subordinate to alterations at the levels of DNA and RNA in cancer etiology. However, work from our laboratory and others have revealed that protein synthesis control is a dynamic process that coordinates not only bulk mRNA translation, but also the specialized translation of distinct mRNAs important for cancer phenotypes. Recently, our laboratory has developed and characterized a new in vitro and in vivo toolkit of both human and murine androgen receptor-low CRPC. We have used these models to discover a critical link between androgen receptor signaling and the process of mRNA translation initiation, which is critical for androgen receptor-low CRPC growth. We hypothesize that androgen receptor-low CRPC is driven by the specific translation of distinct mRNA networks, thereby leading to persistent tumor growth, which may represent a therapeutic vulnerability. Our long-term objective is to utilize state-of-the-art mouse models, ribosome profiling, and patient derived xenografts to definitively investigate the fundamental link between the androgen receptor and protein synthesis control in a highly relevant and newly emerging disease course for prostate cancer patients. To do so, we will address the following aims: 1) determine the mechanism by which the androgen receptor communicates with the translation apparatus, 2) delineate how aberrant protein synthesis drives the translation of distinct oncogenic mRNAs, and 3) elucidate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting translation initiation in androgen receptor-low CRPC. Ultimately, these studies are poised to uncover a new paradigm for gene regulation in androgen receptor-low prostate cancer and provide the preclinical basis for targeting the protein synthesis apparatus in an increasingly common highly aggressive disease.

project	5R42CA183376-03	R42CA183376	9489181	2018	Noninvasive Contrast Enhanced Early Detection of Melanoma Liver Metastasis	Grant	Abstract The liver is the most common organ for metastasis of various cancers, including pancreatic, ovarian, colorectal, gastric cancers and melanoma. Uveal melanoma metastasizes in 40% of patients and upon metastasis targets the liver in 90% of these cases. The most common primary malignant liver cancer worldwide is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The use of blind liver biopsy as a diagnostic tool for liver cancer has many limitations including risks associated with the procedure and sampling bias and it cannot be performed repeatedly for longitudinal studies. Improving noninvasive imaging methodology would be a significant advance in early detection of small primary cancers and liver metastases for precision medicine. There is a critical need to develop MRI contrast agents capable of detecting primary and metastatic liver cancers earlier in their development than currently possible, and to provide insight into the biology of metastases through biomarkers for precision treatment. We have successfully met all of the proposed aims and milestones for Phase I. The main commercial goal of Inlighta Biosciences is to develop novel imaging reagents for preclinical and clinical applications.

project	5R42CA183376-04	R42CA183376	9707766	2019	Noninvasive Contrast Enhanced Early Detection of Melanoma Liver Metastasis	Grant	Abstract The liver is the most common organ for metastasis of various cancers, including pancreatic, ovarian, colorectal, gastric cancers and melanoma. Uveal melanoma metastasizes in 40% of patients and upon metastasis targets the liver in 90% of these cases. The most common primary malignant liver cancer worldwide is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The use of blind liver biopsy as a diagnostic tool for liver cancer has many limitations including risks associated with the procedure and sampling bias and it cannot be performed repeatedly for longitudinal studies. Improving noninvasive imaging methodology would be a significant advance in early detection of small primary cancers and liver metastases for precision medicine. There is a critical need to develop MRI contrast agents capable of detecting primary and metastatic liver cancers earlier in their development than currently possible, and to provide insight into the biology of metastases through biomarkers for precision treatment. We have successfully met all of the proposed aims and milestones for Phase I. The main commercial goal of Inlighta Biosciences is to develop novel imaging reagents for preclinical and clinical applications.

project	5R42CA228875-03	R42CA228875	9998915	2020	Targeting glioblastoma stem-like cells with custom-designed viral vectors	Grant	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of adult brain cancers with a median survival of <15 months despite aggressive standard chemoradiation. GBM are formed by GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) - a major contributor to tumor recurrence and a natural focus for therapeutic development. There are two main reasons responsible for treatment failure: 1) high intra- and inter-tumor cellular and molecular heterogeneity with multiple subclones possessing distinct genetic determinants; 2) GSCs exhibit multiple redundant signaling pathways requiring simultaneous targeting of overlapping pathways. We have invented and biologically validated a novel tandem computational platform, GeneRep-nSCORE that integrates large-scale gene expression profiles with genomic changes to identify common founding alterations or master regulators of GSCs that span a large number, if not all, GSC subclones within and across GBM tumors. We discovered such a core set of four common master regulators in GCSs that are outstanding targets for clinical development. Expression of these four factors was sufficient to reprogram normal astrocytes to GSCs, whereas their depletion profoundly abrogated GSCs, and thus tumor development in vivo, in all eight lines of patient-derived GSCs of varied genetic and molecular backgrounds examined to date. The goal of this application is to develop a customized set of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based genetic tools to target the whole spectrum of GSCs (Phase I) for the purpose of delivering targeting constructs to deplete the four common master regulators responsible for malignant transformation and proliferation in GSCs (Phase II). The specific objectives of this proposal are: (i) using directed evolution and available combinatorial AAV capsid library, and for the first time, introducing a dynamic mode of administration of a library reagent over the time course of tumor progression, to greatly increase the probability of identifying novel AAV variants specifically targeting slow-, and fast-cycling GSCs in patient-derived xenograft models (PDX) (Phase I); (ii) To design and validate a panel of AAV vectors that express shRNAs targeting core master regulators of GSCs to identify leads for preclinical testing; (iii) To optimize modes of viral delivery, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters, and safety and toxicity in normal and PDX treated with lead targeting AAV cassettes; and (iv) Based on these results, tools and basic DMPK data created, to conduct preclinical efficacy studies in PDX treated with lead targeting AAV cassettes either alone or in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy (Phase II) to prepare for an investigative new drug application for clinical testing in patients with GBM, and for commercial development of this novel technology.

project	5R44CA199826-03	R44CA199826	9534548	2018	Commercialization of an MRI contrast agent for differential diagnosis of prostate cancer.	Grant	Abstract  Prostate cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and the second most cause of cancer death of men in the US. Current methods to assess prostate cancer risk combine prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening and random prostate biopsy. Unfortunately, this strategy fails to reveal the lesion’s location and does not accurately differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers. As a result, most patients will receive unnecessary active treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in order to avoid under treatment. Active treatment involves surgery or radiation, often causing long-term side effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel urgency. Thus, development of non-invasive and accurate diagnostic imaging technology to localize and differentiate high-risk prostate cancer offer a new tool to assist physicians in risk-stratification and decision making and to spare millions patients with low- risk cancer from unnecessary aggressive treatment.  The mission of Molecular Theranostics (fka Prostate Theranostics) is to commercialize a novel molecular imaging approach that targets an oncoprotein associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer cell stemness, angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. The oncoprotein has a high expression in the tumor extracellular matrix of high-risk prostate cancer, low in low-grade tumor, none in normal tissues. The goal of this project is to commercialize a safe and effective targeted contrast agent for accurate early detection, localization, and differential diagnosis of high-risk prostate cancer with MRI. In phase I, we have optimized and identified a lead targeted MRI contrast agent for clinical translation. All of the milestones in Phase I of the project have been achieved. The agent possesses the superior ability of robust specific contrast enhancement in high-risk prostate cancer, not in slow growing low-risk tumors in animal models, and has the potential to visualize and differentiate high-risk prostate cancers with MRI.  The objectives of this SBIR Phase II are to develop a lead formulation of the contrast agent, to perform FDA required eIND enabling studies, and to commercialize the agent for clinical imaging prostate cancer. The specific aims are 1) to scale up the synthesis of the targeted contrast agent and develop a lead product formulation for pre-clinical study and clinical trials; 2) to validate the effectiveness of the formulation for prostate cancer imaging on a clinical MRI scanner and to determine its minimally effective dose; 3) to perform eIND-enabling pharmacokinetics and safety studies in rodents. Non-invasive accurate detection of prostate cancer is an unmet clinical need for prostate cancer management. Clinical trials will be initiated as soon as the eIND is approved by the FDA. Successful development of our imaging technology has the potential to accurately detect, localize, and diagnose prostate cancer, replace invasive prostate biopsy, and improve decision-making in clinical management of prostate cancer. It also has the potential for non-invasive active surveillance of prostate cancer and timely monitoring of disease progression, as well as image-guided therapy.

project	5R44CA216539-03	R44CA216539	9560694	2018	A Novel PET Probe for Use in Cancer Diagnostics	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality that utilizes radiolabeled molecules (“probes”) to target and measure biological processes. Researchers can use the same probes to examine microorganisms, cells, and mice as they do in patients to visualize and characterize the biology of disease, monitor its progression, and evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Over 4000+ PET probes have been developed to help answer a variety of biological questions, but only the glucose analog [18F]FDG is routinely used for molecular imaging diagnostics in patient care. There is still an unmet need to develop additional probes which can annotate other key aspects of cancer biochemistry, including those in which the diagnostics share common targets with drugs, to truly establish it as a key technology for realizing improved treatment and monitoring in personalized medicine. The clinical translation of next generation PET probes is hampered by a lack of multi-site infrastructure to robustly, reliably, and cost-effectively support their supply to fulfill the initial data generation required to determine safety and efficacy in humans. This is often a key issue in bridging the “gap” between proof-of-concept research and FDA approval; Pharma and Biotech, who face increasing pressure to use diagnostics to develop drugs more efficiently, require significant validation studies and a reliable supply to realize the value of a novel PET probe to their clinical program and invest in future studies. Thus, early clinical studies in this gap are currently relegated to single-site production, or must undergo a cost- and-time-prohibitive assimilation into a commercial radiopharmacy before they've been clinically vetted. To facilitate a paradigm shift in the enablement of novel PET probes for the clinical trial community, a fundamental change in production ideology and infrastructure re-imagining is required. Creating a network of academic radiochemistry cores that standardize and share synthesis, purification, formulation, and quality control protocols through automation and cloud-based applications for clinical production serves to reduce barriers to translating PET probes from the preclinical research environment to first-in-human studies, as well enable rapid dissemination of PET probes across multiple sites to spur and de-risk academic and industry collaboration. The overall goal of this proposal is to establish and deploy a novel, low cost, scalable approach to the clinical translation of a next generation PET probes for cancer, starting with candidate probe [18F]CFA, with potential commercialization as a predictive response biomarker for cancer immunotherapies in solid tumors (i.e. CTLA-4/PD1 blockade), a pharmacodynamic biomarker for dCK inhibitors, and a predictive response biomarker for chemotherapy nucleoside prodrugs.

project	5R44CA217528-03	R44CA217528	9786678	2019	Novel Fluorescent Diagnostic Agents for Detection, Staging, andIntraoperative Imaging of Tumors	Grant	Abstract The goal of this project is to develop IV injectable fluorescent agents for use in intraoperative imaging of peritoneal metastatic tumors. Significance: Peritoneal metastatic cancers have an incidence of 250,000/per year in the US and are primarily treated with surgery. Complete surgical tumor resection is a gold-standard treatment goal that can increase the 5-year patient survival to 50%, whereas incomplete tumor resection (<2mm) could drastically reduce the survival to a mere few months. Current clinical imaging technologies such as PET, MRI and CT have limitations for guiding cancer surgery including inability to be used intraoperatively due to safety associated with ionizing radiation, as well as limitations on sensitivity and tumor specificity especially for lesions smaller than 10mm. Conventional fluorescent molecular probes in development typically target tumor proteins and are limited in imaging the heterogeneous onco-geno-phenotypes of peritoneal metastasis that have multiple tissues of origin and vary in protein expression levels. In order to reduce incomplete tumor resection and improve survival, there is an urgent need for clear visual contrast imaging agents that enable more precise and specific detection of peritoneal metastasis tumors intraoperatively and in real-time. Hypothesis: OncoNano’s approach of targeting tumor acidosis which is ubiquitously expressed as a cancer biomarker across tumors, coupled with OncoNano’s ultra-sensitive pH fluorescent digital sensors, provides a broad based approach to image the heterogeneous peritoneal metastasis with high specificity and sensitivity. Preliminary Data: We have demonstrated that OncoNano’s fluorescent agents image tumors across a variety of solid tumor types (14 tested to date), including peritoneal metastasis to submillimeter precision in SCID mouse models. OncoNano’s agents provided a digital (ON-OFF) response which offered clear tumor delineation, and lower detection limits (>10x) compared with state of the art PET-FDG imaging. Surgical tumor resection using OncoNano imaging agent showed significant (40-50%) survival benefit in SCID mouse models compared with conventional white light based surgery. Specific Aims: The scientific aims of this project will enable OncoNano to clinically translate, the ultrasensitive pH probes and develop it from the lab bench through to establishing reproducible manufacturing of a stable formulation, to establishing safety and pharmacology, for an FDA IND filing. The specific aims in the SBIR Phase I, addresses the nanoprobe stability requirement, and addresses the nanoprobe sensitivity and specificity requirement in in-vivo models. The specific aims in Phase 2 of the project addresses the critical milestones on the path to clinical translation including- the scale-up requirement to meet the GLP and human testing needs, a demonstration of product safety in GLP in-vivo studies, culminating in an IND filing with the FDA.

project	5R44CA221624-02	R44CA221624	9568748	2018	Monitoring immune response to immunotherapies in cancer patients with VisAcT PET tracer	Grant	Abstract CellSight is a clinical stage company developing PET imaging tools that can increase the probability of clinical success of immunotherapies by determining early in the therapeutic regimen if the cancer patient is responding to their immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapies that harness the body's immune system to help fight cancer do not work for everyone; in fact, success rates can be as low as 20%. This means that up to 80% of patients undergoing immunotherapy are spending over $100,000 and investing 6 to 10 months on ineffective treatments. Our lead imaging tracer, [18F]-FAraG product named VisAcT, leverages existing health and PET imaging infrastructure but is specific for visualizing immune response. This whole body visualization will provide clinicians critical information to help make early decisions in the treatment regimen and increase chances of patient survival. CellSight is partnering with pharma and academia on various projects to validate this critically needed immune response monitoring tool as immunotherapies and combinational therapies are showing great promise. The sheer number of combinations are staggering yet there are no blood biomarkers or imaging tools available that can be predictive of responders versus nonresponders. Even if accurate blood biomarkers were to became available in the near future, whole body imaging will still be critically needed to determine local immune response site by site in the metastatic patient who are the ones being administered immunotherapies. Clinical symptoms during immunotherapy are very perplexing, as it might seem a patient is progressing when in fact their immune system is actively fighting the cancer or there might be a delay before immune response is apparent through traditional measures. An immune response monitoring tool, such as VisAcT, will be key in enabling success for immunotherapies. VisAcT was first discovered and developed in the Gambhir lab (Chair of Radiology at Stanford) and is exclusively licensed to CellSight. CellSight has obtained an IND primarily through funding from the NCI. We are currently conducting Phase 1 clinical trials at University of California San Francisco for various solid tumors including Melanoma, Lung and Bladder under Drs, Daud, Gubens and Fong respectively and are about to launch a Head/Neck cancer trial at Stanford under Dr. Colevas. Our primary target market is the immuno-oncology market however since the tracer shows immune response that is specific to activated T cells it can be useful for other immune modulated diseases such as Graft vs Host Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Our team, including Michael Karin, Ph.D. and Shabnam Shalapour, Ph.D. at UCSD School of Medicine and Hidekazu Tsukamoto, D.V.M., Ph.D. and Anthony El-Khoueiry, M.D. at USC Keck School of Medicine, represents an ideal blend of basic researchers, translational scientists and oncologists who are interested in HCC molecular pathogenesis and treatment, especially in HCC caused by non-alcoholic (NASH) and alcoholic (ASH) steatohepatitis. Although the US incidence of HCC and its associated mortality have nearly tripled in the past generation, insufficient effort has been made toward identification and development of innovative and effective HCC therapies. However, the ideal and timely confluence of basic preclinical research and applied clinical studies carried out by our team members has the potential to critically transform HCC treatment forever. Together we found that chronic liver inflammation results in suppression of HCC-protective immunosurveillance to support rapid malignant progression. This unique immunopathogenic mechanism renders HCC responsive to drugs that disrupt the PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint, but even the impressive response seen thus far and the selection of patients who will benefit from this therapeutic approach can be further improved. Such improvements can only be achieved by a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitors act, the factors that determine their efficacy, and the causes of treatment failure. We will achieve these goals through integrated studies of clinical specimens collected by Dr. El-Khoueiry and sophisticated, faithful and robust mouse models of non-viral HCC developed by Drs. Tsukamoto, Shalapour, and Karin. The immune mechanisms that control NASH- and ASH-driven HCC development in these models are highly similar to those that operate in human patients. Using this integrated approach, we will pursue five specific aims: 1) determine whether serum IgA concentrations correlate with therapeutic response to PD-1 blockade in patients with non-viral HCC; 2) develop reliable mouse models of ASH-driven HCC; 3) compare the immunosuppressive mechanisms that contribute to development of NASH- and ASH-driven HCC and control their response to PD-L1 blockade; 4) determine whether excessive peritumoral fibrosis correlates with diminished response to PD-1 blockade in HCC patients; and 5) determine whether agents that inhibit or attenuate stellate cell activation potentiate the response to PD- 1/PD-L1 blockade in non-viral HCC. The successful completion of these studies will result in substantial improvements to HCC immunotherapy and will establish reliable procedures for identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 targeting drugs, advances that will result in significant cost savings which may amount to hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

Our team, including Michael Karin, Ph.D. and Shabnam Shalapour, Ph.D. at UCSD School of Medicine and Hidekazu Tsukamoto, D.V.M., Ph.D. and Anthony El-Khoueiry, M.D. at USC Keck School of Medicine, represents an ideal blend of basic researchers, translational scientists and oncologists who are interested in HCC molecular pathogenesis and treatment, especially in HCC caused by non-alcoholic (NASH) and alcoholic (ASH) steatohepatitis. Although the US incidence of HCC and its associated mortality have nearly tripled in the past generation, insufficient effort has been made toward identification and development of innovative and effective HCC therapies. However, the ideal and timely confluence of basic preclinical research and applied clinical studies carried out by our team members has the potential to critically transform HCC treatment forever. Together we found that chronic liver inflammation results in suppression of HCC-protective immunosurveillance to support rapid malignant progression. This unique immunopathogenic mechanism renders HCC responsive to drugs that disrupt the PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint, but even the impressive response seen thus far and the selection of patients who will benefit from this therapeutic approach can be further improved. Such improvements can only be achieved by a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitors act, the factors that determine their efficacy, and the causes of treatment failure. We will achieve these goals through integrated studies of clinical specimens collected by Dr. El-Khoueiry and sophisticated, faithful and robust mouse models of non-viral HCC developed by Drs. Tsukamoto, Shalapour, and Karin. The immune mechanisms that control NASH- and ASH-driven HCC development in these models are highly similar to those that operate in human patients. Using this integrated approach, we will pursue five specific aims: 1) determine whether serum IgA concentrations correlate with therapeutic response to PD-1 blockade in patients with non-viral HCC; 2) develop reliable mouse models of ASH-driven HCC; 3) compare the immunosuppressive mechanisms that contribute to development of NASH- and ASH-driven HCC and control their response to PD-L1 blockade; 4) determine whether excessive peritumoral fibrosis correlates with diminished response to PD-1 blockade in HCC patients; and 5) determine whether agents that inhibit or attenuate stellate cell activation potentiate the response to PD- 1/PD-L1 blockade in non-viral HCC.

project	5U01AI156189-02	U01AI156189	10189523	2021	Finding the optimal balance of immunotherapy efficacy and toxicity.	Grant	U01 Abstract Despite extensive research into cancer immunotherapy, immune-related adverse events (irAE) remain a critical and poorly understood issue. To address this critical need, we have assembled a multidisciplinary research team with broad and relevant expertise. The co-PIs of this proposal have expertise in cancer immunotherapy, immunology, assay development, and bioinformatics. Together, we have assembled a cohort of ~400 cancer patients treated with ICI, collecting longitudinal treatment, efficacy, and toxicity data, as well as blood samples at pre-treatment baseline, throughout therapy, and at time of toxicity. In our real-world data set, over 10 percent of cases have a history of autoimmune disease, providing insight into use of ICI in a population widely excluded from clinical trials yet routinely treated with these therapies off protocol. Our high-quality clinical data annotation—without which correlative studies have little meaning—addresses the reality that irAE may occur months after ICI initiation and are far more complex to detect and characterize than toxicities of conventional chemotherapy or molecularly targeted therapies. Through existing funding mechanisms, we have already completed autoantibody, cytokine, genetic, and functional assays in these cases. However, we do not currently have resources for comprehensive, integrated analysis of these diverse laboratory and clinical data. The overarching goal of this U01 proposal is to determine the optimal balance between ICI efficacy and toxicity, ultimately identifying a set of biomarkers useful for selection of patients, treatment type and duration, and clinical monitoring. We will achieve this through determination of cellular immunity, comprehensive data analysis, and clinical validation. We have three Aims: (1) Determine cellular immunity in patients experiencing irAE and/or achieving beneficial responses from ICI. We will perform mass cytometry (CyTOF) and T-cell receptor sequencing at multiple time-points. (2) Determine genetic, humoral, and cellular factors associated with irAE and/or beneficial responses from ICI. We will develop a database to integrate and analyze the CyTOF and T-cell receptor sequencing data with clinical efficacy and toxicity data, as well as data from the assays already completed through other mechanisms. (3) Perform analytical and clinical validation of emerging biomarkers. We will apply the best classifying phenotypes emerging from our comprehensive and integrated data analysis to a test set of patients from our existing cohort, eventually identifying a subset of biomarkers with potential for clinical application. Together, these Aims directly address the FOA purpose of reducing the incidence and/or severity of irAE while retaining anti- tumor efficacy.

The study was designed to take advantage of the ethnic and cultural diversity of the two geographic areas, as well as the expertise of the investigators in nutrition, ethnic/racial studies, and genetics. It is the most ethnically diverse cancer cohort in existence. It achieves high cost-efficiency by supplementing active follow-up information with computerized linkages to SEER, vital statistics, hospital-discharge diagnoses, medical claim data, electronic medical records and geospatial information. At baseline, the cohort included information on 215,000 men and women, comprised almost entirely of five ethnic/racial populations: Caucasians, Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, African Americans, and Latinos. The resource was later expanded to include a prospective biorepository of blood and urine specimens from ~70,000 of the participants. Leadership of the MEC entails a highly interactive, team approach; and the investigators have amply demonstrated their willingness to share data/samples, and to participate actively in consortia. This application describes our aims over the next 5 years for maintaining and enhancing the infrastructure of the MEC, as well as plans for methodological research. Research accomplishments include significant contributions to understanding both genetic and environmental risk factors for cancer. Over 280 papers describing our findings have been published during the current grant cycle. In addition, over the last 20 years, 98 research grants have been built around the MEC, and more than 75 students and postdoctoral fellows have been trained on the study. This grant renewal will make possible the continuation of a well-integrated program of research aimed at evaluating environmental and genetic risk factors for cancer and other common chronic diseases, taking advantage of new approaches, such as genomics, microbiomics, adductomics and metabolomics. The MEC will allow the testing of innovative research hypotheses aimed at ensuring that progress in prevention applies to major US ethnic/racial minorities.

project	5U01CA164973-10	U01CA164973	10245003	2021	Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study	Grant	This renewal application seeks support for the infrastructure of the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study, which was established in Hawaii and southern California in 1993-1996 to study risk factors for cancer and other chronic diseases. The study was designed to take advantage of the ethnic and cultural diversity of the two geographic areas, as well as the expertise of the investigators in nutrition, ethnic/racial studies, and genetics. It is the most ethnically diverse cancer cohort in existence. It achieves high cost-efficiency by supplementing active follow-up information with computerized linkages to SEER, vital statistics, hospital-discharge diagnoses, medical claim data, electronic medical records and geospatial information. At baseline, the cohort included information on 215,000 men and women, comprised almost entirely of five ethnic/racial populations: Caucasians, Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, African Americans, and Latinos. The resource was later expanded to include a prospective biorepository of blood and urine specimens from ~70,000 of the participants. Leadership of the MEC entails a highly interactive, team approach; and the investigators have amply demonstrated their willingness to share data/samples, and to participate actively in consortia. This application describes our aims over the next 5 years for maintaining and enhancing the infrastructure of the MEC, as well as plans for methodological research. Research accomplishments include significant contributions to understanding both genetic and environmental risk factors for cancer. Over 280 papers describing our findings have been published during the current grant cycle. In addition, over the last 20 years, 98 research grants have been built around the MEC, and more than 75 students and postdoctoral fellows have been trained on the study. This grant renewal will make possible the continuation of a well-integrated program of research aimed at evaluating environmental and genetic risk factors for cancer and other common chronic diseases, taking advantage of new approaches, such as genomics, microbiomics, adductomics and metabolomics. The MEC will allow the testing of innovative research hypotheses aimed at ensuring that progress in prevention applies to major US ethnic/racial minorities.

project	5U01CA199334-03	U01CA199334	9335321	2017	Comparative Modeling to Inform Cervical Cancer Control Policies	Grant	﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite successful cervical cancer screening in the United States, over 12,000 women develop and 4,000 women die from cervical cancer each year. New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually-transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, represent tremendous opportunities for innovative and efficient cervical cancer programs in the U.S. but also pose significant challenges for decision making, due to the complex and long natural history of disease and the different time points along the disease spectrum at which interventions are applied. Consequently, policy makers are uniquely reliant on mathematical modeling to provide evidence on the optimal cervical cancer control strategies. These models can be used to integrate the most up-to-date data, extrapolate current short- term findings into long-term outcomes, and evaluate what-if scenarios that would otherwise be impractical or infeasible to conduct in clinical studies. There has been a growing number of independent mathematical models that have been developed to address clinical and policy questions with respect to cervical cancer prevention and control but no formal efforts to compare assumptions and results across models. As part of the CISNET consortium, a group of established cervical cancer modelers from the U.S., Australia, and the Netherlands will engage in a formal collaboration of comparative modeling using a series of state-of-the-art mathematical models of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis. We will pursue analyses related to the historical impact of screening, the comparative effectiveness of current and anticipated HPV vaccination and screening strategies, and optimal routes for reducing cervical cancer disparities.

Currently, the most critical bottleneck in the precision medicine workflow is at the interpretation step. However, there are few resources to help with the prioritization and interpretation of these alterations in a clinical context. Multiple groups are building their own databases documenting clinical interpretation of tumor mutations as they are observed in those groups. This represents a largely redundant effort with no mechanisms for capturing evolving evidence from the biomedical literature. Public knowledgebases are needed with sophisticated application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow rapid intersection of genomic alterations with interpretations of their clinical actionability. The goal of this proposal is to develop such an expert-curated knowledgebase, web interface and API for Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC - www.civicdb.org). The knowledge created from this effort will be freely available and the product of open discussion across a diverse community. This will require an interdisciplinary approach to combine the expertise of genome scientists and cancer researchers, whose efforts are otherwise often isolated. Content will be created with transparency, kept current, be comprehensive, track provenance, and acknowledge the efforts of creators. It will cover all types of alterations from single nucleotide variants to structural variants, RNA fusions, expression changes, epigenetic alterations and others. The interface will capture both structured statements of evidence for actionability to allow computational data mining and also human-readable interpretations. Content and software will be unencumbered and easy to access to encourage both academic and commercial engagement. In order to achieve these goals CIViC will require well-designed data standards, use of structured vocabularies, and a user-friendly curation interface that balances data mining needs with human accessibility. Focused `hackathons' and curation meetings will be organized to establish community standards and coordinate with synergistic efforts by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and ClinGen working groups. The CIViC resource will serve as the foundation for development of applications critical to widespread implementation of precision medicine for cancer. Specifically, it will facilitate rapid generation of targeted sequencing assays, automated clinical report generation, and other applications built upon the open CIViC standards and APIs.

This increasingly accurate mutational landscape has led to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic interventions. However, there is widespread biological and clinical heterogeneity in tumors, even when they share the same driver oncogene mutation. In addition, a high degree of dynamic plasticity and adaptability makes cancers display complex patterns of acquired resistance that manifest clinically. In a similar way, the wide variability of clinical responses to immunotherapy and the onset of immune escape, are becoming a formidable obstacle to fully realize the potential of many new and potentially effective immunotherapies. In this project we will evaluate a rational systematic approach to characterize oncogenic states and their most salient genomic and immune hallmarks in order to infer optimal combinations of pharmacologic and immunological perturbagens that disrupt cancer cell and tumor microenvironment interaction and viability. Our approach is based on our preliminary data, which suggests that in each identifiable oncogenic state there is a close interplay between activation of oncogenic elements, cellular pathways and the immune microenvironment. The project will test this approach with three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Characterize 5-10 pan-cancer oncogenic states with well-defined genomic and immune hallmarks including their specific molecular targets and sensitivity to perturbagens. Aim 2. Computationally infer optimal combinations of pharmacological and immunological perturbagens. Aim 3. Experimentally validate single and combinations of perturbagens identified in Aim 2. This innovative approach will provide a rich source of CTD2 datasets and resources including a catalog of oncogenic states, their most salient genomic and immune hallmarks, associated targets and validated combinations of pharmacologic and immune therapies that are effective at targeting tumors.

This increasingly accurate mutational landscape has led to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic interventions. However, there is widespread biological and clinical heterogeneity in tumors, even when they share the same driver oncogene mutation. In addition, a high degree of dynamic plasticity and adaptability makes cancers display complex patterns of acquired resistance that manifest clinically. In a similar way, the wide variability of clinical responses to immunotherapy and the onset of immune escape, are becoming a formidable obstacle to fully realize the potential of many new and potentially effective immunotherapies. In this project we will evaluate a rational systematic approach to characterize oncogenic states and their most salient genomic and immune hallmarks in order to infer optimal combinations of pharmacologic and immunological perturbagens that disrupt cancer cell and tumor microenvironment interaction and viability. Our approach is based on our preliminary data, which suggests that in each identifiable oncogenic state there is a close interplay between activation of oncogenic elements, cellular pathways and the immune microenvironment. The project will test this approach with three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Characterize 5-10 pan-cancer oncogenic states with well-defined genomic and immune hallmarks including their specific molecular targets and sensitivity to perturbagens. Aim 2. Computationally infer optimal combinations of pharmacological and immunological perturbagens. Aim 3. Experimentally validate single and combinations of perturbagens identified in Aim 2. This innovative approach will provide a rich source of CTD2 datasets and resources including a catalog of oncogenic states, their most salient genomic and immune hallmarks, associated targets and validated combinations of pharmacologic and immune therapies that are effective at targeting tumors. These results will lead directly to the development of clinical trials, novel treatment strategies and provide the foundation for a new generation of more comprehensive, functional-based, precision medicine approaches.    	Anatomy;Antibodies;Bayesian Method;Cancer Vaccines;Cancer cell line;Catalogs;Cell Survival;Cells;Cellular immunotherapy;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Communities;Complex;Computer Models;Data;Data Set;Development;Elements;Epitopes;Foundations;Gene Expression;Generations;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Human;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immunologics;Immunotherapy;Knock-out;Lead;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Molecular Target;Mutation;Natural Killer Cells;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Pharmacology;Resistance;Resources;Signal Pathway;Solid Neoplasm;Source;System;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;anticancer research;base;biological heterogeneity;cancer cell;cancer classification;cancer genome;chimeric antigen receptor;clinical development;clinical heterogeneity;immune checkpoint;innovation;mouse model;mutational status;neoantigens;new therapeutic target;novel;patient derived xenograft model;precision medicine;predictive modeling;response;synergism;targeted treatment;therapeutically effective;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO	LA JOLLA	CA	UNITED STATES	Ezra  Cohen,Dan S Kaufman,JILL P.

This is particularly true for glioblastoma (GBM) where prognosis  has increased only by 2-3 months over the last 75 years with a 5-year survival of less than 4%. Many promising  preclinical studies have failed to live up to expectations when tested clinically. This problem is likely due to: a)  limitations of the preclinical model system and b) lack of reliable biomarkers for proper patient selection. To  address these issues, investigators are increasingly utilizing patient-­derived models of cancer (PDMC) coupled  with comprehensive molecular profiling. However, differences in model composition, growth conditions, and  other microenvironmental factors limit reliability of these models and hamper interpretation. We believe that a  careful investigation of tumor microenvironmental (TME) stressors on 3 patient­derived models (xenolines) of  GBM, namely xenografts (PDX), spheroid cultures (neurospheres), and human biomatrix embedded 3D  microtumors, will provide insight into critical aspects of tumor biology that are influenced by model and TME.  These models pre­ and post­ TME perturbagen will also be comprehensively profiled at the genomic,  transcriptomic, and kinomic (global kinase activity assessment through a peptide substrate microarray) level to  generate a similarity distance metric. We hypothesize that application of TME stressors to the PDMC’s will  improve both molecular and biological fidelity of the respective models to that of the original tumor or parent  xenoline that can be visualized and in silico tested using an advanced computational data modeling system  (GeneTerrain). Our preliminary data generated from prior NIH funded projects indicate that our existing xenolines  recapitulate all four molecular subtypes of GBM identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas while reproducing the  key hallmarks of GBM when implanted orthotopically in immunocompromised mice. Importantly, we can grow  disaggregated xenoline tumors in a novel three-dimensional (3D) culture system incorporating many cells of the  tumor microenvironment to produce 3D microtumors suitable for higher throughput drug testing. Moreover, we  have preliminary evidence that TME manipulation of BTICs or 3D microtumors (e.g., hypoxia or nutrient  deprivation) promotes a more aggressive tumor phenotype in vitro and in vivo that is accompanied by changes  in kinomic signatures. Therefore, we will: 1) Generate 3 PDMC models from existing xenolines as well as de  novo GBM patient tumors with comprehensive omic testing to calculate similarity distance metrics among the  models with corresponding biological assessments including growth, chemoradiation sensitivity, and stemness  markers;; 2) Perform TME perturbagen testing of the derivative PDMCs (neurospheres and 3D microtumors) and  determine impact on tumor biology and similarity distance metric;; 3) Develop and validate GeneTerrain models  of the various PDMCs with respect to TME and therapeutic sensitivity (radiation and temozolomide).	3-Dimensional;Address;Behavior;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Models;Biology;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Cancer Biology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Fraction;Cell Line;Cell Proliferation;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Communities;Complex;Computer Simulation;Consensus;Coupled;Data;Data Science;Dimensions;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Elements;Environment;Exhibits;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Failure;Funding;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Glucose;Goals;Gold;Grant;Growth;Growth Factor;Human;Hypoxia;Immunocompromised Host;Implant;In Vitro;Investigation;Knowledge;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurable;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mus;Nutrient;Oxygen;Parents;Patient Selection;Patients;Peptides;Performance;Phenotype;Phosphotransferases;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Predictive Cancer Model;Property;Radiation;Radiation Tolerance;Radiation therapy;Reproducibility;Research Personnel;Sampling;Serum;Signal Transduction;Standard Model;Stress;System;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Therapeutic;Tumor Biology;Tumor Initiators;United States National Institutes of Health;Xenograft procedure;anticancer research;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cell immortalization;chemoradiation;clinical practice;cost;data modeling;drug development;drug discovery;drug testing;established cell line;expectation;experience;human disease;human model;immortalized cell;improved;in vivo;insight;molecular subtypes;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;novel;nutrient deprivation;outcome forecast;patient response;pre-clinical;preclinical study;pressure;standard of care;stem;stem-like cell;stemness;stressor;temozolomide;therapy resistant;three dimensional cell culture;tool;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor xenograft;vector	UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM	BIRMINGHAM	AL	UNITED STATES	Jake Yue Chen,Xiangqin  Cui,G.

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in establishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication between cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize macrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific metabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making Arginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer cells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of matched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of cancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie “microtumors”) and a unique dual recombinase genetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with inhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition, overcoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.

project	5U01CA224146-03	U01CA224146	10250566	2021	Systematic interrogation of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment in patient-derived specimens	Grant	Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 8%. Despite success in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC demonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly understood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an improved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will enable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future immunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that target tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this project, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic PDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will utilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at unprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these studies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional evaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to investigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and improve immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in PDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME and identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating disease.

project	5U01CA224151-03	U01CA224151	10267779	2021	Canine Immuno Neurotherapeutics	Grant	ABSTRACT: The dog is an ideal large animal model for diagnostic and therapeutic studies and can be used to translate successes to human patients while providing compassionate care to animals and advancing the field of veterinary medicine. Pet dogs share their environment, and oftentimes their diet, with their owners. Dogs and humans develop sporadic benign and malignant brain tumors at about the same rate and with similar histopathology. Dogs are often euthanized due to the cost of care. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people as well as pets through comparative oncology and genomics and the “One Medicine” approach to research and direct clinical application. We propose a multi-institutional consortium to test an innovative combinatorial immunotherapeutic approach in dogs that spontaneously and sporadically develop malignant glial brain tumors that resemble in most important aspects, high-grade malignant gliomas in humans. Our approach will inject a clinical grade oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV) M032 that expresses human interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the resected tumor bed. Dog lymphocytes fully respond to human IL-12 [1] and oncolytic HSV infect and kill canine (as well as mouse, non-human primate, human) tumor cells, creating a potent local inflammatory response and an antigen-rich tumor cell debris field. Therefore, we would anticipate that this virally-based immunotherapeutic approach would likely be as effective in dogs with brain tumors as in humans with brain tumors. We will conduct longitudinal safety, survival and correlative biology evaluations as a means of assessing the dog as an appropriate and informative model for design and implementation of clinical studies in humans with high-grade malignant brain tumors. To extend these findings, we propose, in subsequent studies, to combine the HSV immunotherapy approach with molecules that block the action of innate checkpoint inhibitor(s). These studies are designed to address key issues of safety and efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy in the dog that can be translated to humans with malignant gliomas. Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in humans, accounting for 30% of all primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors in adults. [2] With few major advances in decades, there has been no significant reduction in mortality and only a modest improvement in median survival. Recently, objective responses and long-term survivals have been observed in human glioma patients who have received oncolytic virotherapy and a Phase I trial is currently underway at UAB in patients using M032 alone. New approaches to utilize checkpoint inhibitors promises improved efficacy, but the ability to develop more effective combinatorial approaches has been slow, in large part due to lack of a faithful model of spontaneous glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people and pets through comparative oncology and genomics using the “One Medicine“ approach to research and direct clinical application.

Despite this progress, up to 40% of patients will ultimately succumb to their disease. Furthermore, even when treatment is successful, cytotoxic chemotherapy carries a high risk of long- term morbidities that impact quality of life. The recent success of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of lymphoma demonstrates the potential for additional progress in long-term disease control of DLBCL, with less toxicity. The molecular and genetic phenotype of canine DLBCL has been studied and it often resembles the activated B cell (ABC) category typically associated with aggressive DLBCL in people. Moreover, there is now substantial data that specific genetic changes and pathway aberrations are conserved across dogs and people with DLBCL supporting the notion that the canine disease can be used as a relevant spontaneous large animal model of the human counterpart. Toward this end, the purpose of this proposal is to use dogs with spontaneous naïve DLBCL to rapidly evaluate rational small molecule/immunotherapy combination approaches, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most effective combination to move forward in human patients with DLBCL. Specifically, we hypothesize that optimal combinations of anti-CD20, anti- PD1, XPO1 inhibition, NAMPT/PAK4 and PI3Kdelta inhibition will have better outcomes than doxorubicin based chemotherapy, resulting in a “chemo-free” blueprint for future human trials. Using an adaptive mini-pilot trial approach, those combinations deemed antagonistic and/or associated with unacceptable adverse events can be rapidly removed from consideration, while those with clear therapeutic promise can be most effectively studied in the front-line setting and enhanced. We will accomplish this by first determining the optimal chemo-free regimen with small molecule/ anti-CD20 combinations, then identifying the optimal chemo-free regimen with small molecule/anti-PD1 combinations and finally, by evaluating a frontline chemo-free novel combination regimen in canine DLBCL to demonstrate superiority to standard R-CHOP-based chemotherapy. Additionally, we will interrogate correlative biomarkers based on RNA sequencing of tumor samples obtained from dogs enrolled into the prospective trials and develop signatures that can be used to predict not only response to therapy, but more importantly long-term progression-free survival. Together, the data generated from this proposal will create a framework for effectively leveraging information gained from integrated immunotherapeutic trials in canine patients with DLBCL to develop chemo-free strategies that ultimately improve human outcomes.

In the field of immunotherapy, dogs offer an innovative model for translational research, as they present many of the challenges faced in “scaling up” therapeutic systems dependent on complex interactions between multiple cell types yet under more controlled settings. They also allow for long-term assessment of efficacy and toxicities. Canine clinical trials offer unique access to a rich source of spontaneously occurring, genetically and immunologically diverse cancers with the benefits of reduced time, expense, and regulatory hurdles of a human trial. The similarities between canine and human cancers are increasingly being realized. The publicly available canine genome has propelled comparative genomics studies that have shown significant homology between dogs and humans for recognized cancer-associated genes including MET, IGF1R, mTOR, and KIT. Not surprisingly, cytogenetic abnormalities that define human cancers, i.e. BCR-Abl translocations in chronic myelogenous leukemia and RB1 deletions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been found in comparable canine cancers. Intracranial neoplasia occurs frequently in dogs with a reported prevalence from 0.15 to 4.5% compared to 18.2 cases per 100,000 human. Astrocytoma or glioma account for 20-36% of primary brain tumors in dogs and 25% in humans. Brachycephalic breeds such as Boxers, French and English bulldogs, and Boston terriers have a significantly increased risk of developing gliomas. Primary canine brain tumors have similar histologic classification as those reported by the World Health Organization for human brain tumors. Similar to that in humans, the prognosis for dogs with brain tumors in general is poor regardless of therapeutic intervention. However, much less is known about canine glioma treatment outcomes because only a small number of studies with few dogs have been reported. There is little information about median survival time for dogs with glioma that received any type of treatment, but estimates of days to 2 or 3 months are often given to owners. The clinical similarities between dogs and humans suggest that dogs may represent an outstanding model for testing targeted therapies; both dogs and humans might benefit from these studies. Herein, we are proposing a multi-pronged immunotherapeutic approach to improve efficacy and survival times. We hypothesize that combination immunotherapy in a canine glioma model will enhance efficacy and accelerate successful translation into phase I human trials for GBM. The objective is to use pet dogs with spontaneous GBM to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of combination immunotherapy. We propose two Specific Aims: 1. Determine the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in spontaneous canine GBM in combination with standard of care, and 2. Assess the efficacy of immune-mediated gene therapy in combination with CD200 blockade to enhance anti-glioma immunotherapy.

project	5U01CA224166-03	U01CA224166	10260613	2021	Enhancing natural killer immunotherapy with first-in-dog trials of inhaled recombinant IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15 in naturally occurring canine cancers	Grant	Project Summary This proposal seeks to build on our extensive preliminary data in canine immunotherapy trials to demonstrate that novel methods of exogenous cytokine delivery in combination with autologous natural killer (NK) cells in first-in-dog clinical trials represents a potentially high impact approach to optimize non-T cell based immunotherapies. This work is targeted to dogs with typically lethal, naturally occurring osteosarcoma (OSA) and melanoma, and the findings are expected to have important relevance for the design and translation of innovative immunotherapy approaches in humans. Inhaled (IH) IL-15 offers the advantages of local delivery of this immune-stimulatory cytokine, while limiting systemic exposure and thus potential toxicity. Super-agonist IL- 15 offers increased half-life and greater anti-tumor effects. Therefore, each of these cytokines is anticipated to alter the risk/benefit ratio in favor of their use. To accomplish these objectives, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) Targeting gross pulmonary metastases (OSA and melanoma) with first-in-dog delivery of inhaled (IH) human IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15; 2) Phase II trial of IH IL-15 and autologous NK cells to treat gross OSA and melanoma pulmonary metastases, and; 3) Targeting micro-metastatic disease using super- agonist IL-15 in primary OSA. The canine model represents a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy research as an important link between murine models and human clinical studies. Dogs represent an attractive outbred combination of companion animals that experience spontaneous cancer development in the setting of an intact immune system. Importantly, these studies are designed to evaluate novel treatment combinations for advanced pulmonary metastases in the setting of gross disease, but also will determine the impact of this approach as first-line therapy when combined with standard-of-care treatments. Moreover, this work seeks to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate an anti-tumor response (or non-response) in dogs with naturally occurring cancers. We will have the unique opportunity to perform whole exome sequencing and RNASeq on tumor tissue pre- and post-immunotherapy, and we will investigate whether a signature of mutational landscape and gene expression profiles can be developed to prospectively predict outcome and response to immune therapies. We will correlate these data to immunohistochemical, flow cytometry, and serum cytokine readouts for evidence of transition from “cold” to “hot” tumors predictive of favorable long term outcome. Hence, these canine trials and bio-marker studies represent an ideal strategy to inform and facilitate the rapid translation of novel, potentially high impact immune therapies to human patients with aggressive cancers.

Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic response, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to presumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking. 3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme outcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular immunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term survivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and that long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment- specific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can neoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue and blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy. The proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies – a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to identify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific modulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic PDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating exosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation sequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen discovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of neoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of highly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill Cornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute for Advanced Study. This initiative is directly relevant to the primary objective to develop novel biomarkers and T cell antigenic targets for the successful application of immunotherapy in PDAC.

project	5U01CA224182-03	U01CA224182	10260606	2021	Optimizing Novel Immunotherapy Combinations Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment in Canine Spontaneous Osteosarcoma	Grant	Project Abstract Spontaneous canine osteosarcoma (OS) is a well-defined large animal model of human OS, exhibiting similar clinical presentation and molecular aberrations. Indeed, canine OS has historically been used to help develop novel limb spare techniques, evaluate a variety of non-specific immunotherapeutics such as L-MTP-PE, and assess the efficacy of targeted therapeutics to prevent the outgrowth of metastatic disease. Despite best efforts, progress in the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease has essentially stalled for the past 3 decades; 30% of people and 90% of dogs still die of tumor spread, primarily to the lungs. Numerous clinical trials have been undertaken in people with macroscopic metastases and in dogs with both microscopic and macroscopic disease, yet all have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes. This is particularly evident with respect to immune checkpoint inhibitors that do not induce the dramatic disease regressions typically observed in other cancers such as melanoma and lung cancer. One particularly daunting challenge for immunotherapy-based therapeutics in OS relates to the permissiveness of the tumor microenvironment (TME) for inducing anti-tumor immune responses. Our data suggests that a relatively low mutational load combined with a dampened overall immune response in OS may contribute to the observed lack of response to current treatment approaches. We propose that targeting the immune suppressive TME in OS is essential to generating potent and durable anti- tumor immunity. To accomplish this, it may be necessary to simultaneously modulate several elements in the TME, including Tregs, MDSCs, M2 macrophages and overexpressed inhibitory checkpoint molecules. In support of this, we have generated a body of data demonstrating immunological activity of multiple therapeutics, including repurposed drugs with good safety records (losartan, oclacitinib), small molecule inhibitors with established PK/PD in dogs (toceranib, RV1001, reparixin, JHU-292) and antibodies specific for checkpoint molecules (anti- PD1). However, the exact combinations that are most effective against metastatic OS have not yet been identified, and this is a major goal of this proposal. As such, we hypothesize that an adaptive pilot trial design can be used to rapidly screen TME-targeting immunotherapy drug combinations in dogs with macroscopic chemotherapy-resistant metastatic OS and that this information can be refined to assess activity of the most active approach against microscopic metastases in a subsequent adjuvant trial. This will be accomplished by testing four TME modifying immunotherapy combinations for anti-tumor and immune modulatory activity in dogs with macroscopic OS metastases, interrogating relevant biomarkers associated with responses to therapy, then using this information to conduct an adjuvant immunotherapy trial with the most active combination in dogs with microscopic metastatic OS. The data generated from this proposal will create a blueprint for future immunotherapy studies in people with OS by eliminating approaches deemed inactive and generating a set of clinical biomarkers to guide treatment.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).

project	5U01CA224348-03	U01CA224348	10251378	2021	Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy	Grant	We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan, can enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS 2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include “normalization” of cancer-associated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and decreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy – FOLFIRINOX and then chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this trial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to resectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably, transcriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only normalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity involving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the PDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in combination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive PDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs and cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had limited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover how losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood vessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug- induced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically engineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment reprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on our preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our bench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will positively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have a 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the knowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment in PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium. Through this work, we will develop innovative approaches to enhance anti-tumor immunity in this intractable disease.

Nonclassical monocytes function in circulation to aid in removing pathogens and debris from the vasculature. We recently found that nonclassical monocytes function in the vasculature to prevent tumor metastasis by orchestrating the killing and clearance of metastasizing tumor cells. The anti-tumor immune potential of nonclassical patrolling monocytes is in contrast to the growing evidence for pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic functions of myeloid cells in many tumor types. In the current proposal, we hypothesize that nonclassical monocytes function in an anti-tumoral manner to support CAR T cell expansion and efficacy in patients with solid tumors. Thus, one major goal of our proposal is to determine whether monocyte therapy using anti-tumoral nonclassical monocytes in combination with existing CAR T immunotherapy would improve efficacy. We will use mass cytometry to study monocyte subsets in cancer patients to identify new markers that will help readily determine how successful a proposed immunotherapy may be for patients. Aim 1 will identify unique markers of nonclassical monocytes in multiply relapsed sarcoma patients versus healthy subjects using mass cytometry. Aim 1 will be performed using banked samples from the existing GD2 CAR T trial at the NIH Clinical Center. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that nonclassical monocytes play a functional role in promoting anti-tumor immunity when used in combination with immunotherapy for solid tumor metastasis. Aim 2 will use both xenografted humanized mouse and syngeneic mouse tumor models. Aim 3 will study the safety and preliminary efficacy of CAR T cell immunotherapy in combination with nonclassical monocyte cell therapy for patients with multiple relapsed, metastatic or progressive pediatric solid tumors. In Aim 3, we will initiate a second generation GD2 CAR T cell trial for multiply relapsed patients with osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma. Given the potential anti-tumor efficacy of patrolling monocytes we plan to initiate an early phase clinical trial delivering nonclassical monocytes alone and in combination with CAR T cell therapy as part of this trial. There are 3 investigators in this project: one extramural, one intramural at NCI, and one at the NIH Clinical Center. From the results of this proposal, we will achieve significant insight into the roles of various myeloid cell subpopulations on promoting and inhibiting the anti-tumoral responses of CAR T cell therapies for solid tumors. We are uniquely poised as a research team to directly address the role of monocytes and other myeloid cells in interacting with CAR T cells in human patients. The findings of our research team will significantly advance the knowledge that will lead to effective CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors. As similar interactions of monocytes occur with T cells that are modulated by checkpoint inhibitor trials, we anticipate that our findings will shed insight into monocyte:T cell interactions in the context of checkpoint inhibition therapy.

LS SCLC has less than a 25% 5-year overall survival (OS) and ultimately a strategy for improving long-term SCLC outcomes needs to successfully target tumor cell populations that survive standard therapy and give rise to recurrent disease. There is, however, a considerable gap in understanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiotherapy resistance in SCLC. Our project is unique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on chemoradioresistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient- derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate mechanisms of therapy resistance. This approach was remarkably successful, identifying a tolerable and strongly synergistic anti- SCLC interaction that led to a CTEP-approved trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070; Study Chair: Hann). In this research program, we will test key hypotheses via three specific aims that will provide more mechanistic insights into the rapidly emergent chemoradiation resistance observed in LS SCLC. One central hypothesis of this proposal is that adaptive gene expression changes mediate rapid emergence of the chemoradiation resistance phenotype in LS SCLC. We have developed a novel chemoradiation treatment regimen with SCLC PDX models to facilitate these studies. Development and characterization of this novel model involves a unique collaboration between medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, bioinformaticians, medical physicists, veterinarians and molecular/cell biologists that is extremely well suited to develop an integrated program dedicated to resolving questions of SCLC chemoradioresistance. Finally, we have already identified novel gene targets that are correlated with SCLC chemoradioresistance. Our research program is organized as follows: Aim #1: Characterize natural history of response of experimental models of SCLC to chemoradiation in vivo. We will determine response rates and recurrence patterns of a panel of SCLC PDXs and transgenic mouse models. Aim #2: Characterization of molecular underpinnings of SCLC chemoradiation resistance.

project	5U01CA232758-02	U01CA232758	9789207	2019	B cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity in ovarian cancer	Grant	ABSTRACT  Within tumor beds, T and B cells often interact to form highly organized structures similar to lymph nodes, termed tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), which are associated with better outcomes in many tumors. TFH cells are crucial for the formation of germinal centers and humoral responses, and our new data show that TFH cells become the main producers of CXCL13 and TNFS14/LIGHT upon vaccination. The assembly and maintenance of TLS should be therefore dependent on TFH responses. Our new data demonstrate that Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (Satb1) ablation specifically in T cells leads to enhanced TFH differentiation and augmented Ag-specific humoral responses, which is associated with concurrent ICOS and PD-1 de-repression. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that LIGHT+CXCL13+ TFH cell formation and, subsequently, the orchestration of TLS in cancer, is governed by Satb1 silencing in CD4 T cells by both de-repressing ICOS in TFH cells and suppressing Foxp3+PD-1highCXCR5+ T follicular regulatory (TFR) cell formation through PD-1 up-regulation. Therefore, TGF-β paradoxically enhances the generation of TFH cells and the formation of TLS through Satb1 repression.  In Aim 1, we will define the role of SATB1-dependent ICOS expression during TFH differentiation. Through ChIP-PCR and functional analysis of Satb1-competent vs. Satb1- deficient T cells in vivo, we will substantiate a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby the master genomic organizer Satb1 governs ICOS expression, leading to enhanced TFH differentiation in the absence of Satb1.  In Aim 2, we will determine the role of SATB1 in TGF-β-driven, Treg-dependent TFH differentiation. Here, we will combine geentic manipulation and existing transgenic models to establish to what extent the mechanism of TGF-β-driven TFH differentiation is Satb1- and PD-1- dependent, in a manner that requires decreased TFR formation.  In Aim 3, we will recapitulate the mechanisms leading to the formation and protective activity of TLS in vivo in ovarian cancer. By leveraging unique transgenic models, our ovarian cancer- specific CAR T cells and our viable single-cell suspensions from freshly dissociated ovarian carcinomas, we will define a novel TGF-β → Satb1 silencing → TFH cell formation axis driving relevant anti-tumor humoral responses.  Our work will exert a profound effect in the field by elucidating how epigenetic programs controlled by SATB1 govern the generation of TFH cells at tumor beds in a TGF-β-dependent manner. Recapitulating these mechanisms in vivo will pave the way for more effective immunotherapies aimed to promote combined humoral and T cell responses through the orchestration of TLS in irresectable/metastatic tumors, and could lead to the identification of antibodies with anti-tumor activity spontaneously produced at tumor beds.

TFH cells are crucial for the formation of germinal centers and humoral responses, and our new data show that TFH cells become the main producers of CXCL13 and TNFS14/LIGHT upon vaccination. The assembly and maintenance of TLS should be therefore dependent on TFH responses. Our new data demonstrate that Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (Satb1) ablation specifically in T cells leads to enhanced TFH differentiation and augmented Ag-specific humoral responses, which is associated with concurrent ICOS and PD-1 de-repression. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that LIGHT+CXCL13+ TFH cell formation and, subsequently, the orchestration of TLS in cancer, is governed by Satb1 silencing in CD4 T cells by both de-repressing ICOS in TFH cells and suppressing Foxp3+PD-1highCXCR5+ T follicular regulatory (TFR) cell formation through PD-1 up-regulation. Therefore, TGF-β paradoxically enhances the generation of TFH cells and the formation of TLS through Satb1 repression.  In Aim 1, we will define the role of SATB1-dependent ICOS expression during TFH differentiation. Through ChIP-PCR and functional analysis of Satb1-competent vs. Satb1- deficient T cells in vivo, we will substantiate a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby the master genomic organizer Satb1 governs ICOS expression, leading to enhanced TFH differentiation in the absence of Satb1.  In Aim 2, we will determine the role of SATB1 in TGF-β-driven, Treg-dependent TFH differentiation. Here, we will combine geentic manipulation and existing transgenic models to establish to what extent the mechanism of TGF-β-driven TFH differentiation is Satb1- and PD-1- dependent, in a manner that requires decreased TFR formation.  In Aim 3, we will recapitulate the mechanisms leading to the formation and protective activity of TLS in vivo in ovarian cancer. By leveraging unique transgenic models, our ovarian cancer- specific CAR T cells and our viable single-cell suspensions from freshly dissociated ovarian carcinomas, we will define a novel TGF-β → Satb1 silencing → TFH cell formation axis driving relevant anti-tumor humoral responses.  Our work will exert a profound effect in the field by elucidating how epigenetic programs controlled by SATB1 govern the generation of TFH cells at tumor beds in a TGF-β-dependent manner. Recapitulating these mechanisms in vivo will pave the way for more effective immunotherapies aimed to promote combined humoral and T cell responses through the orchestration of TLS in irresectable/metastatic tumors, and could lead to the identification of antibodies with anti-tumor activity spontaneously produced at tumor beds.

Strategies to assess the genetic risk of unaffected individuals are needed. Scalable and sustainable methods to automatically extract and analyze family history information routinely captured in the electronic health record (EHR) can identify primary care patients appropriate for cancer genetic services. Increased patient ascertainment needs to be paired with implementation studies to compare models of delivering genetic services, including patient-directed models. Because access to services continues to be a barrier for those from minority racial and ethnic groups and rural areas, examining responses to different delivery models across population subgroups is essential. This study will employ an implementation science framework to test a replicable EHR-based clinical decision support (CDS) infrastructure to: (i) automatically identify unaffected patients from 48 primary care clinics in two healthcare systems, University of Utah and New York University, who qualify for cancer genetic services (Aim 1); and (ii) compare two models of genetic services delivery for 1,920 primary care patients using a randomized trial design with clinic-level randomization (Aims 2 and 3). We hypothesize that the CDS infrastructure will identify additional patients who have not been previously referred (Aim 1) and that uptake of genetic testing (Aim 2) and adherence to management recommendations (Aim 3) will be equivalent between the models. To address Aim 1, we will evaluate whether the CDS approach identifies patients who have not previously been referred, and whether this varies by race/ethnicity and rurality. To address Aim 2, we will compare: a patient-directed model in which those identified by the CDS infrastructure as meeting testing criteria will be informed of their cancer risks, provided with educational resources, and offered the option to select genetic testing through a patient portal to an enhanced standard of care model in which providers and patients are notified through CDS when criteria are met and of the availability of standard of care genetic counseling. We will compare uptake of genetic testing by model and whether this differs by race/ethnicity and rurality. In Aim 3, we will compare the effects of the two delivery models on adherence to recommendations 12 months after return of results, examining differences in effects by race/ethnicity and rurality. Innovative features include implementation of population-based CDS assessment of family history information available in the EHR; comparison of outcomes of patient-directed and enhanced standard of care delivery models; and focus on impact of race/ethnicity and rurality. This highly impactful translational research builds on our unique strengths in cancer genetics, clinical informatics, and population sciences, and addresses issues of immediate clinical significance, including increasing hereditary cancer genetic testing in appropriate patients and improving access for underserved groups.

Symptom side effects such as nausea and diarrhea are particularly common and impactful on the patient experience. However, historically this information has been reported by clinicians on behalf of their patients rather than by patients themselves – a process that has been shown to miss up to half of patients' symptoms. Therefore, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) supported development of the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), a library of questions to enable systematic patient self-reporting of side effect information. To date, the PRO-CTCAE questions have been developed and tested for validity and feasibility of use in clinical trials – work that was led by the investigators on this proposal under contracts to the NCI. However, it is not yet established how best to combine PRO-CTCAE information with traditional measures of treatment impact such as clinician-reported adverse events, time on treatment, drug dose levels, performance status, and hospitalizations. The purpose of this proposal is to advance understanding of the role of the PRO- CTCAE in combination with these traditional measures of treatment impact in assessments of drug tolerability. In this proposal, advanced statistical methods will be used to analyze data from numerous clinical trials accessible to the team through the National Clinical Trial Network (cooperative groups) and industry. The specific aims are to: 1) characterize relationships between the PRO-CTCAE and traditional measures of treatment impact and tolerability; 2) test and standardize analytic techniques for the PRO-CTCAE; 3) refine approaches to analyzing missing PRO-CTCAE data; and 4) develop and refine tabular and graphical data visualizations for longitudinal PRO-CTCAE data. To accomplish these aims, an exceptional multidisciplinary team has been assembled including scientific, clinical, and patient investigators with extensive experience in academic and industry clinical research, and longstanding expertise in patient-reported outcomes, adverse events, biostatistics, psychometrics, clinical trial design/analysis, health disparities, and informatics. This team has successfully led multiple prior national research consortia. The team will work collaboratively and flexibly with other investigators and stakeholders through the planned U01 consortium, and will share data, statistical programming code, and ideas freely. This work is intended to inform best practices for tabulating and reporting PRO-CTCAE data, and will enable more systematic and patient-centered evaluations of tolerability in cancer clinical trials.

To date, the PRO-CTCAE questions have been developed and tested for validity and feasibility of use in clinical trials – work that was led by the investigators on this proposal under contracts to the NCI. However, it is not yet established how best to combine PRO-CTCAE information with traditional measures of treatment impact such as clinician-reported adverse events, time on treatment, drug dose levels, performance status, and hospitalizations. The purpose of this proposal is to advance understanding of the role of the PRO- CTCAE in combination with these traditional measures of treatment impact in assessments of drug tolerability. In this proposal, advanced statistical methods will be used to analyze data from numerous clinical trials accessible to the team through the National Clinical Trial Network (cooperative groups) and industry. The specific aims are to: 1) characterize relationships between the PRO-CTCAE and traditional measures of treatment impact and tolerability; 2) test and standardize analytic techniques for the PRO-CTCAE; 3) refine approaches to analyzing missing PRO-CTCAE data; and 4) develop and refine tabular and graphical data visualizations for longitudinal PRO-CTCAE data. To accomplish these aims, an exceptional multidisciplinary team has been assembled including scientific, clinical, and patient investigators with extensive experience in academic and industry clinical research, and longstanding expertise in patient-reported outcomes, adverse events, biostatistics, psychometrics, clinical trial design/analysis, health disparities, and informatics. This team has successfully led multiple prior national research consortia. The team will work collaboratively and flexibly with other investigators and stakeholders through the planned U01 consortium, and will share data, statistical programming code, and ideas freely. This work is intended to inform best practices for tabulating and reporting PRO-CTCAE data, and will enable more systematic and patient-centered evaluations of tolerability in cancer clinical trials.

Germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, primarily MLH1 and MSH2, cause deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) and LS. LS CRCs have exceptionally high numbers of small insertion/deletion frameshift and missense mutations. Elevated dMMR mutation rates cause some mutations to recurrently arise in tumors from different patients. For example, the human TGFβR2 gene has a poly(A) coding repeat, and the same “shared” frameshift mutation is recurrently identified in >60% of LS dMMR CRCs. Here, we will use state of the art tools to systematically delineate recurrent LS mouse and human pre-malignant neoantigens, test whether vaccination with frequently mutated “shared” immunogenic neoantigens reduces LS mouse CRC penetrance, and elucidate adaptive immune mechanisms for CRC immunoprevention. In Aim 1 we will comprehensively delineate frequently mutated recurrent neoantigens in Lynch syndrome mouse colorectal mucosa and adenomas. This will provide insights into pre-malignant colon dMMR immunoediting mechanisms, the timing and sequence of dMMR neoantigen appearance, and systematically delineate the most immunogenic recurrent shared dMMR neoantigen vaccine targets for LS mouse CRC immunoprevention. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome mismatch repair deficient epithelial cells in colon mucosa. This will give insights into the mechanism of dMMR colon mucosal immunoediting, and test the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent neoantigen vaccine strategy using the earliest neoantigen mutations for LS immunoprevention. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome colorectal tumor burden. This will evaluate the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent adenoma neoantigen vaccine strategy for Lynch syndrome immunoprevention and provide insights into the mechanisms of dMMR immunoediting. Finally, in Aim 4 we will systematically delineate Lynch syndrome patient adenoma recurrent neoantigens. This will delineate the most promising candidate recurrent neoantigens that can be used for LS patient tumor vaccine clinical trials and give insights into dMMR immunoediting mechanisms.

Small cell carcinomas arise from many different epithelial tissues but are generally aggressive, have no curative treatment, and carry a dire prognosis. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most common subtype. Small cell prostate cancer (SCPC) is rare as a primary disease but is becoming increasingly common as a late-stage phenotypic transition in response to hormone-deprivation therapy. Emerging research indicates that despite their disparate tissues of origin, SCPC and SCLC are highly similar in behavior and molecular phenotype. This suggests effective targeted therapies could address both malignancies.  Our strategy is to define cancer-specific epitopes created by alternative pre-mRNA splicing in small cell carcinomas and then use these targets to develop TCR-based therapeutics. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies targeting cell surface proteins have been developed for some hematological malignancies, but this strategy has been unsuccessful for epithelial tumors. The limited cancer specificity of the target epitope has led to significant on-target, off-tumor toxicities in human trials. We have chosen to pursue TCRs to expand the pool of available targets beyond the cell surface. We hypothesize that tapping into the additional proteomic diversity revealed by a detailed analysis of alternatively spliced exons will provide better targets.  Our team of principal investigators includes experts in the computational biology of alternative splicing (Yi Xing), cancer cell biology and immunology (Owen Witte), and hematopoietic cell development and immunology (Gay Crooks). We are compiling RNA-Seq data on small cell cancers and normal tissues from public datasets and new human cell line models of SCPC & SCLC derived from benign cells by lentiviral transduction. This combined dataset serves as the foundation for our discovery effort. We plan to pair this with total proteomics analysis to identify spliced isoforms that affect protein composition. This data will be further integrated with immunopeptidomics assays that define the pool of peptides presented to the immune system by the target cancer cells. Epitopes derived from alternative splicing events that show high cancer specificity, protein expression, and predicted or observed epitope presentation will be prioritized for TCR development. We will use these epitopes to select TCRs from naïve human T-cell populations using a highly organotypic in vitro artificial human thymic culture system developed in the Crooks laboratory.

project	5U01CA233078-02	U01CA233078	9789858	2019	N-glycosylation and Immunotherapy for cancer	Grant	Project Summary For decades, the treatment of cancer has relied on surgical resection, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Recently, a number of immune based therapies have provided promising new approaches for cancer treatment. These include checkpoint inhibitors that block T cell suppression (eg anti-PD-1), bi-specific antibodies that cross-link T cells to cancer cells (eg Bi-specific T cell engagers – BiTE) and T cells engineered to express antigen receptors specific to cancer cells (eg Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells or CAR T). All three approaches induce T cell mediated killing of cancer cells. However, widespread development of bi-specific antibodies and CAR T cells is limited by the small number of known cell-surface proteins that are sufficiently specific to cancer to safely allow targeting by antibodies. This is particularly true for solid cancers, where unlike hematopoietic malignancies, loss of healthy cells cannot be readily replenished by stem cell progenitors. A solution to this issue is to target cancer specific glycan antigens rather than protein antigens. Indeed, altered glycosylation is a near universal feature of cancer and represent the most abundant and widely expressed cell surface cancer antigens, while also having limited or no expression in normal tissue. However, generation of monoclonal antibodies specific to complex carbohydrates has proven to be very challenging, greatly limiting their usefulness as targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we propose to address these issues and develop a novel class of immunotherapeutics that target an N-linked carbohydrate antigen common to the vast majority of solid and hematopoietic cancers. We have termed these molecules as Glycan- dependent T cell Recruiter (GlyTR) technology. Critically, GlyTR technology does not utilize antibodies to target carbohydrate cancer antigens. Preliminary data demonstrates that the GlyTR bi-specific protein 1) specifically bound to both human CD3 and its N-glycan target, 2) robustly activated T cells only in the presence of cancer cells, 3) induced T cell dependent killing of cancer cells with an EC50 as low as 5pM, 4) inhibited in vivo growth of established colon cancer xenografts in humanized NSG mice and 5) did not trigger production of antibodies in mice. To further expand on this approach, the following Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will characterize human and mouse reactive GlyTR bi-specific proteins targeting N-glycans. Aim 2 will examine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using humanized NSG mice.

Recently, a number of immune based therapies have provided promising new approaches for cancer treatment. These include checkpoint inhibitors that block T cell suppression (eg anti-PD-1), bi-specific antibodies that cross-link T cells to cancer cells (eg Bi-specific T cell engagers – BiTE) and T cells engineered to express antigen receptors specific to cancer cells (eg Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells or CAR T). All three approaches induce T cell mediated killing of cancer cells. However, widespread development of bi-specific antibodies and CAR T cells is limited by the small number of known cell-surface proteins that are sufficiently specific to cancer to safely allow targeting by antibodies. This is particularly true for solid cancers, where unlike hematopoietic malignancies, loss of healthy cells cannot be readily replenished by stem cell progenitors. A solution to this issue is to target cancer specific glycan antigens rather than protein antigens. Indeed, altered glycosylation is a near universal feature of cancer and represent the most abundant and widely expressed cell surface cancer antigens, while also having limited or no expression in normal tissue. However, generation of monoclonal antibodies specific to complex carbohydrates has proven to be very challenging, greatly limiting their usefulness as targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we propose to address these issues and develop a novel class of immunotherapeutics that target an N-linked carbohydrate antigen common to the vast majority of solid and hematopoietic cancers. We have termed these molecules as Glycan- dependent T cell Recruiter (GlyTR) technology. Critically, GlyTR technology does not utilize antibodies to target carbohydrate cancer antigens. Preliminary data demonstrates that the GlyTR bi-specific protein 1) specifically bound to both human CD3 and its N-glycan target, 2) robustly activated T cells only in the presence of cancer cells, 3) induced T cell dependent killing of cancer cells with an EC50 as low as 5pM, 4) inhibited in vivo growth of established colon cancer xenografts in humanized NSG mice and 5) did not trigger production of antibodies in mice. To further expand on this approach, the following Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will characterize human and mouse reactive GlyTR bi-specific proteins targeting N-glycans. Aim 2 will examine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using humanized NSG mice. Aim 3 will examine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using mice with a normal immune system.

However, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been limited by low response rates and limited durations of response in certain settings, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), as well as ovarian, prostate and colorectal cancers. These findings are explained, at least in part, by the premise that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is only one of a number of tumor immune suppressive mechanisms that require inhibition.  Therefore, additional strategies are clearly needed to improve the immunotherapy of human cancers. In this respect, cancer cells activate a program of immune evasion involving, for example, induction of PD-L1 expression and the downregulation of effectors that promote innate and adaptive immune response. The discovery and targeting of such immune suppressive programs has had limited success to date, supporting a critical need for identifying signaling pathways that activate these programs.  The MUC1-C oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in human carcinomas and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. MUC1-C promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the cancer stem cell (CSC) state. Recent advances have demonstrated that MUC1-C also activates a program of immune evasion in human cancer cells that includes upregulation of PD-L1 expression and the suppression of immune effectors, such as IFN. In addition, targeting MUC1-C has been found to effectively reverse tumor immune evasion.  These findings have emphasized the need for developing agents that target MUC1-C for the immunotherapy of human cancers. In this way, selective and potent antibodies generated against the MUC1-C extracellular domain are under development as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and for antibody- dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, a peptide inhibitor of the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain has been developed in a nanoparticle formulation, based on the findings that this agent inhibits PD-L1 expression and activates anti-tumor T cells in the immune microenvironment.  The MUC1-C-targeted agents will be studied in genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for anti-tumor activity, as well as effects on the immune microenvironment when used alone and in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade. These studies will be integrated with assessment of MUC1-C expression in human tumors as a metric of the suppressive immune microenvironment. The overall goal will be to develop agents that target MUC1-C and are advanced to clinical evaluation as novel immunotherapeutics.

However, the therapeutic potential of the immune system in eliminating premalignant cells and preventing their progression to invasive cancers is unclear. To determine the benefit of activating the immune system to prevent cancer development and recurrence, we study the immune pathways that lead to effective immune activation against early phases of breast cancer development. Breast cancer is the most common internal cancer and second cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Importantly, the individuals at high risk of developing breast cancer due to underlying genetic mutations and those with premalignant lesions can be clinically identified and treated. Therefore, discovering an effective approach to activate the patients' own immune system against early breast precursor lesions may yield a lasting memory that can prevent breast cancer development and recurrence in this high-risk population. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a skin-derived immune factor called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) suppresses the early stages of skin and breast cancer development. We have been able to extend these finding to clinics through a randomized double-blind clinical trial in which we find TSLP induction to promote a robust immune activation against skin cancer precursors and their complete clearance. In order to determine the precise mechanism of TSLP-induced immune response against early premalignant cells in the breast, and to extend our findings to other similar immune factors in high-risk patients, we aim to (1) determine the immune cells and signals that target breast premalignant cells in response to TSLP, (2) investigate the role of other immune factors released by breast cells that can induce immune response to block breast cancer development, and (3) determine the factors that are driving the immune response in the breast glands of patients with genetic mutations and utilize them for induction of an optimal immune response against early breast cancer. The outcomes of the proposed research will establish a foundation for the use of the immune system in blocking breast cancer development and provide novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer immunoprevention.

Importantly, the individuals at high risk of developing breast cancer due to underlying genetic mutations and those with premalignant lesions can be clinically identified and treated. Therefore, discovering an effective approach to activate the patients' own immune system against early breast precursor lesions may yield a lasting memory that can prevent breast cancer development and recurrence in this high-risk population. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a skin-derived immune factor called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) suppresses the early stages of skin and breast cancer development. We have been able to extend these finding to clinics through a randomized double-blind clinical trial in which we find TSLP induction to promote a robust immune activation against skin cancer precursors and their complete clearance. In order to determine the precise mechanism of TSLP-induced immune response against early premalignant cells in the breast, and to extend our findings to other similar immune factors in high-risk patients, we aim to (1) determine the immune cells and signals that target breast premalignant cells in response to TSLP, (2) investigate the role of other immune factors released by breast cells that can induce immune response to block breast cancer development, and (3) determine the factors that are driving the immune response in the breast glands of patients with genetic mutations and utilize them for induction of an optimal immune response against early breast cancer. The outcomes of the proposed research will establish a foundation for the use of the immune system in blocking breast cancer development and provide novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer immunoprevention.

Advances in immunotherapy with drugs targeting immune checkpoints have raised hopes that these agents will improve outcomes for mCRPC patients. While initial studies of immune checkpoint blockade have been unsuccessful, emerging evidence suggests a subset of prostate cancer (PCa) patients can respond, although the mechanisms of PCa immunotherapy response and resistance are incompletely characterized. Work in other immunotherapy responsive malignancies has found several predictive immune and tumor-intrinsic properties that contribute to response, but the extent to which these (or other) features are operant in PCa is largely unknown. For example, we recently identified mutations in a chromatin remodeling complex that mediates immunotherapy response through T cell interactions in solid tumors, and in parallel discovered a previously unknown PCa genomic subclass defined by mutations in these same chromatin remodelers. These findings indicate that tumor-intrinsic epigenetic dysregulation may also interact with the immune system to modulate PCa immunotherapy responsiveness. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that multiple immune and tumor- intrinsic properties mediate PCa interactions with the immune system, and these interactions can be modified through selective targeting in combination with checkpoint blockade to expand the therapeutic potential of immunotherapy in PCa. We will leverage our team's deep experience in clinically grounded molecular characterization and preclinical models that can test immunotherapy combinations in PCa to define the processes that govern the immunotherapy landscape in PCa. The proposed specific aims are: 1) Define the systemic and infiltrating immune states in PCa associated with clinical response to checkpoint blockade; 2) Establish the immunologic impact of chromatin dysregulation and inhibition in PCa; and 3) Determine the impact of existing DNA damaging agents for sensitizing PCa to PD-1 blockade. This proposal leverages the extensive, novel, and complementary resources at both Dana-Farber/Broad Institute and University of California, San Francisco, led by highly collaborative investigators and an international scientific team, to address the hypotheses outlined herein. Through a combination of functional, molecular, and clinical approaches inherent in these studies, our team is poised to identify mCRPC cohorts that may benefit from this treatment paradigm, determine strategies to augment the use of checkpoint inhibitors in this disease, and mechanistically define the immune and tumor-intrinsic defects that drive immunoresistance in PCa. Broadly, this project will provide a unique approach for the Immuno-Oncology Translation Network (IOTN) community and enable discovery of anti-cancer immunotherapies strategies for PCa that may have larger relevance across the IOTN network and collaborating members of the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.

Using an “in situ vaccine” regimen consisting of 12 Gy focal external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and intratumoral (IT) injection of tumor-specific antibody (mAb) + IL2, we have eradicated solitary, large, cold syngeneic tumors in mice. This in situ vaccine converts the targeted tumor into a focus of enhanced tumor antigen presentation resulting in increased T-cell infiltration and potent T-cell memory. However, the presence of an identical but untreated second tumor (2°) on a mouse’s opposite flank inhibits the effect of this treatment, preventing eradication of the primary (1°) tumor treated with EBRT + IT mAb-IL2. In this setting, the untreated 2° tumor causes tumor- specific immune unresponsiveness to EBRT + IT mAb-IL2 at the 1° tumor. We refer to this as concomitant immune tolerance (CIT). We can overcome CIT, and eliminate both tumors by giving IT mAb-IL2 to the 1° tumor and EBRT to both the 1° and 2° tumors. Delivering as little as 2 Gy EBRT to the 2° tumor can overcome CIT. Clinically, delivery of EBRT (even low dose) to all sites of metastatic disease is problematic, but this can effectively be achieved using molecular targeted radiation therapy (MTRT). MTRT is increasingly entering clinical oncology practice and our UW team has led preclinical and clinical testing of a novel class of MTRT using alkylphosphocholine (APCh) analogs that selectively deliver radiation to cancers in vivo. These show tumor-selective uptake in virtually all mammalian tumor cells and tumor locations tested (including > 90 tumor lines and in patients across various clinical trials). In a syngeneic murine melanoma model, we have observed a potent synergy between systemically administered ICI and MTRT delivered using our next-generation APC analog, 90Y-NM600. In a project that builds upon the ongoing collaborative progress of our multidisciplinary team, we will now systematically optimize the potency of combining MTRT with immunotherapy to enhance the immune response against immunologically cold tumors. In murine models, we will: 1) expand on preliminary data showing potent synergy with the combination of MTRT and ICI, 2) evaluate the capacity of MTRT to overcome CIT and enhance systemic anti-tumor immune response in the setting of multiple tumors where one is treated with in situ vaccine (EBRT + IT mAb-IL2) alone or in combination with ICI. Because murine models do not replicate the size and spatial distribution of human metastatic cancer and because these factors strongly influence the dosimetry of MTRT, we will test the immunomodulatory effects of MTRT + in situ vaccine in large breed companion canines (pet dogs) with naturally occurring metastatic melanoma. The insights and treatment regimens developed in these studies should enable rapid translation to clinical testing in patients and potentially for any type of metastatic cancer.	90Y;Address;Anatomy;Animals;Antibodies;Antigen Presentation;Biology;Cancer Model;Canis familiaris;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Companions;Data;Disease;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Distant;Dose;Epitope spreading;External Beam Radiation Therapy;Generations;Goals;Half-Life;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Human;IL2 gene;Image;Immune;Immune Evasion;Immune Tolerance;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immunocompetent;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Injections;Intravenous;Isotopes;Length;Location;Low Dose Radiation;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metastatic Melanoma;Modality;Modeling;Molecular Target;Monoclonal Antibodies;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Mus;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Preclinical Testing;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radioisotopes;Regimen;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Safety;Site;Soft tissue sarcoma;Spatial Distribution;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Targeted Radiotherapy;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Translations;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Immunity;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Ursidae Family;Vaccination;Vaccines;Veins;Vision;Work;analog;anti-tumor immune response;cancer site;checkpoint inhibition;dosimetry;efficacy testing;immunogenic;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;insight;mRNA Expression;melanoma;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoantigens;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;novel strategies;pre-clinical;prevent;protein expression;radiation delivery;radiation effect;research clinical testing;response;sarcoma;synergism;systemic toxicity;treatment effect;tumor;tumor eradication;tumor microenvironment;uptake;virtual	UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON	MADISON	WI	UNITED STATES	Zachary Scott Morris,JAMEY P WEICHERT	DCTD	Mansoor M Ahmed	765000	$750k to $999k	765000	3-Sep-2019	18-Sep-2018	31-Aug-2023	RFA-CA-17-045	Moonshot

The growing population of older patients remains underrepresented in research that sets cancer care standards leading to significant disparities in outcomes. In our preliminary research, we found that: 1) close to 60% of older patients develop grade 3-5 toxicity (as measured by NCI's CTCAE) within three months of starting a new treatment regimen; items from geriatric assessment (GA) were significantly associated with toxicity; 2) older patients with advanced cancer frequently experience multiple symptoms that interfere with function and quality of life (QoL); and 3) older patients often experience toxicities that lead to early discontinuation of treatment, hospitalizations, and mortality. We have an unprecedented opportunity to leverage an existing multi-site cluster randomized study that is currently enrolling adults aged >70 years with age-related conditions who are starting a new treatment regimen for advanced cancer in the UR NCORP network (URCC 13059/“GAP”) (n=700). In addition to clinician-rated CTCAE, GAP captures PRO measures (PRO-CTCAE, GA, satisfaction) at baseline, 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after the start of the new treatment regimen. Extensive data are collected on clinical tolerability metrics including treatment dose modifications, hospitalizations, and mortality. We will collaborate with the U01 consortium to: 1) develop and compare the trajectories of PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades 2-5 in older patients with age-related conditions; 2) evaluate associations between PRO- CTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with clinical tolerability metrics; 3) evaluate associations between PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with PRO endpoints (e.g., function, QoL, satisfaction); and 4) validate a model that identifies older patients with age-related conditions who are at high risk for poor tolerability from treatment for advanced cancer. Developed with stakeholders, our operational definition of tolerability is novel; it includes both clinical outcomes and PRO endpoints. The team, which includes expertise in clinical trials (Mohile, Morrow, Janelsins, Kamen), biostatistics and data science (Culakova, Heckler, Pandya, Ramsdale, Zand), PRO measurement (Mohile, Duberstein, Chapman, Flannery), and collaborations with CARG (Hurria, Dale) and patient advocates (SCOREBoard led by Canin) is uniquely suited to conduct this research. This research will address a critical gap in knowledge of how patient-reported toxicity informs tolerability of treatment in older patients with advanced cancer and age-related conditions.

These methods will harness the potential of the patient-reported outcomes version of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAETM) to provide previously unavailable patient perspectives on the tolerability of treatments (including targeted agents, immunotherapies, and other evolving treatments for which the type, severity, timing, and trajectory of adverse events is less known). Such information will help providers better identify and support patients at risk for treatment discontinuation, dose reductions, and treatment delays. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) perform longitudinal analyses of CTCAE and PRO-CTCAE data from trials conducted within the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, using traditional and innovative strategies to examine AE trajectories and to produce a new reporting standard that reflects severity and fluctuations over time; 2) examine PRO-CTCAE and CTCAE predictors of treatment adherence and discontinuation; and 3) validate the broader predictive value of GP5, a single item from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) shown to predict early treatment discontinuation among women with breast cancer taking aromatase inhibitors. The study will also explore two novel measurement models for PRO-CTCAE scores and CTCAE grades: a phenotypic model including co-occurrence of symptoms and a cumulative burden index (CBI) for characterizing the quantity of burden accumulated by patients over time. Analyses will include demographic factors and insurance status to identify potential disparities.

project	5U01CA239258-02	U01CA239258	9788348	2019	Enhancing cell therapy for brain tumors	Grant	ABSTRACT Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain cancer, with standard treatments based on surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy promoting an overall survival of approximately 15 months. This has led to a resurgence of interest in immune-based approaches. While augmenting immunity has been successful in other malignancies like melanoma and leukemia/lymphoma, their efficacy in treatment of brain tumors has been very limited. Tumor antigen heterogeneity, limited number of infiltrating lymphocytes at the tumor site, and failure of checkpoint inhibitor drugs to cross the blood brain barrier all represent major obstacles to effective immune-therapies in GBM. Altered immunity in patients with GBM further contributes to the poor prognoses of these tumors and their relative resistance to vaccine and checkpoint inhibitors. Utilizing healthy donor immune cells in the form of adoptive cell therapy may offer a more effective alternative. However, limited information is available on the properties of effector populations that would exert effective anti-tumor activity in the brain. Pioneering work by Dr. Rick Jones at Johns Hopkins University utilizing haploidentical donor transplant (haplo-BMT) for brain tumors offers an opportunity to test kinetics of infused healthy donor immune cells in this patient population, providing a glimpse of what donor immune cells can do against brain tumors. Previous experiences with haplo-BMT suggest that effector cells of the innate immunity – natural killer cells (NKs) and invariant natural killer T cells (iNKTs) – mediate anti-tumor activity with decreased frequency of relapse. Innate immune cells are also potentially advantageous in the brain tumor setting, which affords very little tolerance for the adverse events associated with (for example) CD19-CAR T cell based-therapies. Finally, both iNKT and NK cells can actively migrate to the site of GBM following the CCL2 gradient, the chemokine released by tumor cells and the surrounding tumor associated macrophages (TAM). Dr. Savoldo at University of North Carolina has unique expertise in the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transduced T cells and iNKT cells and Dr. Bollard at Children's National has extensive experience with the genetically modified T cells and NK cells. Hence, in this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that nontolerized innate immune cells (NKs and iNKTs) derived from healthy donors will promote anti- tumor immunity in patients GBM, and may be developed as effective cellular therapies. This overarching hypothesis will be tested in 3 Specific Aims where Dr. Jones (Aim 1) will compare the cellular signatures of iNKTs and NK cells isolated from healthy donors versus patients with GBM. In Aim 2, Dr. Savoldo and the UNC team will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of healthy donor iNKT and NK cells modified to express an anti- B7H3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and in Aim 3, Drs. Bollard and Cruz at CNMC overcome the inhibitory tumor microenvironment in GBM by targeting immune suppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and TGFβ.

Pioneering work by Dr. Rick Jones at Johns Hopkins University utilizing haploidentical donor transplant (haplo-BMT) for brain tumors offers an opportunity to test kinetics of infused healthy donor immune cells in this patient population, providing a glimpse of what donor immune cells can do against brain tumors. Previous experiences with haplo-BMT suggest that effector cells of the innate immunity – natural killer cells (NKs) and invariant natural killer T cells (iNKTs) – mediate anti-tumor activity with decreased frequency of relapse. Innate immune cells are also potentially advantageous in the brain tumor setting, which affords very little tolerance for the adverse events associated with (for example) CD19-CAR T cell based-therapies. Finally, both iNKT and NK cells can actively migrate to the site of GBM following the CCL2 gradient, the chemokine released by tumor cells and the surrounding tumor associated macrophages (TAM). Dr. Savoldo at University of North Carolina has unique expertise in the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transduced T cells and iNKT cells and Dr. Bollard at Children's National has extensive experience with the genetically modified T cells and NK cells. Hence, in this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that nontolerized innate immune cells (NKs and iNKTs) derived from healthy donors will promote anti- tumor immunity in patients GBM, and may be developed as effective cellular therapies. This overarching hypothesis will be tested in 3 Specific Aims where Dr. Jones (Aim 1) will compare the cellular signatures of iNKTs and NK cells isolated from healthy donors versus patients with GBM. In Aim 2, Dr. Savoldo and the UNC team will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of healthy donor iNKT and NK cells modified to express an anti- B7H3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and in Aim 3, Drs. Bollard and Cruz at CNMC overcome the inhibitory tumor microenvironment in GBM by targeting immune suppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and TGFβ.

Traditional germline genetic testing models, which include in-depth genetic counseling both before and after testing, are time intensive and place substantial demands on the limited genetic counselor workforce. A “mainstreaming” model, which allows for non-genetics healthcare providers to order genetic testing without pre-test genetic counseling, with support from genetic counselors at the time of result disclosure, has shown promise. Yet, past evaluations of mainstreaming models have been hampered by serious limitations: Studies were restricted to the context of BRCA1/2 testing and do not reflect the growing use of multigene panel testing (MGPT); rarely used rigorous experimental study designs or evaluated theoretically-relevant decision-making, psychosocial, and communication outcomes; have not capitalized on opportunities to improve post-test clinical and familial communication; and neither included nor addressed informational needs of minority and medically underserved patients. We overcome these limitations with the proposed study, the objective of which is to develop, test, and evaluate a linguistically and culturally appropriate mainstreaming (LCAM) model for hereditary cancer MGPT among cancer patients diverse in race/ethnicity, language, and education. We will first use formative research methods, including transcreation and cognitive interviewing, to adapt existing pre-test educational materials and post-test clinical communication materials for use among the diverse population treated at our community hospital partnering sites (Kings County Hospital Center, Queens Cancer Center). Next, we will conduct an RCT involving English, Haitian Creole, or Spanish-speaking patients diagnosed with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer (N=500). Patients will be randomized to obtain access to cancer MGPT through either: i) standard-of-care wherein in- depth pre-test and post-test genetic counseling are provided via telegenetics (i.e., videoconferencing delivered at the site clinic) with standard post-test clinical communication materials, or ii) LCAM intervention wherein patients receive the adapted pre-test educational materials with testing ordered by their oncologist, followed by post-test genetic counseling provided via telephone with adapted clinical communication materials. Patients will complete assessments of decision-making, psychosocial, and behavioral outcomes at baseline, upon deciding whether to have MGPT, and at 1-week and 6-months following receipt of their test results. Long-term engagement among patients who receive a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) result will also be explored one year after result receipt through uptake of an offer to discuss any changes in cancer risk or variant reclassification and an additional assessment. This research has the potential to transform genetic counseling and testing practice by promoting effective risk communication, decision making, and more equitable delivery of genomic medicine to those at risk of hereditary cancer syndromes.

Hereditary cancer syndromes are more common than previously appreciated, and genetic testing is standard of care to establish these diagnoses. Genetic test results are also critical to guiding targeted therapies in patients with established tumors such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Genetic counselors have traditionally managed the testing process, but there is a critical shortage of counselors and they are not able to meet the demand for testing. Without a genetic counselor, effective communication of testing options, outcomes, and risks could be compromised. One of the most challenging decisions is the choice of gene panel. Multi- gene panels are now the norm, but panels can include as few as 5 or as many as 125 genes. Panels can include genes associated with a single tumor type or multiple tumor types, and genes with weaker evidence for pathogenicity may also be included. There is no consensus on what constitutes an ideal panel, and the choice of panel is therefore highly individualized. Innovative strategies to support patients facing these time-sensitive and complex pre-test decisions are needed. Decision aids are well-suited to address this challenge by providing education, facilitating the process of informed choice, clarifying personal preferences, and promoting shared decision making. We propose to develop an electronic decision aid to assist individuals in choosing a multi-gene panel with their medical oncologist instead of a genetic counselor. We will test the hypothesis that a decision aid without a genetic counselor can facilitate quality decisions around the selection of a specific multi-gene panel. In addition to positive changes in knowledge, shared decision making, and decisional conflict, we anticipate that the decision aid will increase access to genetic testing in a timely manner. Utilizing an effectiveness- implementation hybrid study design, we propose these specific aims: (1) To develop and pilot electronic decision aids for selection of a multi-gene panel in ovarian and pancreatic cancer patients. (2) To evaluate the efficacy of the decision aid with an oncologist versus a traditional genetic counselor session for multi- gene panel testing in a randomized clinical trial at multiple institutions. (3) To evaluate the effectiveness of implementation of the decision aid in multiple, diverse populations. These decision aids will establish a much needed and new paradigm for quality decision making and communication around multi-gene panel testing for inherited cancer syndromes. This format will uniquely address the current barriers that include the complex decision of which multi-gene panel to select, limited genetic counselor resources, and lack of time and expertise on the part of practicing oncologists.

Yet, access to genetic specialists is limited in many areas in the US, and <20% of eligible patients with a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer complete genetic testing. Thus, there is an urgent need to consider alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of genetic testing, while maintaining adequate patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes. Our research has shown that providing remote services increases uptake of genetic testing in community practices increases uptake of genetic testing. Preliminary data from our ongoing NIH-funded RESPECT study has revealed high interest in a web-based eHealth alternative to traditional pre-test counseling and no significant no differences in pre- and post-disclosure outcomes when the web-based eHealth intervention is utilized as compared to participants who received traditional pre-test genetic counselor. To address the clinically significant need for alternative delivery models to increase access and uptake of cancer genetic testing, while maintaining adequate patient cognitive, affective and behavioral outcomes, we propose to recruit a nationally diverse “real- world” sample of 1000 patients who have access barriers to genetic testing and to conduct a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate web-based eHealth delivery alternatives for genetic education and testing. We hypothesize that our theoretically and stakeholder informed eHealth delivery alternatives can provide equal or better uptake of testing and outcomes of genetic testing as compared to the traditional model of pre- and post-test counseling with a genetic counselor. We will partner with several cancer advocacy groups (ASCO, breastcancer.org, Cancer Support Community, Pennsylvania Prostate Cancer Coalition) to recruit patients to this randomized non-inferiority study using a modified 2x2 design (Aims 1-2). In Arm 1, traditional pre-test (visit 1) and post-test (visit 2: disclosure) counseling will be provided remotely through the national Penn Telegenetics Program and compared to delivery arms where patients can complete pre-test and/or disclosure of results through a self-directed web-based eHealth intervention, either in place of, or as an adjunct to traditional genetic counseling. Concurrently, we will conduct a CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research)-informed process evaluation to understand moderators of intervention usage and patient outcomes and facilitators and barriers to future implementation and sustainability of this novel eHealth alternative delivery model for genetic services both within and beyond cancer care (Aim 3). We hypothesize that a rigorously developed theoretically and stake-holder informed eHealth delivery alternative provided through a centralized Telegenetics Program has the potential to provide equal or improved patient outcomes, while reducing genetic provider time and providing access to services in community practices where access to genetic services has been limited, providing opportunities to realize the promise of precision medicine in oncology.

Radiotherapy is a proven curative therapeutic tool in the treatment of primary brain tumors. However, cranial RT results in significant cognitive morbidity. The mechanisms of radiation-induced injury result in a picture that is a combination of the small vessel disease seen with vascular dementia as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s dementia. Ischemia and injury can induce excessive NMDA stimulation and lead to excitotoxicity, and pre- clinical data suggests that selective blocking of the NMDA receptor can restore long-term potentiation and restore learning in both models of ischemia as well as models of radiation injury. Memantine is a non- competitive, low-affinity, open- channel NMDA blocker, which has been shown to be neuroprotective in pre- clinical models. In two placebo- controlled phase III trials, memantine proved to be effective treatment for Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, especially for patients with small-vessel disease. Memantine has also proven effective in reducing cognitive dysfunction in adults receiving whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases. Memantine delayed time to cognitive decline and reduced the rate of decline in memory, executive function and processing speed. Importantly, cognitive function in patients receiving memantine remained stable even after memantine was discontinued; suggesting memantine had a protective effect rather than simply a therapeutic effect. In this study, we propose evaluating the efficacy of memantine in preventing cognitive dysfunction in pediatric patients receiving cranial radiation through the clinical trial mechanism of the Children’s Oncology Group. This study is novel in that children will undergo early cognitive evaluations (baseline prior to radiation, 3, 6, and 12 months post-radiation) with a brief computerized testing battery that we will correlate with formal cognitive testing as well with long-term cognitive function (30 and 60 months) assessed with both methods. If successful, this study will provide validated early cognitive assessment time points that correlate with late cognitive toxicity and result in an framework for accelerated study design that will allow for early assessment of efficacy for future neuro-protectant trials. Dose- and volume-dependent reduction in brain volume is seen after radiotherapy exposure and is associated with cognitive decline. We hypothesize that neuroprotection with memantine will also preserve relevant brain volume and this will correlate with domain- specific improvements in cognitive function. We will use quantitative volumetric MRI analysis to correlate protective effects of memantine with brain substructure (white matter, hippocampus, frontal lobes etc) volume changes over time and correlate with cognitive assessments. Radiographic analysis will provide proof-of- principle for the mechanism of action of memantine as well as a biomarker that can be utilized in future trials of radio-protectants, which is especially important for young patients or patients not neurologically capable of completing cognitive assessments but who may benefit the most from neuroprotective interventions.

The SyMon-SAYS will administer, score, interpret and display the results of symptom assessments in “real-time” between clinic visits in cancer care ambulatory settings, when patients are likely to be more symptomatic. We hypothesize that this system can facilitate prompt identification of problematic symptoms; consequently, with the availability of graphical symptom reports over time, timely providers’ clinical care, and an informative symptom management booklet, patients will become informed about their condition and take an active role in treatment, which will further improve self-management skills. Better self-management promotes adherence to treatment plans, builds individual capacity, improves interaction between patients and caregivers, reduces the use of medical specialists, and optimizes clinical outcomes across the lifespan throughout the treatment and disease continua. The proposed waitlist control randomized trial is based on our preliminary study testing the feasibility of the patient-centered SyMon-SAYS in a pediatric oncology clinic. Results showed that the SyMon-SAYS was acceptable to patients/parents and they were willing to use it during their routine clinical care. Clinicians expressed interest in receiving reports yet preferred to review them in the medical record. Based on what we learned from this pilot, we now propose to integrate the SyMon-SAYS system into the electronic health record (EHR), to streamline the alert notification with clinician workflow by using EHR (Epic) messaging, and to include a broader range of symptoms. Patients and parents will complete the weekly symptom assessment and review the symptom report by logging into the Epic MyChart patient portal. Instead of using a standalone SyMon-SAYS app, we will align the SyMon-SAYS program with the Epic EHR. We plan to conduct a single institution modified waitlist control randomized trial of 200 children (ages 8-17) with cancer over 16 weeks (Group A: 16-week SyMon-SAYS intervention; Group B: 8-week usual care and then 8-week SyMon-SAYS intervention) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) evaluate effectiveness of SyMon-SAYS at week-8 and its maintenance effects at week-16. We hypothesize that Group A (versus Group B) will report decreased parent-perceived barriers to managing their children’s symptoms, decreased patient symptom burden, increased patient and parent self-efficacy, and ultimately increased patient HRQOL at week-8 and no significant differences between Groups A & B at week-16; 2) evaluate influential factors to Aim 1, including contextual patient and parent factors, adherence to the SyMon- SAYS intervention, and symptom communication; and 3) evaluate predictors of adherence to the SyMon-SAYS intervention and preference of SyMon-SAYS versus usual care.

We plan to conduct a single institution modified waitlist control randomized trial of 200 children (ages 8-17) with cancer over 16 weeks (Group A: 16-week SyMon-SAYS intervention; Group B: 8-week usual care and then 8-week SyMon-SAYS intervention) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) evaluate effectiveness of SyMon-SAYS at week-8 and its maintenance effects at week-16. We hypothesize that Group A (versus Group B) will report decreased parent-perceived barriers to managing their children’s symptoms, decreased patient symptom burden, increased patient and parent self-efficacy, and ultimately increased patient HRQOL at week-8 and no significant differences between Groups A & B at week-16; 2) evaluate influential factors to Aim 1, including contextual patient and parent factors, adherence to the SyMon- SAYS intervention, and symptom communication; and 3) evaluate predictors of adherence to the SyMon-SAYS intervention and preference of SyMon-SAYS versus usual care.

To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections, almost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and communities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and affordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and more likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies among AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating that the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing PA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0- 20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal level) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a private Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community level) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA tracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other activities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be recruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site RCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group, to achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 - To improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life. Analyses of hypothesized mediation factors for Aims 1-3 and post-trial qualitative interviews among participants with and without private health insurance will provide explanatory knowledge to help refine intervention procedures and tailor the intervention for future RCTs among patient subgroups who will most benefit. If shown to be efficacious, this mHealth intervention to improve PA in AYA survivors is highly scalable because smartphones and social media are widespread, PA trackers are popular and affordable, goal setting can be automated, and social media activities do not require specialized staff.

Although cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity are the earliest and most dramatic immune related adverse events (irAEs) after CARTx, severe manifestations are transient and only affect a minority of patients. In contrast, on-target, off- tumor depletion of non-malignant B lineage cells affects the majority of patients and all long-term responders. CD19 expression declines as B cells differentiate into plasma cells, whereas BCMA is selectively expressed by plasma cells. Since plasma cells are responsible for maintaining long-lived antibodies and naïve/memory B cells are important for generating new immunity, CD19 versus BCMA-CARTx may differentially affect preexisting immunity and vaccine responses. Dr. Hill’s goal is to understand the long-term effects of CARTx on humoral immunity. This proposal incorporates the expertise of an outstanding group of researchers in infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, epidemiology, laboratory medicine, and statistics who are dedicated to ensuring the success of this innovative research proposal. They will leverage their expertise and high-volume immunotherapy programs to achieve the following aims. The first Aim involves a prospective observational cohort study of 130 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 50 pediatric CD19, 30 adult BCMA) with relapse-free survival ≥6 months. Dr. Hill will use a novel systematic viral epitope scanning method (VirScan) to longitudinally characterize the antivirome to 206 viral pathogens. These results will describe, and identify correlates of, antivirome diversity metrics at 6- and 12-months post-CARTx. VirScan will allow for a nuanced assessment of the differential impacts of CARTx on humoral immune competence. The second Aim will utilize samples from Aim 1 to determine the effect of CARTx on the durability of preexisting humoral immunity to vaccine-preventable infections and the proportion of patients lacking seroprotection after CARTx. These data will expand on Aim 1 to inform vaccination strategies. In the third Aim, Dr. Hill will perform a prospective observational study of 95 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 25 pediatric CD19, and 20 adult BCMA) to define the frequency and correlates of positive vaccine responses ≥6 months after CARTx. Patients will be vaccinated for S. pneumoniae, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, H. influenza b, and hepatitis A and B according to institutional guidelines. This proposal will address critical knowledge gaps by employing innovative methods to elucidate the scope of pathogen-specific deficits in humoral immunity, and whether vaccination can mitigate these irAEs, after CARTx. The findings will guide evidence-based strategies for infection prevention, such as vaccination or immunoglobulin replacement, to improve outcomes in this rapidly growing population of high-risk individuals.

Several of these therapies have now gained FDA approval and are part of routine treatment regimens for several malignancies. Despite the overall success of immunotherapeutic regimens, existing modalities present complications that current research efforts seek to overcome: (1) systemic delivery of checkpoint blockade monoclonal antibodies lead to diverse and unpredictable immune-related adverse events (irAE), (2) boosting responses from the endogenous antitumor repertoire often relies on the existence of pre- primed antitumor T cells, which in the case of highly immunosuppressive tumors or those with low mutational burden may be extremely rare, and (3) attempts to combine immunotherapies to additively boost T cell responses demonstrate increased on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Thus, to circumvent toxicity and immunosuppression, contemporary strategies focus on developing methods to deliver potent immunostimulants directly into a tumor, locally priming antitumor T cells to attack disseminated metastases exhibiting a similar antigenic profile. Bridging these observations, the goals of this proposal are to engineer probiotic strains of bacteria that selectively colonize colorectal cancer (CRC) and locally release immune checkpoint blockade. We hypothesize that this approach will result in more robust and diversified antitumor T cell immunity and promote the clearance of colonized primary and metastatic colorectal cancer lesions and systemically growing CRC-derived foci. The primary innovations of this proposal are in engineering probiotics as an immunotherapeutic delivery vector to locally release high-dose immune checkpoint blockade. Specifically, the proposed system has several advantages over current therapeutic strategies, including: (1) tumor-specific production of immunotherapies and LPS adjuvant, (2) bacteria lysis, leading to effective release of novel immunotherapeutics and LPS, (3) local delivery of novel immunotherapeutics that are toxic to deliver systemically, and (4) oral delivery of probiotics that selectively colonize CRC metastases. This work seeks to shift current research and clinical practice paradigms to overcome current limitations of immunotherapies, by providing a unique vehicle to locally deliver immunotherapies that stimulate antitumor immunity while preventing systemic toxicity and mitigating irAE.

However, CART-evoked severe or fatal immune-related adverse events (irAE) including cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) are significant clinical barriers and safety concerns that impede CART use in cancer patients, even with strict patient monitoring and supportive care. Current tools for mitigating such immunotoxicities/CRS target individual cytokines/receptors (e.g. IL-6R, IL-1Ra, GM-CSF) or nonspecific immunosuppression, but preventing and treating such toxicity will require better understanding of cellular/molecular mediators of CART-induced CRS. This project aims to overcome these barriers and enable more effective interventions against immunotoxicities, and thus more effective CART treatments, building upon the PIs' novel, potentially translatable findings of a key role of catecholamines (CATs) in shaping CART therapy- associated immune activation. We found that blocking CAT synthesis both reduced CRS during CART therapy in mice and also enhanced its tumor eradication, and also found that CAT levels are elevated in patients with CART-evoked CRS, and correlated with symptoms and IL-6 levels, suggesting CATs contribute to human CRS pathophysiology. The project's goal is to identify the mechanistic CRS-modulating roles of these novel CAT actions and their impacts on macrophages and anti-tumor responses, and assess translational potential for improving CART cancer therapy outcomes using human patient samples. Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the mediating α1-AR subtype and its role in modulating CART-evoked cytokine release and anti-tumor responses in vitro and in vivo, based on our finding that CAT-associated cytokine release is mediated by α1-adrenergic receptors (α1-AR), of as-yet unknown subtype(s). We will identify the α1-AR subtype(s) that mainly mediate(s) CAT-evoked cytokine production in macrophages and CART, using in vitro co-culture assays and a mouse CART therapy model via genetic knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) of α1-AR subtypes. 2) Determine the impact of myeloid-derived CATs on cytokine release and myeloid function during CART-therapy in vitro and in a mouse model, by inactivating CAT synthesis in myeloid cells via tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) KO, and assess its impact on cytokine release and macrophage function in a co-culture assay and in vivo using a LysM-Cre-mediated TH KO mouse. 3) Assess CAT induction in human patients during CART therapy, and CATs' dual impacts on irAE and tumor responses, and potential utility of CAT measures and blockers in predicting and preventing CRS, by quantifying circulating CAT and cytokine levels in patient serum samples collected during CART therapy, and evaluating correlations of CAT levels with clinical and laboratory CRS indices, anti-tumor responses and survival.

project	5U01CA250549-02	U01CA250549	10186722	2021	Development and implementation of multiplex methods to understand the biology and heterogeneity of patient-derived cancer models	Grant	Abstract Experimental models of cancer provide the means both to decipher the molecular basis of cancer and to develop new therapeutic agents. To date, most cancer research has employed established cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models. Although these models have provided tremendous insight into many aspects of cancer initiation and progression, each of these models has important limitations, including adaptation to culture (cell lines), lack of genomic instability (mouse models), and inadequate representation of the spectrum of mutations and subtypes of human cancers. Next generation cancer models (NGCMs) such as organoid models have recently been developed. NGCMs address many deficits of prior models and promise to accelerate cancer research and experimental therapeutic efforts.  Recent methodological advances now make it possible to create patient-derived cancer cell lines and organoids with increased efficiency. When coupled with genomic analysis, these new models may facilitate new insights into human cancers. However, organoids require complex culture conditions and display distinct properties that pose challenges for implementation of standard molecular and cell biology techniques. To facilitate widespread use of organoid models within the research community, we must develop innovative technologies to overcome these challenges and enable study of organoids for a range of cancer phenotypes.  In this Project, we will build on our expertise in the development of genome scale and informatic methods as well as our work to derive many of the HCMI models with the goal of developing high throughput approaches to perform genetic and small molecule screens in patient-derived organoids created by the Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI). In addition, we will use innovative methods to interrogate cell state plasticity and heterogeneity in these models. These studies will allow the cancer research community to perform both high and low throughput analyses in patient-derived models and to provide deep insight into the stability and phenotypes represented by these models. While we will focus our technology development efforts using pancreatic cancer organoids, we anticipate that the approaches developed in this proposal will be widely applicable to many different models from a range of cancer types.  In Aim 1, we will develop and implement a highly multiplexed method to screen patient-derived organoid models with both small molecules and genetic reagents. These studies will provide a powerful approach to interrogating HCMI models at high throughput.

project	5U01CA250549-03	U01CA250549	10458506	2022	Development and implementation of multiplex methods to understand the biology and heterogeneity of patient-derived cancer models	Grant	Abstract Experimental models of cancer provide the means both to decipher the molecular basis of cancer and to develop new therapeutic agents. To date, most cancer research has employed established cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models. Although these models have provided tremendous insight into many aspects of cancer initiation and progression, each of these models has important limitations, including adaptation to culture (cell lines), lack of genomic instability (mouse models), and inadequate representation of the spectrum of mutations and subtypes of human cancers. Next generation cancer models (NGCMs) such as organoid models have recently been developed. NGCMs address many deficits of prior models and promise to accelerate cancer research and experimental therapeutic efforts.  Recent methodological advances now make it possible to create patient-derived cancer cell lines and organoids with increased efficiency. When coupled with genomic analysis, these new models may facilitate new insights into human cancers. However, organoids require complex culture conditions and display distinct properties that pose challenges for implementation of standard molecular and cell biology techniques. To facilitate widespread use of organoid models within the research community, we must develop innovative technologies to overcome these challenges and enable study of organoids for a range of cancer phenotypes.  In this Project, we will build on our expertise in the development of genome scale and informatic methods as well as our work to derive many of the HCMI models with the goal of developing high throughput approaches to perform genetic and small molecule screens in patient-derived organoids created by the Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI). In addition, we will use innovative methods to interrogate cell state plasticity and heterogeneity in these models. These studies will allow the cancer research community to perform both high and low throughput analyses in patient-derived models and to provide deep insight into the stability and phenotypes represented by these models. While we will focus our technology development efforts using pancreatic cancer organoids, we anticipate that the approaches developed in this proposal will be widely applicable to many different models from a range of cancer types.  In Aim 1, we will develop and implement a highly multiplexed method to screen patient-derived organoid models with both small molecules and genetic reagents. These studies will provide a powerful approach to interrogating HCMI models at high throughput. In Aim 2, we will build on our preliminary studies that indicate that patient-derived organoids exhibit heterogeneity and rapid shifts in expressed phenotypes. We will interrogate the dynamics of these state changes and assess the degrees of heterogeneity in these models using newly developed physical and sequencing methodology. In Aim 3, we will build on Project Achilles and the DepMap (www.DepMap.org) to create and implement an optimized genome scale CRISPR-Cas9 library that permits the systematic genetic interrogation of genetic dependencies in patient-derived organoids.

These Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter Organoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) include: Synthetic Promoter Activated Recombination of Kaleidoscopic Organoids (SPARKO), Combinatorial Genetics En Masse (CombiGEM), and single-cell RNA sequencing panorama (Scanorama). SPARKO can annotate heterogeneous cancer populations in living cells via fluorescent protein expression libraries to make multi- colored tumor organoids. CombiGEM can rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets via large-scale, massively parallel, and unbiased combinatorial genetic screens. Scanorama can integrate the analysis of large datasets of single-cell transcriptomics via sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. These tools focus on barcoding strategies to enable accurate tracking and analysis of individual tumor cells that harbor distinct genetic aberrations, and substantially expand the utility of the Next Generation Cancer Models (NGCMs) for cancer mechanistic investigations or therapeutic discovery. The StarOrchard tools enable targeted genetic perturbations in annotated heterogeneous tumor phenotypes without destroying cells for sequencing. These tools will be applied to a large number and variety of NGCMs to optimize experimental protocol. To ensure success, we have convened an outstanding team: PI Timothy K. Lu, MD, PhD, has made strikingly original contributions to Synthetic Biology tools that enable high-throughput genetic interrogation of cancer cell drug dependency; PI Ömer Yilmaz, MD, PhD, has extensive expertise in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and has developed novel technologies to maintain patient-derived colon cancer organoids for in vivo modeling; and PI Bonnie Berger, PhD, will use her expertise in bioinformatics and her Scanorama algorithm to integrate data across all tumor types based on dynamic single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We are also supported by leading experts in cancer biology and various cancer types at both the basic science and clinical oncology frontiers of cancer research.

project	5U01CA250565-02	U01CA250565	10229465	2021	Advanced tools for HCMI model genetic perturbation and metastasis characterization	Grant	ABSTRACT The Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI) is creating next generation cancer models that will drive the future of cancer precision medicine research. Historical cancer cell lines have been selected for their rapid proliferation on tissue culture plastic, which has made them amenable to high throughput screening such as genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screens. However, the historical lines have large gaps in their representation of the diversity of human cancer, and they may lack physiological relevance given their optimization for rapid proliferation. Next generation HCMI models address these concerns, but will require the development of new methods to make them useful. Specifically, standard approaches to genome editing (involving first creating Cas9- stably expressing lines and then introducing guide RNAs) will not work for slowly proliferating cells often growing in 3D. We will therefore develop all-in-one genome editing vector systems that will make it possible to bring the power of genome editing to HCMI models. In addition, standard viability read-outs of such “drop-out” screens involve the growth of cells over many population doublings. But for slowly proliferating HCMI models, alternative readouts will be required for efficient screening. We will therefore develop short-term single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) methods that will serve as surrogate read-outs for long-term viability. Given the clinical annotation associated with HCMI models, there is also enormous opportunity to expand the use of these models beyond viability measures to more complex, physiologically relevant phenotypes such as organ-specific metastatic potential. We will therefore develop methods that make it possible to determine the metastatic potential for next generation cancer models, and we will create a public resource of the metastasis map (MetMap) for at least 50 HCMI models. All data and protocols will be made publicly available without restriction, all reagents will be made available via Addgene, and all modified models made available to ATCC for distribution. Importantly, throughout the project, all cell models will be rigorously monitored for evidence of genetic and epigenetic drift. At the conclusion of the proposed project, we expect to have generated a set of tools and data that will help propel the future of cancer precision medicine based on next generation cancer models.	3-Dimensional;Address;Bar Codes;Benchmarking;Brain;CRISPR screen;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Model;Cancer cell line;Cell model;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Communities;Complex;Computational Science;Consumption;Data;Development;Dropout;Ensure;Enzymes;Epigenetic Process;Future;Gene Expression Profiling;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Screening;Growth;Guide RNA;Human;Immunodeficient Mouse;Injections;Kidney;Knock-out;Libraries;Liver;Lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organ;Organoids;Outcome;Phenotype;Physiological;Population;Proliferating;Protocols documentation;Reagent;Research;Resources;System;Systems Biology;Time;Translational Research;Ultrasonography;anticancer research;base;bone;cell growth;cost;experimental study;functional genomics;gene discovery;genome editing;genome-wide;high throughput screening;in vivo;innovation;model development;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;next generation;patient response;precision medicine;precision oncology;scale up;screening;single-cell RNA sequencing;targeted treatment;technology development;tissue culture;tool;tumor;tumor microenvironment;vector	BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.

However, there are enormous challenges to implementing successful cascade genetic risk evaluation in families with hereditary cancer syndromes. The clinical context of GRE after cancer diagnosis is increasingly complex: As MGP testing has become the norm, guideline organizations have converged on a list of >40 cancer susceptibility genes in which PVs are clinically actionable, with wide variability in cancer threat and a myriad of strategies for prevention and early detection. A daunting challenge is that the cancer patient is responsible for communication and engagement of relatives for GRE. Despite the shared health threat among at risk relatives (ARRs), the social and contextual factors that affect family communication are complex. Furthermore, ARRs are dispersed world- wide and receive care in disparate health care practices. Importantly, there is little incentive and limited resources for clinicians to engage cancer patients’ relatives and genetic counseling services are increasingly strained. Given the lack of guidance for families, it is not surprising that most ARRs of cancer patients with PVs do not undergo GRE. We are uniquely positioned to develop and optimize a direct-to-family virtual genetic risk evaluation and testing solution offered to all at risk relatives of a population-based sample of adults recently diagnosed with cancer in Georgia and California who tested positive for a clinically relevant PV. We will use a unique data infrastructure we pioneered to identify and invite a diverse cohort of cancer patients with clinically relevant PVs and their families to participate in our study. We propose a 2 x 3 factorial randomized trial of 900 patients diagnosed in 2018-2019 in the two states who had a clinically significant PV detected by genetic testing that will offer genetic risk evaluation and testing to all 1st and 2nd degree relatives. We will evaluate the effects of two intervention design features on patient- and relative-centered outcomes: 1) the level of personalized family genetic risk support (a technology assisted personally tailored patient and family member education and communication tool called the Family Genetic Health Program, FGHP) vs. the FGHP plus direct assistance from a human FGHP Navigator); and 2) the price offered to the relatives for the genetic test (standard $200 vs. $100 vs. $50 per test). We will determine the independent effects of the two design features on 1) the cancer patient’s appraisal of communication and their engagement with relatives about hereditary cancer and GRE; 2) the invited relative’s appraisal of decision-making and receipt of genetic testing; and 3) on the enrolled relative’s completion of formal GRE. We will also explore the effect of the features on the outcomes across patient SES subgroups. The findings of this study have enormous potential to improve cancer prevention and early detection in families at high risk of hereditary cancer syndromes in the US.

Rather, it is critical to access appropriate follow-up care that may include cancer risk management (CRM) options for individuals and their at-risk family members. Current gaps in implementation of guideline-adherent follow-up care based on inherited cancer genetic test results include both over and under treatment among those with pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Furthermore, we are missing the opportunity to magnify the uptake and impact of testing among family members who are at high risk due to suboptimal family communication (FC) of genetic test results and cancer family history. Our highly innovative and practice-changing study is designed to shift the paradigm by which individuals with P/LP variants and VUS in inherited cancer genes are provided with information to enhance guideline-adherent CRM and FC of test results. Through our proposed type I effectiveness-implementation hybrid randomized control mixed methods study, we will test two interventions with a diverse group of 600 individuals with a P/LP variant or a VUS result in a variety of inherited cancer genes for which CRM guidelines are available. Intervention A is focused on increasing guideline- adherent CRM (LivingLabReport), and Intervention B is focused on increasing FC and subsequent family testing (GeneSHARE). Alongside developing, refining, and testing interventions to improve guideline-adherent CRM and FC, we will study the implementation of these interventions across racially, geographically, and socio- economically diverse populations and settings. The information gathered through testing effectiveness and implementation of the interventions will be used to develop, modify and pilot test adaptive stepped interventions with the potential to efficiently maximize effectiveness in improving guideline-adherent CRM and FC. This transdisciplinary effort, enriched for accrual of Blacks, rural dwellers, and other underserved populations, will inform policy and the development of scalable models for delivering evidence-based care. Ultimately, our study will help address the need for access to effective information to guide CRM and enhance FC in diverse populations across various genes and settings which is greatly needed if the population at large is to benefit from genomic advances in this era of personalized medicine.

However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it possible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence at a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor cells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune- stimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine RT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the types of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating effects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral cancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate. Studies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an immunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti- tumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor microenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1) determine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer to RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the immunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug formulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will accomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance in mouse oral cancer models. In Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment with RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses. In Aim 3 we will develop a novel drug delivery system that can enhance delivery of inhibitors of MDSC function directly to the tumor and tumor-infiltrating MDSC.

project	5U01DK124165-02	U01DK124165	10176481	2021	Characterizing and predicting colitis in immune checkpoint blockade-treated cancer patients	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY  The first combination immunotherapy of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) approved for melanoma in 2015 has achieved longer progression-free survival compared to nivolumab alone (11.5 vs. 6.9 months), with 53% of patients still alive at 4 years, of whom 71% remain treatment free. Yet, safety is the biggest barrier to broader implementation of this successful combination, due to much greater occurrence of serious immune-related adverse events (irAEs) compared to nivolumab alone. In particular, immune-related colitis (irColitis) is the most common occurrence, with 10-15% of patients developing it upon receiving anti- CTLA-4 alone or in combinations. Such irColitis is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment with high- dose steroids or biologics such as anti-TNF, as well as ipilimumab or immunotherapy discontinuation. These safety concerns have hampered the development of CTLA-4 targeting agents and may have reduced their efficacy due to lower recommended dosing in combination therapy and limited treatment course. There is therefore an urgent need to comprehensively study the nature of irColitis and find whether potential risk factors could be identified and mitigated for greater safety and efficacy of combination treatments.  We have assembled a unique team of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) scientists and clinicians, tumor immunologists, microbiome specialists, and medical oncologists specializing in immunotherapy of melanoma to analyze colorectal tissue lesions, the gut microbiome, and peripheral blood biomarkers that could predict or contribute to development of irColitis. By comparing what we already learned from studying biospecimens of IBD patients, i.e., their genetic subsets at the single cell level, gut microbiome, and predictive immune signatures, we aim to characterize the transcriptomic, immunopathologic, serologic, and gut microbiome landscape of irColitis and leverage this knowledge for better therapeutic options.  We will address irColitis by characterizing gut biopsies of melanoma patients during treatment using single- cell RNA sequencing and multiplex immunohistochemistry mapping, and we will relate immune subsets and markers discovered to those found in IBD lesions. We will also measure peripheral blood serologic markers (anti-microbial and anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies by ELISA, soluble cytokine and protein analytes with Olink proximity extension assay) that we recently found to be risk factors detectable prior to development of IBD, and analyze them for their capacity to predict irColitis. From stool collected before and throughout treatment, we will analyze by 16S and metagenomic sequencing the gut microbiome of melanoma patients with or without irColitis to compare it to known colitogenic structure in IBD, and functionally assess bacterial communities in gnotobiotic models. Finally, we will integrate our findings to establish a mechanistic model of irColitis compared to IBD, to propose novel stratifications of cancer immunotherapy patients by risk factors, and to offer future therapeutic opportunities, such as actionable tissue genomic and protein targets or fecal transplants.	16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Address;Antibodies;Autoantibodies;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;CTLA4 blockade;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials Design;Colitis;Colorectal;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Crohn&apos;s disease;Data;Development;Disease remission;Dose;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Feces;Flowers;Future;Genetic;Genomics;Gnotobiotic;Goals;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immunohistochemistry;Immunologist;Immunotherapy;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Intestines;Knowledge;Lamina Propria;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical Oncologist;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibodies;Nature;Nivolumab;Patient risk;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Predictive Value;Progression-Free Survivals;Proteins;Proteomics;Risk Factors;Safety;Scientist;Serology;Serum;Serum Markers;Specialist;Specimen;Steroids;Stratification;Structure;Symptoms;TNF gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Treatment Side Effects;Ulcerative Colitis;anti-CTLA4;anti-PD-1;antimicrobial;bacterial community;base;cancer immunotherapy;clinical development;cytokine;density;fecal transplantation;frontier;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;immune checkpoint;immune checkpoint blockade;immune-related adverse events;improved;ipilimumab;melanoma;metagenomic sequencing;microbial;microbiome;microbiome analysis;microbiome composition;microbiome signature;novel;patient subsets;peripheral blood;predictive marker;prospective;response;serological marker;single cell analysis;single-cell RNA sequencing;targeted agent;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions	ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Jean-Frederic  Colombel,Jeremiah James Faith,Sacha  Gnjatic	DCB	Aynur  Unalp-Arida	577498	$500k to $749k	385790	5-Jul-2021	1-Jun-2020	31-May-2025	RFA-CA-19-044	Moonshot

Reasons for the greater burden of aggressive disease in AA men are unknown, but are likely to include a multitude of factors including social factors such as lifetime stress, inherited susceptibility, and tumor-related features such as somatic alterations and local inflammation in the microenvironment. The overarching goal of this Program Project is to uncover the social and biological factors that are related to PCa aggressiveness in AA men. To accomplish this objective, we will establish a large, national, population-based cohort study, RESPOND, (Research on Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry: Defining the Roles of Genetics, Immunity and Social Stress) of 10,000 AA men with incident PCa identified through nine SEER and NPCR U.S. cancer registries from states that include 38% of all AA PCa cases in the U.S.. The cohort will provide comprehensive information on multilevel stressors over the lifecourse such as discrimination, early-life adversity, and neighborhood disorder, including geospatial neighborhood data over time and degree of perceived stress; 2) lifestyle factors and health behaviors; 3) disease-specific factors including PSA screening history and treatment choice; 4) germline DNA to study genetic susceptibility, and 5) tumor block samples for characterization of somatic variation and immune profiling of the tumor microenvironment. No previous study has attempted to obtain information across these domains in a single large sample in order to understand the relative contribution of each and relationships between molecular and non-genetic components. In order to address these goals, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and clinicians with established track records in PCa research. Leveraging the RESPOND resource and investigator expertise, we have designed a Program Project composed of four Projects that are supported by four Cores which are all focused on the central theme of identifying social and biological factors related to PCa disease aggressiveness in AA men. These Projects include: the investigation of multilevel social stressors across the lifecourse in relationship with aggressive PCa (Project 1); genome-wide discovery efforts of germline susceptibility loci for aggressive PCa and examination of the relationship between germline and somatic variation (Project 2); the identification of underlying somatic alterations in PCa tumors and biological pathways that are related to aggressive disease (Project 3); and, a detailed assessment of inflammation in the tumor microenvironment as it relates to PCa aggressiveness in AA men (Project 4). Each of the four Projects address a distinct research domain, however, when studied together, create scientific synergy and a far more comprehensive picture of the major factors that contribute to aggressive PCa in AA men. The information we will discover is likely to have immediate clinical implications in the areas of improved patient stratification and personalized medicine. Hence, this study has broad reaching significance and addresses numerous challenges in the clinical management of PCa in AA men.

project	5U24CA180803-04	U24CA180803	9240602	2017	Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) Group	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of the imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) Group is to provide scientific and technical expertise for incorporation of appropriate, integrated Quality Assurance (QA) and image data management for both imaging and radiotherapy (RT) in applicable trials conducted by the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Program. The leading QA centers; RPC, QARC, RTOG QA, ITC, ACRIN and CALGB/SWOG Imaging Core lab, in the current NCI Cooperative Group Program have joined together to form the IROC Group, administratively organized through the American College of Radiology (ACR) Clinical Research Center. The creation of IROC capitalizes on existing infrastructure and expertise at QA Centers currently providing services to the NCI Cooperative Groups. Work flows, processes and information systems currently in place will be further enhanced taking the best practices and standards in an integrated vision. The interdependencies between imaging and RT will be synergized in this QA Group eliminating duplication of services and optimizing towards efficient and effective workflows. A major strength of IROC will be the development of consistent standard operating procedures for all imaging and RT aspects of the NCTN and to facilitate a seamless flow of imaging and RT patient case datasets across the network. IROC's organizational structure allows the delivery of a broad array of imaging and RT QA services including Site Qualification; Trial Design Support; Credentialing; Data Management (Pre- and Post- Review); and Case Review. An information technology infrastructure will be developed that harmonizes IROC services, data collection, assessment and management for the NCTN Groups' clinical trials. IROC will implement programs that assure consistent high quality imaging and RT planning/delivery across the NCTN participating sites. IROC members will collaborate with the NCTN disease/modality committees within each Network Group to provide an optimal and effective imaging and RT core service.

The leading QA centers; RPC, QARC, RTOG QA, ITC, ACRIN and CALGB/SWOG Imaging Core lab, in the current NCI Cooperative Group Program have joined together to form the IROC Group, administratively organized through the American College of Radiology (ACR) Clinical Research Center. The creation of IROC capitalizes on existing infrastructure and expertise at QA Centers currently providing services to the NCI Cooperative Groups. Work flows, processes and information systems currently in place will be further enhanced taking the best practices and standards in an integrated vision. The interdependencies between imaging and RT will be synergized in this QA Group eliminating duplication of services and optimizing towards efficient and effective workflows. A major strength of IROC will be the development of consistent standard operating procedures for all imaging and RT aspects of the NCTN and to facilitate a seamless flow of imaging and RT patient case datasets across the network. IROC's organizational structure allows the delivery of a broad array of imaging and RT QA services including Site Qualification; Trial Design Support; Credentialing; Data Management (Pre- and Post- Review); and Case Review. An information technology infrastructure will be developed that harmonizes IROC services, data collection, assessment and management for the NCTN Groups' clinical trials. IROC will implement programs that assure consistent high quality imaging and RT planning/delivery across the NCTN participating sites. IROC members will collaborate with the NCTN disease/modality committees within each Network Group to provide an optimal and effective imaging and RT core service. IROC will analyze QA data obtained prospectively/retrospectively to further advance QA science.

The falling cost of genomic assays facilitates collection of multiple data types (e.g., gene and transcript expression, structural variation, copy number, methylation, and microRNA data) from a set of clinical specimens. Furthermore, substantial resources are now available from large consortium activities like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Existing analysis pipelines focus on the treatment of a specific data type, leaving a critical need for tool for integrative analysis of multiple genomic assays for locally generated or publicly available data. R / Bioconductor has historically provided standardized genomic data structures and annotations that have enjoyed widespread adoption in the cancer genomics research community. This proposal adapts R / Bioconductor to meet the increasing conceptual and computational complexity of multi-assay cancer genomic experiments. We begin by developing software containers for coordinated representation, manipulation, and transformation of heterogeneous derived data from multiple cancer genomic assays. These containers are then extended to manage very large primary data resources. To facilitate integration of local experimental results with major public cancer genomics experiment data sets and annotations, we re-package public resources and provide software and cloud-based facilities for easy and fast programmatic access from within R/Bioconductor. This greatly simplifies cancer genomic analysis tasks that otherwise require significant, error-prone individual efforts. Finally, we provide software infrastructure to enable high-throughput computation using parallel and iterative approaches. The ability to manipulate multi-assay cancer genomic experiments, to understand individual experimental results in the context of public experiments and annotations, and facilities for improved high-throughput computational performance in a well-established computing environment greatly enhances opportunities for analysis and comprehension of large multi-assay cancer genomic experiments.

project	5U24CA180996-08	U24CA180996	10017896	2020	Cancer Genomics: Integrative and Salable Solutions in R/Bioconductor	Grant	Abstract Bioconductor is an ecosystem of more than 1,500 open-source software and data packages for the statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is widely used by the cancer genomics research community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core data classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and efficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell assays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of DNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a single specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the data. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to meet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of single-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant prioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of experimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create provenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in prioritization. Third, we develop scalable infrastructure for the curation, distribution, maintenance, discoverability, and usability of cancer data resources within and externally to Bioconductor. Finally, we develop a program of user training and new outreach approaches to support adoption of advanced Bioconductor infrastructure by developers of new cancer-related packages and existing packages critical to the cancer research community.

project	5U24CA194215-02	U24CA194215	9331533	2017	Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics	Grant	﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities.

Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research.

It's open and flexible environment enables interoperation of diverse bioinformatics software via a user-friendly web-based interface. Despite its proven value for genomic bioinformatics, Galaxy's potential for enabling cancer research has not been fully realized. One area of emerging potential for Galaxy is multi- omic informatics. Multi-omics integrates high throughput genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomics data to reveal new molecular discoveries in cancer. For example, integrating metabolomics information with genomic and/or proteomic data reveals biochemical consequences of gene and protein variations underlying carcinogenesis. Integration of genomic or transcriptomic data with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic data (proteogenomics) identifies novel protein variants linked to genome mutations. Integration of metagenomic data with MS-based proteomic data (metaproteomics) identifies proteins expressed by microbial communities giving insights into biochemical contributions from the microbiome to carcinogenesis. Despite their potential pay-off, these multi-omic approaches require use of diverse informatics tools out of the reach of most bench researchers. Fortunately, Galaxy offers a solution. We propose to extend Galaxy and create a powerful, unified hub for multi-omic informatics. We will focus on enhancing Galaxy with a stand-alone Multi-omics Visualization Platform (MVP) for results visualization and interpretation. We will build novel Galaxy extensions enabling metabolite profiling, results interpretation and targeted clinical validation studies. We will extend current Galaxy-based tools to create a complete solution for proteogenomic and metaproteomic informatics, making easy-to-build workflows that ensure accurate results. Finally, we will empower cancer researchers to use Galaxy for multi-omics in their work via a variety of dissemination and training activities. We will achieve these outcomes via these Specific Aims: 1) Extend a Galaxy-compatible Multi-omics Visualization Platform (MVP) for enhanced results interpretation and data exchange utilizing cancer knowledge bases and informatics resources; 2) Extend Galaxy and the MVP tool for metabolite profiling in cancer research; 3) Extend Galaxy and the MVP tool for integrative genomic-proteomic informatics and workflows.; 4) Catalyze the use of multi-omic workflows and associated tools by cancer researchers via dissemination, promotion and training activities. Our work will be guided via driving cancer projects with a network of collaborators. We will partner with developers of established software and methods in different 'omic domains, and utilize world-class infrastructure at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. Our deliverables will directly complement other projects currently funded through the NIH ITCR program. The upshot of our work will be a large network of cancer researchers empowered to utilize high impact, multi-omic approaches, ultimately catalyzing new discoveries that will help decrease the suffering and death from cancer.

MD Anderson Cancer Center has been a leader in the implementation of this antibody-based technology that can assess many protein markers across large numbers of samples in a cost-effective, sensitive and high-throughput manner. The platform currently assesses ~300 protein markers, covering all major signaling pathways and most drug targets. Its utility was demonstrated through its selection as the sole platform for characterizing >10,000 patient samples through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA); and recently it has been designated as one of two NCI Genome Characterization Centers, and will characterize up to ~10,000 samples from ongoing NCI initiatives and other consortium projects. For TCGA project, the applicants built The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), a web platform for visualizing and analyzing RPPA data, which has a community of >5,000 users worldwide. The long-term goal is to promote the ability of functional proteomics to impact cancer research and the development of relevant therapeutic strategies. The current objective is to expand the scope of TCPA by adding new functionalities and datasets, and to enhance and improve its existing analytic capabilities. Working relationships have been formed to link TCPA with other widely used bioinformatic resources (e.g., cBio, UCSC Genome Browsers, Firehose and Synpase) and other ITCR projects. An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: Aim #1. Develop an open source, all-in-one software package for processing RPPA data. This effort will standardize each informatic step for RPPA data generation including experimental design, quality control, and data normalization. The resultant program will be exported to other RPPA facilities. Aim #2. Expand and enhance our existing web platform for the analysis of patient-cohort RPPA data. The web platform will cover other patient cohorts, incorporate other types of molecular/clinical data, and provide pathway/network-based analytics. Aim #3. Build a user-friendly, interactive, open web platform for the analysis of cell line RPPA data. This effort will collect and compile RPPA data of >1,500 cell lines, and develop a web platform parallel to Aim #2. Aim #4. Promote TCPA and active interaction with the user community. This effort will provide documentation, hands-on workshops, and bug fixes, and build web APIs for interaction with other tools. The expected outcome is the first, dedicated bioinformatic resource that fully integrates RPPA data generation, analysis and user feedback, allowing for fluent exploration and analysis of high-quality proteomic data in a rich context. The project is important because it will greatly enhance the quality and reproducibility of RPPA data from important consortium projects; substantially reduce barriers biomedical researchers face in mining complex functional proteomic data; serve as a hub for integrating proteomic data into other widely used bioinformatic resources; and directly facilitate development of protein markers for precision cancer medicine.

An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: Aim #1. Develop an open source, all-in-one software package for processing RPPA data. This effort will standardize each informatic step for RPPA data generation including experimental design, quality control, and data normalization. The resultant program will be exported to other RPPA facilities. Aim #2. Expand and enhance our existing web platform for the analysis of patient-cohort RPPA data. The web platform will cover other patient cohorts, incorporate other types of molecular/clinical data, and provide pathway/network-based analytics. Aim #3. Build a user-friendly, interactive, open web platform for the analysis of cell line RPPA data. This effort will collect and compile RPPA data of >1,500 cell lines, and develop a web platform parallel to Aim #2. Aim #4. Promote TCPA and active interaction with the user community. This effort will provide documentation, hands-on workshops, and bug fixes, and build web APIs for interaction with other tools. The expected outcome is the first, dedicated bioinformatic resource that fully integrates RPPA data generation, analysis and user feedback, allowing for fluent exploration and analysis of high-quality proteomic data in a rich context. The project is important because it will greatly enhance the quality and reproducibility of RPPA data from important consortium projects; substantially reduce barriers biomedical researchers face in mining complex functional proteomic data; serve as a hub for integrating proteomic data into other widely used bioinformatic resources; and directly facilitate development of protein markers for precision cancer medicine.

We have created open bioinformatics and data resources as part of every large-scale research project in which we have participated, covering a diverse set of projects involving clinical, imaging, `omics, and mobile sensor data related to research in oncology. Over the past 4 years, we have developed Synapse, an informatics platform for hosting scientific data, code, and knowledge, and have established an outstanding track record of effective interactions that engage large scale research consortia. We have tested the Synapse platform by supporting research efforts that required dozens to hundreds of scientists to share data, analysis code, and results in real time. This platform, and the activities of Sage's data scientists and curators, form the basis for the Resource Coordinating Hub. These efforts provide a model for our interactions with the other CSBC and PS-ON centers in the Collaboration and Pilot Project Hub.

We have assembled an outstanding team of basic and clinical scientists to discover and confirm proteins and protein modifications associated with cancer progression using genoproteomic approaches. This multidisciplinary team will be managed by the same three Principal Investigators (PI) and consists of internationally recognized experts in proteomic technologies, genomics, proteogenomics-specific bioinformatics, biostatistics, oncology, pathology, cancer biology, assay development, quality control, technology optimization, and clinical laboratory science/clinical chemistry. Our team has complementary and integrated expertise with previous and ongoing successful collaborations. The plan is to integrate the genomics findings with proteomic analysis (genoproteomics) and to overcome the caveats and challenges in the comprehensive understanding of tumor biology. We believe that genomic data provides a highly valuable molecular route towards the identification of genes and pathways that could be useful for the detection, differential diagnosis, outcome prediction and therapeutic targets of cancer. The proteomic approaches will provide the identification of unique features that are inherent to proteins including post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. We propose to use the technology platform validated during the current CPTAC which is high throughput, robust and state of the art. These technologies are proven, with the capability of generating reproducible results across labs. We will use a two-step strategy to characterize defined sets of genomically-characterized samples. The first step is the discovery of target proteins from both biological and clinical specimens using mass spectrometry and affinity based technologies. The second step is the confirmation of these targets using high-throughput, CPTAC Tier 2 analytically validated targeted assays, for example, Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry (MRM-MS). In addition, we propose to develop pilot studies for technology improvement. The goal is to generate accurate, reproducible, sensitive, quantitative, and multiplexed assays using optimized and standardized high-throughput technologies for the discovered targets. While this PCC application is focused on the proteomic characterization of biological and clinical specimens, we believe that the understanding of and expertise in proteogenomic data analysis and translation will be critical for the success of the PCC and the overall CPTAC network. Investigators/PIs from our proposed PCC will be part of applications for the CPTAC Proteogenomic Data Analysis (PGDAC) and Translational Research (PTCR) Centers.

project	5U24CA210985-05	U24CA210985	9998921	2020	The Comprehensive Proteome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins: High Precision Discovery and Confirmation of Genoproteomic Targets	Grant	As one of the five current CPTAC PCCs, we propose to leverage our established center to further our research in the comprehensive characterization of biospecimens from human and preclinical models for additional cancer types. We have assembled an outstanding team of basic and clinical scientists to discover and confirm proteins and protein modifications associated with cancer progression using genoproteomic approaches. This multidisciplinary team will be managed by the same three Principal Investigators (PI) and consists of internationally recognized experts in proteomic technologies, genomics, proteogenomics-specific bioinformatics, biostatistics, oncology, pathology, cancer biology, assay development, quality control, technology optimization, and clinical laboratory science/clinical chemistry. Our team has complementary and integrated expertise with previous and ongoing successful collaborations. The plan is to integrate the genomics findings with proteomic analysis (genoproteomics) and to overcome the caveats and challenges in the comprehensive understanding of tumor biology. We believe that genomic data provides a highly valuable molecular route towards the identification of genes and pathways that could be useful for the detection, differential diagnosis, outcome prediction and therapeutic targets of cancer. The proteomic approaches will provide the identification of unique features that are inherent to proteins including post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. We propose to use the technology platform validated during the current CPTAC which is high throughput, robust and state of the art. These technologies are proven, with the capability of generating reproducible results across labs. We will use a two-step strategy to characterize defined sets of genomically-characterized samples. The first step is the discovery of target proteins from both biological and clinical specimens using mass spectrometry and affinity based technologies. The second step is the confirmation of these targets using high-throughput, CPTAC Tier 2 analytically validated targeted assays, for example, Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry (MRM-MS). In addition, we propose to develop pilot studies for technology improvement. The goal is to generate accurate, reproducible, sensitive, quantitative, and multiplexed assays using optimized and standardized high-throughput technologies for the discovered targets. While this PCC application is focused on the proteomic characterization of biological and clinical specimens, we believe that the understanding of and expertise in proteogenomic data analysis and translation will be critical for the success of the PCC and the overall CPTAC network. Investigators/PIs from our proposed PCC will be part of applications for the CPTAC Proteogenomic Data Analysis (PGDAC) and Translational Research (PTCR) Centers. Collaboration and team work are key to the success of the CPTAC program. With this multidisciplinary team of outstanding basic and clinical scientists, our PCC offers the best opportunity for the successful characterization of biological and clinical specimens to discover and confirm cancer targets to advance precision cancer medicine.

In the next phase, the National Cancer Institute and its Center for Cancer Genomics are planning large-scale projects closely tied to clinical questions and trials. In order to perform the analysis of these data, the NCI is creating a Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN) of different types of Genome Data Analysis Centers (GDACs). Central to this Network is a single Processing GDAC, which will take all the harmonized data, as stored in the NCI's Genomics Data Commons, and perform higher level integrated analyses on these data to support both the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) within the Network (which will be formed for each project to perform special analyses of the data and write manuscripts) as well as the entire biomedical research community. Herein we propose to build the centralized Processing GDAC on top of our FireCloud platform, an infrastructure to run large scale computation on the cloud in a fully rigorous and reproducible fashion. FireCloud development was based on our experience with Firehose, the Broad internal platform on which the standard TCGA data and analyses currently run. We propose to create and operate the GDAN Standard Workflow, incorporating tools actively developed and used within the GDAN and across the entire field, with particular emphasis on clinical tools. This Workflow will serve as the starting point for AWGs and set the highest standards of transparency, reproducibility and rigor for cancer genome analysis. The results of the Standard Workflow will be stored in a public database, and accessible via standard APIs, and used together with a continuously updated database of prior knowledge to create scientific reports that will be made available to the community, in a pre-publication manner. Finally, a major innovation is that AWG members will be able to login into FireCloud and rerun the entire workflow, or parts of it, with their own parameters and subsets of the data – thus making the entire GDAN analysis fully reproducible and scalable. Our goals are therefore: (1) To create a global infrastructure for collaborative extreme- scale cancer analysis; (2) Operate the Standard Workflows at scale; (3) Rapidly and continuously evolve the Standard Workflows; and (4) created improved capabilities for reporting, exploring the results, clinical diagnostics and reproducibility.

project	5U24CA224020-03	U24CA224020	10254377	2021	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC)	Grant	ABSTRACT In contrast to the decline in mortality in other cancers, the incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is increasing, and therapeutic approaches, for the most part, have not been successful at improving survival in patients. Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers, comparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an immune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune barriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease. The U01 “Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME” was created through the National Cancer Moonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC, especially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24 RFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio Wistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with respect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental therapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics), Andy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton (co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple areas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01 awardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage capabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing translationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support administrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and access to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will serve as the central “hub” for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we will utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be readily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics services for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well as provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.

project	5U24CA224067-03	U24CA224067	10011774	2020	Data Coordination Center for PDX Net	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are a powerful model system for assessing drug efficacy of anti-cancer agents and understanding molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. However, results from individual research groups have been difficult to validate due to the lack of standardized PDX procedures, lack of scale for adequately powered PDX studies and the inability to efficiently share PDX specimens. A key contributor to this challenge is the lack of well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of integrated, standardized datasets from PDX models. The JAX-Seven Bridges PDX Data Commons and Coordination Center (PDCCC) seeks to address this challenge and unite the efforts of the component data- generating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI’s Patient-Derived Model Repository/PDMR) parts of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research Network (PDXNet) into a cohesive, trans-Network whole. Using innovative cloud computing and bioinformatic approaches, our PDCCC will provide administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX method standardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. We will build a data storage, sharing, and analysis platform that harmonizes PDXNet data with other large datasets and analysis workflows available in the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud. Simultaneously, we will administer planning meetings, training activities, and research pilots to build synergies within the PDXNet, enhancing the ability of the PDXNet to develop clinical trials from PDX studies. Our Specific Aims are to 1) establish a leadership and administration unit to manage and coordinate activities within PDXNet, including annual meetings, regular conference calls, training activities, trans-Network pilot projects, and outreach; 2) develop a cloud- integrated PDXnet Data Commons that integrates PDXNet data with the existing cloud-based data analysis platform - the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC); and 3) build analysis workflows and data sharing practices to optimize PDXNet research and enable PDXNet data to facilitate clinical trial design. To accomplish these Aims we have assembled a team with unique expertise in PDXs, cancer treatment, genomic analysis, data coordination, and project management from The Jackson Laboratory and Seven Bridges. Our combined institutional strengths include a history of leadership in (and commitment) to PDX, data resource, analytic and consensus standards development and application; practical expertise in PDX model sharing and collaborative community efforts; a broad array of statistical, bioinformatic, and software-related PDX resources; leadership expertise in large-scale, cloud-based biomedical data projects, notably the SB-CGC; and deep experience in high-performance database engineering and development.

project	5U24CA224122-03	U24CA224122	10255532	2021	Coordinating Center for Canine Immunotherapy Trials and Correlative Studies	Grant	The primary mission of goal of the Pre-medical Cancer Immunotherapy Network for Canine Trials (PRECINCT) is to facilitate the performance of immunotherapy clinical trials in dogs with cancer and to expedite the identification of immunological correlates of successful therapeutic responses. The PRECINCT will achieve these goal by supporting a highly coordinated clinical trials network of participating U01 sites. As a coordinating center, the PRECINCT will work in consultation with U01 investigators, the Steering Committee, representatives from the Comparative Oncology Program (COP) at NCI and an External Advisory Committee to provide expert services in project management and research technology, data management, biostatistical support and immunological monitoring. Specifically, we will establish a PRECINCT Data Coordinating Center to provide comprehensive project oversight, supervise all project management and regulatory compliance activities, and coordinate site management for all aspects of single and large multi-site projects. Through the PRECINCT, U01 investigators will have ready access to research services and standardized protocols that will facilitate the performance of clinical research across the PRECINCT. We will establish a PRECINCT Data Management System to collect, store and share all clinical and correlative data amongst the U01 sites and with the COP directors and Steering Committee. We will develop the infrastructure necessary to achieve an efficient, highly functioning coordinated network and develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) that can be applied across all PRECINCT-associated U01 projects to ensure high quality, repeatable data sets. We will provide biostatistical support for study design and data analysis to ensure that immunotherapy clinical trials performed within the network are strategically designed and appropriately powered to achieve meaningful clinical and laboratory data results in the most expedite way. The renowned expertise of the University of Pennsylvania in both human and canine clinical trials will foster rapid translation of state-of-the art methods for human clinical study design and analysis to canine clinical trials and results from canine trials can rapidly inform human clinical trials, thus optimizing results for both species. Finally, the University of Pennsylvania is a leader in cancer immunotherapy and is also home to world renowned experts in immune reagent development and immunological monitoring. We will leverage this expertise to both accelerate the mission of the U24 and extend it by providing support for immunologic reagent development for use in correlative studies and biomarker identification. In concert with U01 investigators, the COP and the Steering Committee, we will design, generate and validate several multiparametric, multicolor flow panels and SOPs for their use across the U01 sites. Successful immunologic monitoring will allow canine cancer patients to be streamlined to single or combination therapies most likely to be effective and will provide essential insight for future translational application to human cancer patients.

project	5U24CA252977-02	U24CA252977	10237277	2021	Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS): Coordinating Center	Grant	Abstract Cancer genomics aims to improve our understanding and treatment of all cancers by identifying differences in DNA sequence and gene expression between tumor cells and normal host cells. Cancer genomics has contributed to many advances in treating several cancers, but the field is limited by a lack of genomics data. The Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network will promote and support research on direct participant engagement approaches to address these gaps, especially among rare cancers, highly lethal cancers, cancers with an early age of onset, cancers with high disparities in incidence/mortality, and cancers among under-represented minorities.  Our team wishes to contribute to the important work of the (PE-CGS) Network by serving as its coordinating center. We have the necessary faculty, resources, and experience to address the needs and goals of the Network by supporting network coordination, promoting effective and equitable outreach and promotion, and establishing and disseminating network best practices. In addition to meeting all the requirements of the RFA, we bring innovation by establishing Participant Engagement Community (PEC) by applying the principles of community-based participatory research and by promoting a diverse pool of future scientists, especially those from underrepresented groups through a Summer Scholar Program and by two post-doctoral positions that will be supported by our comprehensive cancer center.  Our proposal for the coordinating center is focused around four specific aims. First, we will effectively manage administrative and scientific coordination of the PE-CGS network. This will include providing administration/coordination, governing all advisory, organizing meetings/site visits, fostering collaboration, dissemination and implementation, and coordinating communication. Second, we will foster effective and culturally appropriate outreach and promotion activities. We will establish a common branded, public relations, communication resources, facilitating interactions, and managing outreach. Third, we will develop and disseminate network best practices and data collection/processing standards. We provide support for participant engagement and cancer genome sequencing activities, establish data standards, ensure data are accessible to the public, data are appropriately shared, and support efforts to make the Network sustainable. Finally, we want to address health disparities and promote equity throughout the Network and ensure there is a diverse pool of future scientists, including those from underrepresented groups, to support future efforts in participant engagement and cancer genomics. We envision that the network will need to evolve to address emerging issues in participant engagement and believe that being based in a university setting will provide us the capacity to anticipate and address these issues as they emerge. We are strongly supported by the OSU College of Medicine, the OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the OSU Center for Clinical and Translational Science.

project	5U2CCA233195-02	U2CCA233195	9791162	2019	The Cellular Geography of Therapeutic Resistance in Cancer	Grant	Most patients who die from cancer do so because their cancer is resistant to available therapies, either intrinsically, or as it evolves in response to treatment. However, the fundamental mechanisms driving resistance remain largely unknown. Tumors are comprised of a complex multicellular ecosystem of malignant and non- malignant cells, and changes in their composition, states, spatial organization and interactions are central to therapeutic resistance. Thus, there is an enormous need to chart an atlas of a tumor's cells, their spatial organization and interactions as those change dynamically in resistance to therapy. Technological breakthroughs in spatial and single-cell genomics, including many innovations by our team, now put an atlas within reach, but harnessing this remarkable opportunity, requires collection of multiple spatial and single cell genomics data in clinical samples; novel study design strategies; new experimental and computational strategies to integrate across cellular and spatial data; algorithms to construct tumor atlases that capture the resistant state; and showing how to use an atlas to formulate and test new predictive models of resistance. The Boston Human Tumor Atlas Network Research Center (HTA-RC) will address each of these challenges by creating three comprehensive atlases of the cellular geography of human cancer to understand how changes in the tumor ecosystem lead to therapeutic resistance in: (1) Primary and acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition in breast cancer; (2) Primary and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic melanoma; and (3) Primary resistance to immunotherapy in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinoma (CRC) compared with microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC. All three tumors types tackle an unmet clinical need; have an approximately equal rate of resistance and response to allow comparisons between states; and harness significant clinical experience and build on substantial preliminary results at our center. To construct the atlases, we will collect at least 100 biospecimens per year from resections and biopsies of the three tumor types and analyze them with histopathological data, high-resolution spatial multiplex RNA and protein data, single- cell genomics data, and temporal clinical data. Our algorithms will recover key features of each data modality, and integrate them into a single atlas to determine what predicts and underlies resistance. We build on a well-established interdisciplinary team in two major cancer centers (DFCI, MGH) and four research institutions (Broad, Harvard, Stanford, Princeton). Our leadership (Haining, Regev) and Units comprise of foremost experts and pioneers in clinical genomics (Biospecimens; Johnson, Wagle), spatial and single cell genomics (Shalek, Rozenblatt-Rosen, Nolan, Zhuang), and computational biology and data science (Regev, Van Allen, Engelhardt).

The OMS Atlas is motivated by the fact that these treatments typically are only transiently effective in the metastatic setting. Possible resistance mechanisms may be intrinsic to the tumor cells or derive from the diverse microenvironments in which the tumor cells live. The OMS Atlas will focus on elucidating these resistance mechanisms in three specific current generation clinical scenarios: (a) hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, (b) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and (c) castration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) undergoing treatment with enzalutamide. We will accomplish this through work in four areas. A Biospecimen Unit will prospectively collect, manage, and distribute longitudinal clinical information, blood, and biopsies from 20 patients from each of two metastatic breast cancer cohorts and one prostate cancer cohort that will be analyzed to create three OMS Atlases. The biopsies will be preserved to enable analyses using multiple characterization modalities. A Characterization Unit will analyze (a) OCT frozen specimens using Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) and Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing ATAC- seq (sci-ATAC-seq) to elucidate spatially defined genomic changes and chromatin accessibility in single cells, (b) formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to assess the immune microenvironment and cyclic Immunofluorescence (cycIF) to assess the composition and molecular states of tumor cells and their microenvironments, and (c) paraformaldehyde fixed, resin embedded (PFRE) specimens using a Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM) to identify ultrastructural changes in 2D images and targeted 3D images with 4-nm resolution. Omic characterization of the same tumor samples will be provided by the SMMART Program. A Data Analysis Unit will develop and deploy tools to (a) manage, analyze, and visualize Tier 1 data comprised of raw sequence data and images to generate unimodal Tier 2 results, (b) integrate omics and imaging data through crosswise mapping to create single timepoint tumor maps and quantify systems biological functions of tumor cellular subpopulations to generate Tier 3 results, and (c) explore differences between pre- and on/post-treatment tumor maps to reveal mechanisms of resistance that comprise Tier 4 results. We will collaborate with private sector partners to evaluate and adopt next generation technologies that increase analytical power and speed and reduce costs.

The OMS Atlas will focus on elucidating these resistance mechanisms in three specific current generation clinical scenarios: (a) hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, (b) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and (c) castration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) undergoing treatment with enzalutamide. We will accomplish this through work in four areas. A Biospecimen Unit will prospectively collect, manage, and distribute longitudinal clinical information, blood, and biopsies from 20 patients from each of two metastatic breast cancer cohorts and one prostate cancer cohort that will be analyzed to create three OMS Atlases. The biopsies will be preserved to enable analyses using multiple characterization modalities. A Characterization Unit will analyze (a) OCT frozen specimens using Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) and Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing ATAC- seq (sci-ATAC-seq) to elucidate spatially defined genomic changes and chromatin accessibility in single cells, (b) formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to assess the immune microenvironment and cyclic Immunofluorescence (cycIF) to assess the composition and molecular states of tumor cells and their microenvironments, and (c) paraformaldehyde fixed, resin embedded (PFRE) specimens using a Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM) to identify ultrastructural changes in 2D images and targeted 3D images with 4-nm resolution. Omic characterization of the same tumor samples will be provided by the SMMART Program. A Data Analysis Unit will develop and deploy tools to (a) manage, analyze, and visualize Tier 1 data comprised of raw sequence data and images to generate unimodal Tier 2 results, (b) integrate omics and imaging data through crosswise mapping to create single timepoint tumor maps and quantify systems biological functions of tumor cellular subpopulations to generate Tier 3 results, and (c) explore differences between pre- and on/post-treatment tumor maps to reveal mechanisms of resistance that comprise Tier 4 results. We will collaborate with private sector partners to evaluate and adopt next generation technologies that increase analytical power and speed and reduce costs. The Administrative Unit will facilitate the coordination, operation, interaction, and evaluation of activities within the OMS Atlas and between OMS Atlas scientists and the HTAN.	3-Dimensional;ATAC-seq;Adopted;Aftercare;Antigen Presentation;Area;Atlases;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;Blood;Blood specimen;CDK4 gene;Castration;Cells;Chemicals;Chromatin;Clinical;Collection;Computer software;Core Biopsy;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Diagnostic Procedure;Electron Microscope;Ensure;Evaluation;Event;Extracellular Matrix;Formalin;Freezing;Future;Generations;Genes;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Goals;Image;Image Analysis;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunohistochemistry;Immunomodulators;Ions;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Maps;Measurement;Mechanics;Metastatic breast cancer;Modality;Molecular;Paraffin Embedding;Pathway interactions;Patients;Periodicity;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Plant Resins;Primary Neoplasm;Private Sector;Procedures;Process;Production;Prostate Cancer therapy;Quality Control;Reproducibility;Resistance;Resolution;Sampling;Scanning;Scanning Electron Microscopy;Scientist;Signal Transduction;Specimen;Speed;Structure;System;Technology;Therapeutic;Three-Dimensional Image;Time;Tissue Preservation;Tissues;Tumor-Derived;Visualization;Visualization software;Work;base;biological systems;cancer cell;cohort;combinatorial;cost;drug efficacy;epigenomics;exhaustion;hormone receptor-positive;hormone therapy;immune checkpoint;immune resistance;indexing;individual patient;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant breast neoplasm;molecular imaging;multiple data types;nanoscale;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel diagnostics;novel therapeutic intervention;operation;paraform;preservation;programs;prospective;resistance mechanism;single cell sequencing;targeted treatment;tool;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions	OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY	PORTLAND	OR	UNITED STATES	Jeremy  Goecks,GORDON B.

project	5U2CCA233285-02	U2CCA233285	9791161	2019	Center for pediatric tumor cell atlas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL Childhood Cancer is the second most common causes of childhood deaths. Cancers in children are highly distinct from those in adults. Causes, mechanisms and therapeutic approaches cannot be extrapolated from the study of adult malignancies. To impact the burden of pediatric cancers requires the specific study of pediatric cancers. We therefore propose the in depth characterization of three specific subtypes of pediatric malignancies which, together, account for over 50% of all pediatric cancer deaths: high grade glioma (pHGG), high risk neuroblastoma (NB), and very high risk acute lymphoblastic B-cell precursor leukemia (VHR-ALL). All three tumor types share a characteristic of typically initial response to therapy, followed by the emergence of resistance and refractory disease. We will map molecular and cellular changes in tumor cells, microenvironment and the immune system using comprehensive multi-dimensional single-cell and in situ technologies associated with two critical transitions: initial response, and emergence of resistant disease – both high-priority transitions. Treatment modalities will include standard chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-) T cell therapy, capturing the cutting edge of current cancer therapy. The final product will impact global childhood cancer research in the following manner: 1) Tumor Atlases: atlases will provide a highly user friendly, publicly available, searchable database of the most comprehensive multi-omic, single cell analysis of the three most lethal childhood cancers. Molecular data will be richly annotated with access to additional pathological evaluation, clinical and outcomes data, and grant access to source data such tumor imaging. 2) Computational methods: in addition to the data, the critical computational tools and pipelines used in this project will be available to the research community. These include methods and pipelines for processing multi-omics and in situ data, inference of cancer phylogeny, inference of cell- and clone-specific pathways, methods for inferring cell-cell crosstalk, as well as database algorithms for the query, exploration and visualization of highly complex data. 3) Access to biospecimens for follow up studies: biospecimens collected in this project will be banked and made available to the biomedical research community. These include tissue sections, viably frozen specimen, and patient derived xenograft (PDX models). In summary, the proposed project will seek to address a major public health need in pediatrics, broadly impact the entire research community, and jumpstart target discovery based on a sophisticated understanding of the key molecular circuits that drive pediatric cancer.

project	5U2CCA233303-02	U2CCA233303	9788364	2019	Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract: Overall Diverse areas of cancer research have progressed to the point that it is now feasible to meaningfully integrate research data and clinical information across the molecular, cellular, and tissue realms into a larger, more detailed picture of the onco-dynamics of cancer, including spatial-temporal details during cancer treatment and progression. Physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the Siteman Cancer Center (WUSM-SCC) are longtime leaders in the allied sub-disciplines of cancer, including genomics, proteomics, imaging, functional characterization, pathology, clinical trials, and clinical care. WUSM- SCC is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, which sees ~9,000 new cancer patients annually. Building on our expertise, established infrastructure, large patient population, and extraordinary institutional commitment, we propose to develop the Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center (WU- HTARC) within the NIH Human Tumor Analysis Network (HTAN). We will focus on generating organ-specific human tumor atlases for three high priority cancer types associated with exceptionally poor prognosis: the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), glioblastoma (GBM), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Collectively, we will analyze ~1,600-2000 samples collected from spatially separated locations and at different time points along the clinical treatment course from 300-375 patients (selected from ~750 recruited patients) for the duration of the project. In addition to standard histopathological analyses, bulk DNA/RNA sequencing, proteomics, and clinical imaging, etc., we will conduct cutting-edge, comprehensive analyses, including single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), multiplexed immunofluorescent protein localization (MxIF), mass cytometry/Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF) cellular characterization, metabolomics analysis, innovative imaging, and 3-D modeling. We have established infrastructure covering the aforementioned areas, from specimen procurement (Biospecimen Unit), to multidisciplinary analyses modules (Characterization Unit), and to analysis pipelines (Data Analysis Unit). Data generated from this study will be valuable for revealing the clonal evolution of the tumor cells from longitudinally collected specimens and to reconstruct the tumor ecosystem involving non- cancer cells and acellular structures. Our atlases will have comprehensive data integration at the 3D level over time, providing unprecedented 4D models for the 3 selected cancer types. Our established infrastructure and continuous efforts in incorporating new technologies in omics, imaging, and informatics, will help ensure our atlases will be the state-of-the-art, taking full advantage of the latest progress in these fields and will continue to evolve beyond the pilot phase to facilitate cancer research and improve clinical care. The proposed atlases target a set of critically important clinical questions, including tumor resistance that has long been a challenge for GBM treatment and also an important clinical problem in BRCA/TNBC and PDAC, in which minority populations are disproportionately affected. Other emphases are BRCA response/resistance to chemotherapy, PDAC metastasis, and GBM local recurrence in conjunction with resistance to therapy. These atlases can cross reference each other for pan-cancer analyses. We will also seek to cooperate with any Pre- Cancer Atlas (PCA) centers studying these disease types to maximize the temporal continuity of research on these cancers. The similarities and differences among the three selected cancer types will provide synergy among the three atlases and will also allow us to accumulate valuable knowledge in atlas building for other cancer types.

Physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the Siteman Cancer Center (WUSM-SCC) are longtime leaders in the allied sub-disciplines of cancer, including genomics, proteomics, imaging, functional characterization, pathology, clinical trials, and clinical care. WUSM- SCC is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, which sees ~9,000 new cancer patients annually. Building on our expertise, established infrastructure, large patient population, and extraordinary institutional commitment, we propose to develop the Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center (WU- HTARC) within the NIH Human Tumor Analysis Network (HTAN). We will focus on generating organ-specific human tumor atlases for three high priority cancer types associated with exceptionally poor prognosis: the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), glioblastoma (GBM), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Collectively, we will analyze ~1,600-2000 samples collected from spatially separated locations and at different time points along the clinical treatment course from 300-375 patients (selected from ~750 recruited patients) for the duration of the project. In addition to standard histopathological analyses, bulk DNA/RNA sequencing, proteomics, and clinical imaging, etc., we will conduct cutting-edge, comprehensive analyses, including single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), multiplexed immunofluorescent protein localization (MxIF), mass cytometry/Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF) cellular characterization, metabolomics analysis, innovative imaging, and 3-D modeling. We have established infrastructure covering the aforementioned areas, from specimen procurement (Biospecimen Unit), to multidisciplinary analyses modules (Characterization Unit), and to analysis pipelines (Data Analysis Unit). Data generated from this study will be valuable for revealing the clonal evolution of the tumor cells from longitudinally collected specimens and to reconstruct the tumor ecosystem involving non- cancer cells and acellular structures. Our atlases will have comprehensive data integration at the 3D level over time, providing unprecedented 4D models for the 3 selected cancer types. Our established infrastructure and continuous efforts in incorporating new technologies in omics, imaging, and informatics, will help ensure our atlases will be the state-of-the-art, taking full advantage of the latest progress in these fields and will continue to evolve beyond the pilot phase to facilitate cancer research and improve clinical care. The proposed atlases target a set of critically important clinical questions, including tumor resistance that has long been a challenge for GBM treatment and also an important clinical problem in BRCA/TNBC and PDAC, in which minority populations are disproportionately affected. Other emphases are BRCA response/resistance to chemotherapy, PDAC metastasis, and GBM local recurrence in conjunction with resistance to therapy. These atlases can cross reference each other for pan-cancer analyses. We will also seek to cooperate with any Pre- Cancer Atlas (PCA) centers studying these disease types to maximize the temporal continuity of research on these cancers. The similarities and differences among the three selected cancer types will provide synergy among the three atlases and will also allow us to accumulate valuable knowledge in atlas building for other cancer types. The data, specimens, and experience gained by our center will be shared with HTAN and the broader research community to foster the next important discoveries in personalized cancer medicine.	3-Dimensional;Affect;Anatomy;Archives;Area;Atlases;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;Cancer Biology;Cancer Center;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cataloging;Catalogs;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Clonal Evolution;Clonality;Collaborations;Communities;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Cytometry;DNA;Data;Data Analyses;Data Set;Dimensions;Discipline;Disease;Drug resistance;Ecosystem;Ensure;Evolution;FAIR principles;Fostering;Foundations;Future;Generations;Genes;Genome;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Goals;Histopathology;Human;Image;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Individual;Infrastructure;Institutes;Knowledge;Link;Location;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medicine;Methodology;Minority;Modeling;Molecular;Mutate;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organ;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathology;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Physicians;Pilot Projects;Population;Positron-Emission Tomography;Process;Proteins;Proteome;Proteomics;Recurrence;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Sampling;Series;Site;Slice;Solid Neoplasm;Spatial Distribution;Specimen;Structure;Time;Tissues;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Validation;Washington;analysis pipeline;anticancer research;biomarker discovery;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell type;chemotherapy;clinical application;clinical care;clinical imaging;cohesion;data integration;density;diverse data;drug development;exome sequencing;experience;genome sequencing;imaging informatics;improved;in vivo;innovation;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;malignant breast neoplasm;medical schools;metabolome;metabolomics;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;new technology;new therapeutic target;outcome forecast;patient population;relational database;response;single-cell RNA sequencing;synergism;therapeutic development;therapy resistant;three dimensional structure;three-dimensional modeling;tool;transcriptome sequencing;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor progression;whole genome	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	SAINT LOUIS	MO	UNITED STATES	Samuel  Achilefu,Li  Ding,Ryan C Fields,William E.

There has been a failure to improve survival rates or decrease treatment-related morbidity in OS/LMS due to insufficient characterization of the genomic landscape, resulting in a lack of targeted therapeutic approaches, diagnostic methods, and preventive strategies. There is an urgent need for a large, shared database of clinical and genomic data in OS and LMS. Yet, because of the rarity of these tumor types as well as other challenges in patient recruitment and the genomic characterization of these tumors, to date it has been difficult to generate this data. The overarching goal of this proposal is to engage adult and pediatric participants with OS and LMS as partners to generate a shared database of clinical, genomic, molecular, and patient-reported data. This should accelerate discoveries that drive novel treatment strategies, new clinical trials, and new standards of care. The Count Me In PE-CGS U2C Research Center will leverage our experience in patient engagement, genome characterization, computational analysis, and behavioral research to create and launch two patient-partnered projects to generate this clinicogenomic data. We will build two websites with patients in the OS and LMS communities—the Osteosarcoma Project (OSproject) and the Leiomyosarcoma Project (LMSproject)—and consent 3,000 patients over the course of the study. We will collect medical records, patient-reported data, archival tumor tissue samples, and saliva and blood for genomic analysis. We will generate clinically annotated genomic data from at least 750 tumor specimens, 500 circulating tumor DNA specimens, and corresponding germline specimens and share the de-identified data widely. At the same time, we will study and optimize the approach to patient engagement in cancer research, particularly among rural and minority participants and participants across a range of literacy levels, ages, and stages in development. To accomplish these goals, we will build on a well-established interdisciplinary team from the Broad Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with members who have pioneered these approaches. Our leadership (Wagle, Janeway) and Units are comprised of experts in patient-partnered cancer research (Wagle, Painter), sarcoma clinical and translational research (Janeway, George, Crompton, Raut), genome characterization, analysis, and clinical interpretation (Gabriel, Getz, Van Allen, Wagle, Janeway), computational biology/data science (Getz, Van Allen, Philippakis), and behavioral science (Mack, Rebbeck). Our Center will uncover the key clinicogenomic features of OS/LMS, integrate them into a single comprehensive database with a goal of accelerating research and improving the lives of these patients. In doing so, we also aim to present a general approach to patient-partnered research that can be disseminated broadly and applied to other tumors types and patient communities.

To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity.

These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer	Address;Behavior;Biological Models;Biological Pharmacology;Biological Process;Breast;Cancer Patient;Cells;Chemoresistance;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Clonal Evolution;Clonality;Collection;Communities;Community Outreach;Complex;DNA;Data;Development;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;Education and Outreach;Educational Activities;Evolution;Faculty;Gene Expression Profile;Generations;Genetic;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Heterogeneity;Individual;Infrastructure;Institutes;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Mathematics;Measures;Methodology;Modeling;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Ovarian;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Pharmacology Study;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Population Dynamics;Population Heterogeneity;Postdoctoral Fellow;Prevention program;Regimen;Research;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Resources;Sampling;Science;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid;Somatic Mutation;System;Systems Analysis;Systems Biology;Testing;Therapeutic;Translations;Variant;base;cancer cell;cohort;computational pipelines;computerized tools;data sharing;data tools;dynamic system;effective therapy;experimental study;improved;innovation;knowledge base;malignant breast neoplasm;member;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel drug combination;outreach program;personalized cancer therapy;predictive modeling;pressure;prevent;programs;refractory cancer;student training;synergism;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tool;transcriptomics;treatment response;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment	BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE	DUARTE	CA	UNITED STATES	ANDREA Hope BILD	DCB	HANNAH RUTH Dueck	2195349	>=$1M	2195349	15-Jun-2021	15-May-2017	30-Jun-2023	RFA-CA-15-014	Moonshot

Despite improvements in the clinical outcomes achieved with newer therapies, wide inter-individual variation in response to treatment is a major limitation in achieving consistent therapeutic effects, or cures. Not all patients respond to initial therapies (innate resistance), and those that do frequently relapse with refractory disease (acquired resistance). The central hypothesis we are addressing is that rational therapeutic development in MM should be based on an understanding of the underlying genetics and biology of the tumor that identify sensitivity and resistance to current and future drugs. In this Myeloma-DRSC we are proposing 3 Projects that will: 1) develop a high throughput drug screening platform for myeloma cell lines representing the wide diversity of MM biology; and use this platform to screen primary patient tumor cells for most effective responses, including combination therapies; 2) develop a comprehensive mutational and germline variation panel that will be correlated to drug responses in vitro and in vivo, as well as toxicities; 3) identify the mechanism of response and resistance for two of the most common therapeutics used in MM treatment: IMiDS and proteasome inhibitors; 4) develop genetic and immunophenotypic signatures that effectively predict tumor response, resistance, and patient toxicities; 5) identify tumor sub-populations that may contribute to emerging resistance; and 6) identify strategies to predict drug resistance and approaches to overcome resistance.

Treatment strategies for AML have not changed in 30-40 years. Single-agent targeted therapies based on AML genetics or microenvironmental disease features have been disappointing, at best. The investigators on this DRSC Program, Drug Combinations to Circumvent Resistance (D2CR), have collaborated for over a decade and have developed functional genomic pipelines for evaluation of primary AML patient samples that have collectively led to numerous discoveries with diagnostic and therapeutic implications. For this Program, our long-term goals are to translate effective drug combinations that target tumor- intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways into the clinic for patients with AML. Our immediate goals are to prioritize the most relevant tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways for each AML disease subset and establish sufficient preclinical data to facilitate immediate clinical investigation of drug combinations. Based on the central hypothesis that drug combinations targeting tumor intrinsic and extrinsic features of AML biology will be essential to the development of more effective and durable therapeutic strategies, we predict that the drug combinations established by this D2CR-DRSC Program will substantially improve outcomes for patients with AML. To accomplish these goals, 3 Projects are proposed: 1) What are the tumor-intrinsic genes and pathways that contribute to drug sensitivity and resistance? Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screens on parental and drug-resistant AML cells will be integrated with computational analysis of the largest functional genomic AML cohort in the world. The result will nominate genes/pathways for validation on patient samples in gene-edited models and for drug combination studies in Project 3. 2) What are the tumor-extrinsic pathways promoting tumor cell growth, drug resistance, and immune suppression? Inflammatory cytokine profiling of our large bank of AML patient samples will be conducted. Our bank of AML patient bone marrow stromal cells will also be accessed for studies of the reactive signature of these stromal cells when exposed to specific drugs. Finally, high-parameter immunophenotyping and T-cell functional assays will be used to define the immune landscape with candidate drugs tested in an immune-competent, spontaneous mouse model of AML. Candidate targets will be nominated for combination studies with tumor-intrinsic targets. 3) What are the drug combinations that most effectively bridge tumor- intrinsic and microenvironmental biology to eliminate AML cells and circumvent resistance? Drug combinations from targets nominated in Project 1 and 2 will be tested ex vivo on primary AML patient samples and in vivo using AML patient-derived xenografts. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a major impact on our understanding of AML biology, with successful clinical translation of new, more effective drug combination strategies.

project	5U54CA224065-03	U54CA224065	10009286	2020	University of Texas PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	SUMMARY Our overarching goal for the University Texas PDX Development and Trial Center (UTPDTC) is to optimize personalized biomarker-based cancer therapy and identify effective targeted drugs based on the molecular characteristics of each tumor. Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly- annotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The primary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single agents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs or combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets of tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other histologies. Over the past 9 years, both University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDACC) and The University of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) have established institution-wide efforts to generate novel PDX models and perform preclinical testing. Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX models of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases where there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We have characterized many tumor subtypes in our existing PDXs and plan to characterize many more with the ultimate goal of developing drug combinations in defined tumor subsets in a context that can lead to clinical trials which will validate the experimental results. We plan to focus on NCI-IND agents that are primarily used by the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network. The availability of hundreds of PDXs of diverse histologic types and molecular profiles provides a unique opportunity for synergistic interactions among the UTPDTC investigators, PDXNet, and ETCTN. Each Project will identify molecular subtypes and then test with drugs targeted to putative pathways. Similar molecular subtype profiles will be identified across projects and histologic classifications. This provides an opportunity to test the activity of drugs targeting specific molecular pathways that may be active in several histologically distinct subtypes. Such pan-histologic activity could greatly accelerate drug development. Our proposed studies focus on targeted therapeutic agents for treatment of diseases and/or molecular subtypes that have unmet medical needs. The proposed studies are highly relevant to public health, as their success will lead to effective precision therapy for cancers, for which current therapies are ineffective.

Due to the size and complexity of this challenge, we believe a collaborative team approach is critical and have assembled a team of drug resistance experts from three leading institutions (MGH, the Broad Institute, and MIT/Koch Institute) with an exceptional track record of impactful discoveries in this field. We propose an integrated full-spectrum translational platform—including liquid biopsy, patient-derived tumor models, exome and transcriptome sequencing of tumor tissue, rapid autopsy, functional genomic screens, innovative preclinical mouse models, and a high-throughput combination drug-screening platform covering the CTEP portfolio—to address critical principles of drug resistance across several major cancer types—lung, melanoma and GI cancers, which impact a large percentage of cancer patients. Overall, these three projects will focus on the common theme of bypass resistance mechanisms, a critical ad frequent mechanism of therapeutic resistance that can involve both genetic and adaptive resistance mechanisms that “bypass” the effects of therapy, and which can drive both intrinsic and acquired resistance. To maximize the potential impact on cancer patients we will focus projects on three major tumor types—lung, melanoma and GI cancers—with each project integrating at least two tumor types. We will focus our projects on defining and overcoming key bypass resistance mechanisms to three of the most critical classes of cancer therapeutics: MAPK inhibitors, RTK inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. While each project will focus on a specific therapy and at least two specific cancer types, we believe the overall program design can be readily applied to additional agents and molecularly-defined cancers, such that the ultimate impact of this work will go beyond the specific studies proposed and will serve as a “blueprint” for critical discoveries related to drug resistance. We anticipate that these efforts will define a new standard in our mechanistic understanding of bypass resistance mechanisms and will lead to novel opportunities to overcome them in the clinic. Our proposed approach will provide a steady stream of novel therapeutic strategies involving CTEP agents and pathways for evaluation in future clinical trials, as well as new potential agents for the CTEP portfolio. We have also integrated cutting-edge strategies for real-time blood-based monitoring of response and resistance to help guide innovative trial design.

In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens have been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas. These treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof- of-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will progress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been shown to be effective in patients with a wild-type BRAF. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments that prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are effective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies, over the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical, histological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of >450 PDX models represents one of the largest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately recapituluates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also includes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been maintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a robust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we propose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued expansion of our robutst melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical gaps in this disease. Project 1 will characterize kinase inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the PI3K-AKT pathway in combination with approved targeted therapies in PDX models in treatment-naïve and drug- resistant BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanomas. Project 2 will characterize targeting the apoptotic machinery of cancer cells as a combinatorial approach with MAPK pathway inhibitors in PDX with and without BRAFV600E/K mutations, including in subsets with aberrancies in anti-apoptotic genes. Both Projects will utilize baseline characteristics of the PDX models to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to guide personalized patient selection for future clinical testing. In addition, tumors will be analyzed for treatment-induced effects that correlate with sensitivity to identified resistance mechanisms and potential new combinatorial strategies. Finally, markers identified in the preclinical models will be compared to parallel biomarker studies of metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in clinical trials utilizing the same agents. These studies will be supported by the PDX, Bioinformatics, and Administrative Cores to ensure their success, along with a Pilot Project program to open new areas of investigation. Together these studies will have high potential to translate into new personalized clinical trials for patients.

project	5U54CA224076-03	U54CA224076	10005183	2020	PDX Trial Center for Breast Cancer Therapy	Grant	Project Summary The scientific premise of this Center is that breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models represent the diversity of human breast tumors, and can be feasibly utilized to test new drugs and drug combinations to find therapeutic approaches that match with molecular features of various tumor types. The goal of our PDX Development and Trials Center (PDTC) is to obtain preclinical data that will facilitate prioritization of drugs to be tested in breast cancer clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Toward this goal, our PDTC focuses on testing drugs that are already available through the NCI as NCI-IND agents with the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). Scientifically, this PDTC will focus on preclinical evaluation of approved and investigational drugs and drug combinations in a large collection of breast PDX models representing primary and metastatic breast cancer. One project will screen 35 NCI-IND drugs as single agents and in combination with standard- of-care therapies, in >100 breast PDX models using a novel organoid system, and validate these responses in PDX-bearing mice. Another project will test therapies that are predicted to target tumor- initiating cell populations, with the goal of reducing chemotherapy resistance and recurrence – the major cause of death from breast cancer. These two synergistic research projects will be supported several key Cores: a PDX Core to propagate the PDX models and run the drug studies; a Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core to identify molecular features of tumors that do (or do not) respond to various treatments; a Pilot Projects and Trans-network Activities Core to foster exploration of new ideas within the PDTC and in collaboration with the PDXNetwork (PDXNet); and an Administrative Core to facilitate effective communication within the PDTC and with the PDXNet. Taken together, these elements will converge to reveal high-priority treatment strategies for future clinical trials in breast cancer patients.

project	5U54CA224079-03	U54CA224079	10005184	2020	The MSKCC-UW/Fred Hutch Prostate Cancer Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center	Grant	OVERALL ABSTRACT The lethal stage of metastatic prostate cancer, called castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), kills ~26,000 men per year in the US. Despite remarkable improvements in survival with next generation AR pathway inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, CRPC patients ultimately progress and die from their disease. Our understanding of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to AR therapy has increased dramatically in recent years, largely based on genomic landscape analyses of tumors from CRPC patients and preclinical studies of acquired resistance in patient-derived models (organoids, PDX). Much of this progress is directly linked to the members of this Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center (DRSC) team. A major mechanistic insight from these studies is the recognition of two categories of AR therapy resistance: one in which AR pathway signaling is restored and the other in which it remains inhibited. Underlying both categories are a heterogeneous set of resistance mechanisms, many of which were discovered by our DRSC team members. Importantly, we have shown that several of these resistance mechanisms can be targeted with current clinical grade drugs. The overarching goal of this DRSC proposal is to evaluate these translational opportunities across a unique set of preclinical organoid and PDX models (again, discovered and developed by our DRSC team members) and to catalyze the initiation of clinical studies in patients most likely to benefit based on appropriate biomarker profiles. We address this goal in three Projects. Project 1 focuses on resistance caused by restored AR pathway function, which occurs in over ~50% of CRPC patients, by targeting the glucocorticoid receptor, which is upregulated and substitutes for AR, or by further inhibition of AR signaling using drugs targeting specific components of the chromatin machinery. Project 2 will take a similar approach but will focus on the opposite category of acquired resistance (absence of restored AR pathway activity), leveraging insights from our recent data showing that cancer can revert from an AR-negative to AR-positive state by targeting specific chromatin modifiers. Project 3 integrates with Projects 1 and 2 by focusing on kinase inhibitors as an adjunct to AR pathway therapy in two distinct contexts – PI3K/AKT activation in tumors with PTEN loss and FGFR activation in tumors with autocrine FGF8/FGF9 production. Excitingly, a recent clinical trial of combined AKT and AR inhibition, which was initiated based on our earlier work, demonstrated a significant improvement in survival for patients with PTEN loss prostate cancer. The Administrative Core will oversee the integration of the Projects with each other, with NCI scientific staff and with other DRSCs. Collectively our studies will validate various combination therapy regimens, in conjunction with molecular biomarkers for patient selection, as a critical step toward clinical translation. In addition, the drugs and targets studied here are broadly relevant for multiple cancer types.

This translational approach will be part of the NCI's Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Centers Network to develop innovative strategies to understand and combat mechanisms of tumor resistance and exploit tumor sensitivity to anti-cancer therapies.  To accomplish this, BATAR-UP will support two projects and one core driven by a multidisciplinary team of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University. Project 1 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of residual disease in lung cancers treated with targeted inhibitors in clinical use. We will prioritize for initial study both EGFR-mutant and ALK gene rearrangement positive lung cancers, given their importance as key molecular disease subtypes and our prior published work and expertise. We will harness genetic and transcriptomic analysis of clinical samples (liquid and tumor biopsies) to provide a molecular view of the evolution of response, residual disease, and acquired resistance. We will generate organoid and PDX models and apply cutting-edge functional screens (genetic, pharmacologic, and targeted proteomic assays) to identify key vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited, including with CTEP agents. This systematic approach will allow us to reveal the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that drives EGFR and ALK inhibitor resistance and pinpoint therapeutic strategies to intercept the evolution of residual disease and eventual acquired resistance. Project 2 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of resistance and residual disease in lung cancers treated with current immunotherapies, including PD-1 and PD- L1 antibodies. Leveraging shared platforms in synergy with Project 1, we will perform systematic analyses of liquid and tumor biopsy specimens (and ex vivo models) obtained from patients longitudinally before and during treatment and upon acquired resistance. We will focus our studies on EGFR and ALK wild type patients, including squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma patients where immunotherapy has shown efficacy but is typically non-curative. We will leverage (1) a novel lung cancer organoid model wherein tumor biopsies are cultured as both tumor epithelium and their endogenous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) en bloc as a cohesive unit, and (2) deep droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Our systematic approach will help define the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that contributes to immunotherapy resistance and identify potential new therapeutic strategies to help convert these incomplete responses into curative outcomes. Our Administrative Core will provide leadership, coordination and oversight for BATAR-UP with the overarching goal of synergizing the research conducted in the 2 Projects and the entire DRSC network.

Recognizing the unique advantage of the patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) models in drug testing and personalized medicine, physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the Siteman Cancer Center have been actively generating and utilizing PDX models for cancer research and the evaluation of molecularly targeted agents. Building on our strength and existing infrastructure, we propose to establish the Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center (WU-PDTC), as part of PDXNet program, to promote preclinical testing in a collaborative nation-wide effort. The PDX core within WU-PDTC will develop and characterize at least 1000 new pathogen-free PDX models across major tumor types. The PDX models will be genomically and phenotypically characterized using the latest ‘omics technologies and expertly analyzed using the most current data analysis pipelines that have been deployed for other large scale NCI programs. The Bioinformatics Core will integrate these analyzes with clinical annotation from the originating patient to include patient treatment history and tumor response (Aim 1). Our two research projects will conduct PDX clinical trials using single agent and combinational agents using drugs under NCI-IND (Aim 2). Project 1 will test pan- or beta isoform specific class I PI3K inhibitors in over 100 breast PDX models while Project 2 will study combinatorial approaches that overcome tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms to ERK inhibition in over 100 already available pancreatic PDX models. Proteogenomic and clinical response data will be collected in these models, as part of a broader effort of characterizing PDX models and conducting clinical correlation and treatment response analyses by the Bioinformatics Core (Aim 3). All relevant information, including proteogenomic features of PDX models and treatment/response history, will be tracked in a dedicated relational database that will be accessible to PDXNet and PDMR-FNLCR. The goal is to identify candidates for human clinical trials for the ET-CTN. In Aim 4, the WU-PDTC will leverage existing expertise and programs from the NCI-designated Comprehensive Siteman Cancer Center, Institute of Clinical and Translational Research (ITCS), McDonnell Genome Institute, Mallinkrodt Imaging Research Center, and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN) to support the goals of developing and utilizing PDX models to test and improve cancer treatment, in collaboration with other components of the PDXNet. Finally, WU-PDTC, through coordination by the Administration Core, will support pilot research projects utilizing the PDX resources and fostering collaboration across PDTCs, PNMR-FNLCR, and other NCI programs. The goal is to increase the spectrum of agents tested in PDX clinical trials and to improve the reliability, validation, utility, and standardization of PDX models through innovative Cross-PDXNet research. Our demonstrated capability in generating and utilizing PDX models, extensive existing infrastructure, and strong institutional commitment set a solid foundation for a successful PDTC that will help achieve goals set by NCI in advancing the use of PDX models in preclinical testing.

Among patients with NF1, loss of the non-mutant allele of NF1 in a rare Schwann cell or precursor, along with other ill-defined factors, leads to benign dermal or plexiform neurofibromas. The main cause of death among NF1 patients is the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most likely develops from plexiform neurofibroma, in particular the so-called “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma. Approximately half of MPNSTs are NF1-associated, and NF1 patients have 10-15% lifetime risk of developing this terrible cancer. MPNSTs metastasize early and are often resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main treatment for MPNSTs is surgical resection but, despite radical excision with wide surgical margins, followed by chemoradiation, 5-year survival rates are poor due to metastases as well as local recurrence. NF1 patients could greatly benefit from prophylactic vaccination that would prevent the malignant transformation of benign plexiform neurofibromas into “atypical” plexiform neurofibromas and to MPNSTs. We aim to determine if the mutations that govern the development of “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma (NF1 loss followed by CDKN2A loss) and MPSNT (NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12 loss) lead to the expression of recurrent alternately processed transcripts, such as transcriptionally-induced chimeras, that could express neoantigens and be used as targets for prophylactic vaccines. Such transcripts can be translated to produce novel peptides downstream of frameshift mutations caused by coding exon read-through into introns, mis-splicing from a coding exon to a non-canonical splice acceptors or splice acceptors in other genes. In most cases, a premature termination codon (PTC) will be rapidly encountered by the ribosome translating such transcripts. Therefore, we furthermore hypothesize that these alternately processed transcripts can express what we call “cryptic” neoantigens when treated with drugs that suppress utilization of premature codons such as Ataluren or gentamycin. In such a way, we could administer a prophylactic vaccine and induce conditionally active immune response that would eliminate nascent tumors only when drug treatment is used.

project	5UG3CA244697-02	UG3CA244697	10024065	2020	Intercepting progression from pre-invasive to invasive lung adenocarcinoma	Grant	Abstract Despite advances in therapeutic strategies, non-small cell lung cancer remains a deadly disease. An improved understanding of the biology of lung cancer is needed to intercept the disease at an early point in its progression. Our project, which is inspired by that challenge, focuses on events transpiring in the earliest radiographically-detected manifestation of lung cancer: the computerized tomography (CT)-detected non- solid nodule, of which as many as 40% harbor frankly invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, despite conventional wisdom that CT-detected non-solid nodules represent pre or minimally invasive malignancy, clearly transition to more invasive histologies occurs in a significant proportion of these nodules. Understanding the cellular and molecular changes within non-solid nodules that drive progression will provide unique and novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that alterations in cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a role in initiating and supporting this progression. In agreement with that proposal, our preliminary multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) studies suggest that progression to a more invasive phenotype is associated with the development of a strong immunosuppressive TME. In this project we test our hypothesis using multidimensional methods to profile the TME and to determine the crosstalk between cancer cells and the TME in pre-invasive to invasive human lung non-solid adenocarcinomas. Comparative analysis of the cellular and molecular events associated with the distinct histological stages will lead to identification of the critical events triggering progression and thereby identify targets to intercept disease progression. We will use appropriate mouse models in pre-clinical studies to develop these targets as strategies to intercept progression of pre-invasive to invasive cancer. In the first phase of these studies (UG3 phase), we will define TME alterations associated with progression of lung nodules using RNAseq profiling and image-based methods (multiplex IF and imaging CyTOF) in studies of our archival tumor samples. These studies will generate a comprehensive catalogue of the cellular and molecular events that trigger progression of indolent lesions to frankly invasive cancers, with a strong focus on immune mechanisms. These analyses will provide novel and detailed insights into how the composition and activity of the TME changes with progression. In the second phase (UH3 phase), we will leverage mouse models to explore interception strategies to target immune mechanisms and prevent progression. The proposed cohort satisfies the RFA’s focus on High-Risk Cohorts for Cancer-Immunoprevention Studies, since lung nodules are premalignancies highly prevalent in smokers.

While repeated screening through frequent use of the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear has drastically reduced the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in developed nations, the vast majority of cervical cancer-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries with minimal healthcare infrastructure. Cytology-based prevention programs have proven to be extremely difficult to implement and sustain in low-resource settings, and as a result over 85% of new cervical cancer cases originate in developing countries. The lack of adequate infrastructure for traditional cytology-based screening combined with the presentation of cervical cancer, where symptoms are not present until the cancer is in an advanced stage, emphasize the clinical need for a screening test appropriate for low resource settings. Development of a reliable Point-of-Care (POC) test with high sensitivity and specificity has the ability to reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer worldwide. We propose to develop a novel nanotechnology- based diagnostic assay platform to detect cervical cancer progression in low-resource settings. This multiplex assay platform, which is currently being developed for non-oncology applications by Becton Dickinson (BD), is designed to be low-cost, easy to use, and inexpensive. We propose to adapt this platform to develop a highly specific diagnostic test that will screen women who do not need treatment and identify women with cervical lesions who need to be referred for colposcopy. The diagnostic test is based on Surfaced Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) technology, that enables detection of multiple targets in a complex sample without the need for washing or purification. The test and analysis is completed in less than 30 minutes, provides a "sample-in- answer-out" workflow, making the platform ideal for a "screen and treat" test in low-resource settings. Diagnostic development and validation will be done in close collaboration with a multidisciplinary team with expertise in HPV and cervical cancer screening as well as clinical oncology. By combining BD's experience in assay development, global healthcare delivery, and regulatory approval with the clinical expertise of other team members, the team has the expertise required to develop and validate a POC cervical cancer test for low resource settings. In addition to BD assay development, engineering, global healthcare delivery, and regulatory personnel, the team includes Dr. Jennifer S.

project	5UH3CA233229-03	UH3CA233229	10020342	2020	ACCISIS-Chicago	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) not only detects disease early but also prevents cancer by finding and removing precancerous polyps. The overall goal of our project, Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-up through Implementation Science in Chicago (ACCSIS-Chicago), is to test a multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in Chicago, Illinois. In this project, we will include two different types of implementation strategies: 1) evidence-based multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care; and 2) implementation support strategies to support the implementation process that contribute to the adoption, implementation and sustainment of our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention. We will partner with 4 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which have 35 clinics in the Chicago area and provided primary care service to nearly 188,000 racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in 2016. During the UG3 Planning-Exploratory Phase, we will work with one of the 4 FQHC partners to pilot test, measure, and refine our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention in preparation for the experimental trial in the UH3 Implementation Phase, as well as assess the effectiveness of our implementation support strategies. In the UH3 Implementation Phase, we will use a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and impact of our multilevel, multicomponent intervention on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care across our 4 partner FQHCs. The selection of our intervention components will be based on intensive literature review, and findings and lessons learned from our previous studies and projects. Our multilevel intervention components will include EMR provider reminders, provider assessment and feedback, patient navigation, provider education and community outreach. We will also test one local innovation, IL ColonCARES, during the UGH Phase to increase the rate of follow-up after a positive stool test among uninsured patients by linking uninsured patients with specialty services. We expect the finding from this study to have broad impact on understanding the implementation process to increase colorectal cancer screening, follow up, and referral to care across diverse health systems.

project	5UH3CA233229-04	UH3CA233229	10231157	2021	ACCISIS-Chicago	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY Screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) not only detects disease early but also prevents cancer by finding and removing precancerous polyps. The overall goal of our project, Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-up through Implementation Science in Chicago (ACCSIS-Chicago), is to test a multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in Chicago, Illinois. In this project, we will include two different types of implementation strategies: 1) evidence-based multilevel, multicomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care; and 2) implementation support strategies to support the implementation process that contribute to the adoption, implementation and sustainment of our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention. We will partner with 4 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), which have 35 clinics in the Chicago area and provided primary care service to nearly 188,000 racial/ethnic minority and low income populations in 2016. During the UG3 Planning-Exploratory Phase, we will work with one of the 4 FQHC partners to pilot test, measure, and refine our proposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention in preparation for the experimental trial in the UH3 Implementation Phase, as well as assess the effectiveness of our implementation support strategies. In the UH3 Implementation Phase, we will use a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and impact of our multilevel, multicomponent intervention on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care across our 4 partner FQHCs. The selection of our intervention components will be based on intensive literature review, and findings and lessons learned from our previous studies and projects. Our multilevel intervention components will include EMR provider reminders, provider assessment and feedback, patient navigation, provider education and community outreach. We will also test one local innovation, IL ColonCARES, during the UGH Phase to increase the rate of follow-up after a positive stool test among uninsured patients by linking uninsured patients with specialty services. We expect the finding from this study to have broad impact on understanding the implementation process to increase colorectal cancer screening, follow up, and referral to care across diverse health systems.

In North Carolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions. Community health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable populations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%. Substantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and system-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening targets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based screening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase screening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to systematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for uninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from stakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We hypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective approaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through improved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research, implementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central hypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based interventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable. The specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot studies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a process for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2 (Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening approaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess implementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the multilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This project is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation modeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact on CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities.

Specifically, the Appalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern Kentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the area are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents screened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence on CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with Appalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention and control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted from evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the community (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in 12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base for a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically underserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden of CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test, measure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH and Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI approval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI in a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2) Assess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with community and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to early or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined by US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county- level behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating Center, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community partners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia.

Grant	Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality. The US  Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends CRC screening through a variety of invasive and non-invasive  tests for individuals aged 50 to 75 years. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and other strategies  exist to promote CRC screening, but adoption and implementation of these are limited, especially in CHCs.  Our hypothesis is that a Hub and Spoke multilevel intervention will be superior to usual care. The hub will be  Health Quality Partners of Southern California (HQP), a non-profit organization comprised of 16 CHC systems  (spokes), serving 135 rural and urban clinic sites. We propose a 2-phase study to pilot and optimize (Phase I)  and rigorously test (Phase II) the Hub and Spoke approach and its impact on CRC screening, follow-up, and  usual care. UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary  outcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed  methods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients  served by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and  coordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3  Implementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a  regionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care  among CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability  Model (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,  Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness of the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post  implementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3)  proportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and  sustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods  approach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM  constructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e.  patients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and  Sustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of  Implementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate  progress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are  scalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.

Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up colonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage partnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest Center for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation support to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate working with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics (reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients). In Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a large-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor supported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never been screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to support follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and recruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the training and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings. In Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi- experimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice facilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan- vendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never been screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred for colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will evaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and qualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program through partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care clinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model.

project	5UM1CA154967-08	UM1CA154967	9568709	2018	Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network Central Operations and Statistical Center	Grant	Project Summary The Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN) came about from discussions at the 2007 NCI Immunotherapy Agent Workshop, in which high-priority agents were identified that showed the potential to benefit patients with cancer—but that were not yet broadly available for investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Since 2007, a sea change has occurred in the field of cancer immunotherapy, resulting from the success of anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1. However, most of the priority agents identified in the NCI Workshop are still not broadly available for academic IITs. Since the original award in 2011, the CITN focused on testing these high-priority agents, including 5 of the top 8 ranked agents that hit targets critical for optimal immune responses. CITN trials are among the few academic IITs of these agents, and each trial has defined biologic and therapeutic principles. Two trials have led to changes in clinical practice. The abbreviated Specific Aims for the CITN are as follows: Aim 1: (a) to continue to conduct innovative early phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for adult cancers using high-priority immunomodulatory agents; (b) to form a Pediatric CITN (PedCITN) to conduct innovative early phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for pediatric cancers using high-priority immunomodulatory agents; (c) to provide leadership, infrastructure, and statistical support for the conduct of these clinical trials; (d) to continue to access high-priority agents central to immune responses and not broadly available for IITs Aim 2: to coordinate studies with Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) and other labs for specimen analysis (immune monitoring, biomarker credentialing) of adult and pediatric patients on CITN trials Scientific Goals of the CITN 1. Continue trials with T cell and natural killer cell activator and growth factor IL-15, homeostatic T cell growth  factor IL-7, dendritic cell activator anti-CD40, dendritic cell growth factor Flt3L, and IDO inhibitor ± anti-PD1 2. Continue trials with anti-PD1 for orphan and ultra-orphan indications, including pediatric cancers 3.

In particular, non- neuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an aggressive form of this disease, is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The main barriers against therapeutic advances are a paucity of relevant disease models and a very poor understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to this phenotype. The process of protein synthesis has long been considered subordinate to alterations at the levels of DNA and RNA in cancer etiology. However, work from our laboratory and others have revealed that protein synthesis control is a dynamic process that coordinates not only bulk mRNA translation, but also the specialized translation of distinct mRNAs important for cancer phenotypes. Recently, our laboratory has developed and characterized a new in vitro and in vivo toolkit of both human and murine androgen receptor-low CRPC. We have used these models to discover a critical link between androgen receptor signaling and the process of mRNA translation initiation, which is critical for androgen receptor-low CRPC growth. We hypothesize that androgen receptor-low CRPC is driven by the specific translation of distinct mRNA networks, thereby leading to persistent tumor growth, which may represent a therapeutic vulnerability. Our long-term objective is to utilize state-of-the-art mouse models, ribosome profiling, and patient derived xenografts to definitively investigate the fundamental link between the androgen receptor and protein synthesis control in a highly relevant and newly emerging disease course for prostate cancer patients. To do so, we will address the following aims: 1) determine the mechanism by which the androgen receptor communicates with the translation apparatus, 2) delineate how aberrant protein synthesis drives the translation of distinct oncogenic mRNAs, and 3) elucidate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting translation initiation in androgen receptor-low CRPC. Ultimately, these studies are poised to uncover a new paradigm for gene regulation in androgen receptor-low prostate cancer and provide the preclinical basis for targeting the protein synthesis apparatus in an increasingly common highly aggressive disease.

Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this complex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the prohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water, dense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this project has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several highly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and interactions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote the survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that significantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also the three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In the following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and myeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will pursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and mitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic allografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).

Clinical studies show that autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains an efficacious consolidation treatment for eligible patients and a subset of transplant recipients achieve long-term control of disease. Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced by ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates inflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the potential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. We have recently utilized novel preclinical models to provide definitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific T cell immunity and the re-establishment of a state of immune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these systems is a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive populations and the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. These inhibitory pathways are highly amenable to immunotherapeutic approaches after ASCT that invoke long term survival. This proposal will utilize sophisticated protein and transcriptional based approaches to examine the relationship of T cell function in the peri-transplant period to subsequent survival and disease control in well-annotated clinical cohorts. A major focus will be the optimization of innovative immunotherapy approaches after ASCT in preclinical systems for clinical translation.

Although cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity are the earliest and most dramatic immune related adverse events (irAEs) after CARTx, severe manifestations are transient and only affect a minority of patients. In contrast, on-target, off- tumor depletion of non-malignant B lineage cells affects the majority of patients and all long-term responders. CD19 expression declines as B cells differentiate into plasma cells, whereas BCMA is selectively expressed by plasma cells. Since plasma cells are responsible for maintaining long-lived antibodies and naïve/memory B cells are important for generating new immunity, CD19 versus BCMA-CARTx may differentially affect preexisting immunity and vaccine responses. Dr. Hill’s goal is to understand the long-term effects of CARTx on humoral immunity. This proposal incorporates the expertise of an outstanding group of researchers in infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, epidemiology, laboratory medicine, and statistics who are dedicated to ensuring the success of this innovative research proposal. They will leverage their expertise and high-volume immunotherapy programs to achieve the following aims. The first Aim involves a prospective observational cohort study of 130 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 50 pediatric CD19, 30 adult BCMA) with relapse-free survival ≥6 months. Dr. Hill will use a novel systematic viral epitope scanning method (VirScan) to longitudinally characterize the antivirome to 206 viral pathogens. These results will describe, and identify correlates of, antivirome diversity metrics at 6- and 12-months post-CARTx. VirScan will allow for a nuanced assessment of the differential impacts of CARTx on humoral immune competence. The second Aim will utilize samples from Aim 1 to determine the effect of CARTx on the durability of preexisting humoral immunity to vaccine-preventable infections and the proportion of patients lacking seroprotection after CARTx. These data will expand on Aim 1 to inform vaccination strategies. In the third Aim, Dr. Hill will perform a prospective observational study of 95 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 25 pediatric CD19, and 20 adult BCMA) to define the frequency and correlates of positive vaccine responses ≥6 months after CARTx. Patients will be vaccinated for S. pneumoniae, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, H. influenza b, and hepatitis A and B according to institutional guidelines. This proposal will address critical knowledge gaps by employing innovative methods to elucidate the scope of pathogen-specific deficits in humoral immunity, and whether vaccination can mitigate these irAEs, after CARTx. The findings will guide evidence-based strategies for infection prevention, such as vaccination or immunoglobulin replacement, to improve outcomes in this rapidly growing population of high-risk individuals.

The dendritic cell (DC) is a specialized immune sentinel that directs T cells to tolerance or immunity. DC comprise a rich network in skin consisting of several different populations, but are understudied, leaving a major gap in therapeutic intervention. We have identified distinct properties for DC in skin that relay information by migrating out to the draining lymph node (LN). We find during inflammation skin migratory DC may direct T cells to tolerance by unknown mechanisms, counter-regulating and controlling immunity. These cells are uniquely genetically programed in humans and in mouse to dampen immunity with a high expression of shared tolerance genes, including some genes such as PD-L1 that have been successfully targeted in the clinic for peripheral tissue cancers including melanoma skin cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer. We hypothesize homeostatic programming of skin DC leads to failed immune priming leading to impaired early detection of skin cancers. We find these pathways are of great importance as therapeutic targets to promote self-tolerance (such as during autoimmune disease) or to block tolerance (to improve immunity during cancer). Because these mechanisms are distinct they can be combined with current modalities for patients in immunotherapy of skin cancer, vaccine science, and inflammatory skin disease. In 2 discrete aims, this application will address programmatic conditioning of skin DCs and the unique cellular mechanisms by which they promote immune tolerance in both mice and humans, examining consequences during immune priming and early skin cancer growth.

project	7R01CA143971-08	R01CA143971	9759724	2018	Understanding the AGL metastasis suppressor for therapeutic gain	Grant	﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer kills 15,000 annually and because of few therapeutic advances there is a need for innovation. This project has discovered suppressors of bladder tumor growth and metastasis and shown that low expression of AGL, an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis, and RhoGDI2, an inhibitor of multiple GTPases, is associated with cancer recurrence and death. The Goal of this continuation project is to understand how reduced AGL levels result in aggressive bladder cancer and to translate this knowledge into novel therapies. We found bladder cancer cells with low AGL express elevated levels of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) synthase 2 (HAS2), and its extracellular product HA, and have activated RhoC and Rac1, known drivers of tumor progression. We demonstrated RhoC/Rac1 activity is suppressed by RhoGDI2, linking the actions of the two metastasis suppressors. Cells with low AGL also exhibit increased glycolysis, glucose import and autophagy. When either glucose import or autophagy are blocked, low AGL tumor cells show greater reduction of in vitro growth than cells with higher AGL levels, exposing a vulnerability of these aggressive cells. These data support an innovative Hypothesis: Tumor cells with low AGL generate growth and metastatic signals via production of HA, activation of its receptors CD44 and RHAMM, and downstream effectors such as RhoC and Rac1. For these signals to be actualized, sufficient energy needs to be provided via enhanced glucose import and autophagy. Three Specific Aims will test this hypothesis. 1) Evaluate impact of HA signaling on aggressiveness of bladder cancers with low AGL. We will determine if HA drives tumor progression via its receptors CD44 and RHAMM and effectors RhoC and Rac1 that are inhibited by RhoGDI2. Experiments will use RNAi and receptor inhibition in human xenografts. 2) Determine role of the AGL signaling network in bladder cancer development and progression. We will evaluate the independent predictive value of tumor suppressor genes and components of the AGL signaling network in a large panel of annotated human tumors, to define a predictive multigene biomarker signature and possible new therapeutic targets. We will use full and conditional (bladder urothelium) AGL knockout mice in a chemical carcinogenesis model that generates spontaneous visceral metastases to test whether lack of AGL makes urothelium more susceptible to carcinogenesis and resulting tumors more aggressive. 3) Target molecular vulnerabilities of bladder cancers with low AGL expression. Here we test whether blocking glucose import and/or autophagy reduces in vivo bladder tumor growth. We will use shRNA and pharmacologic agents already in preclinical/clinical testing. We will screen shRNA libraries to metabolic and autophagy genes in cells with low AGL to discover novel genes essential to the aggressive tumor phenotype, with the expectation that some of these will become therapeutic targets. We will evaluate combined inhibition of HA signaling and energy production pathways with the expectation this will have synergistic detrimental effects on tumor progression. Impact: This project will lay the foundation for future biomarker-driven personalized clinical trials that target critical vulnerabilities in bldder cancer while informing us on how AGL executes its unanticipated role in cancer.

However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes. This work will therefore help realize the promise of precision medicine in neuro- oncology.

project	7R01CA205426-06	R01CA205426	10470607	2021	Elucidating genetics of response to immune checkpoint blockade in lung cancer	Grant	Abstract  Immune checkpoint inhibitors like ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) and nivolumab (anti-PD1) are revolutionizing cancer treatment. Understanding the genetic basis of response and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors are critical for improving outcomes with current agents and for developing new ones. Patients can undergo dramatic remissions after treatment while others reap no benefit. Furthermore, the immune phenotype shows substantial temperospatial variability and is influenced by multiple variables. The rationale of this project is that there is a fundamental genetic basis underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors that is poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrates that response to immune checkpoint blockade is strongly determined by the tumor mutation landscape and dictated by a specific neoantigen repertoire. We will apply a conceptually and technically innovative, systematic, multidisciplinary, and highly collaborative approach to elucidate the neoantigen landscape underlying response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our contribution here is expected to provide unparalleled mechanistic detail on how immune checkpoint inhibitors function and to provide biomarkers to identify patients who will benefit from PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, building on data showing that resistance may be mediated by immune pressure and immunoediting, we will shed light into how resistance to these drugs develop, providing definitive evidence for causal mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity. Should our work succeed, we envision substantial utility for similar studies for other cancers. Such an understanding will provide great insight into the mechanisms underlying how immune checkpoint blockade works, provide much needed precise biomarkers, and establish a foundation to develop more effective immunotherapy.

Paradoxically, although estrogens stimulate breast cancers, risk rises markedly after menopause, when estrogens decrease. After menopause, estradiol falls and estrone is produced largely in fat by aromatase. Obesity women have high estrone, and both obesity and high estrone, but not estradiol, increase ER+ breast cancer risk after menopause. Low intra-tumor levels of enzymes converting estrone into estradiol, and elevation of enzymes that produce estrone both confer worse ER+ breast cancer outcome.  Obesity mediates chronic inflammation through NF-κB driven cytokine expression. We showed contact between invading breast cancer cells and obese adipose tissue induces pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cell types that stimulate cancer stem cells (CSC) and drive metastasis. Our data suggest that cytokine induction after breast fat:cancer cell contact is estrogen:ER dependent, since blocking estrogen synthesis with the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, reduced cytokine induction upon co-culture. While estradiol is known to oppose NF-κB mediated inflammation, the role of estrone in inflammation is not known and may differ from that of estradiol. We will study how estrone and estradiol, and changes in the ratios thereof before and after- menopause, may influence NF-κB activity and the pro-inflammatory state in obese postmenopausal women.  We hypothesize that increased estrone:estradiol ratio after menopause shifts ER from an NF-κB co- repressor to a co-activator to up-regulate cytokines in obese adipocytes and cancer cells that drive CSC expansion and metastasis. We also posit that enzymes that convert estradiol to estrone may contribute to the poor outcome of ER+ cancers in obesity. Aim 1 will test if estradiol:ER decreases, estrone:ER increases or different estradiol:estrone ratios alter ER effects on NF-κB mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene drivers of CSCs in ER+ breast cancer cells. To test in Aim 2 if estrone cooperates with obesity to drive ER+ breast cancer initiation and growth, we will co-culture human ER+ breast cancer cells with mammary adipocytes from women with different body mass index (BMI) +/- aromatase inhibition and test consequences on cytokine levels and CSC. We will also implant syngeneic breast cancers into lean or obese wild-type or aromatase knock-out mice to elucidate if host estrone mediates tumor promoting effects of obesity. Aim 3 will test if overexpression of HSD17B14, that converts estradiol to estrone, increases ER+ breast cancer cytokine expression and CSC in vitro, and increases tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo. We will also compare levels of estradiol/estrone interconversion enzymes in breast adipocytes and cancers from lean, overweight and obese women. A better understanding of the roles of estradiol and estrone may lead to new strategies for breast cancer prevention and treatment, and to changes in hormone replacement therapies. Shifting toward a higher estradiol: estrone ratio in serum or in breast cancer cells may prove to have therapeutic potential.

Despite the known benefits of AETs, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. Furthermore, lower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality outcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more effective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and mortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have targeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a statistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web- enabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms will be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider communication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot trial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly reminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control group (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding the intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to develop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term effects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample powered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1) an “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a “Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET adherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning symptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable alerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long- term adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures, including AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will provide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the “Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience.

project	7R33CA225248-02	R33CA225248	9752092	2017	Area A: In-Depth Proteome Mapping of the Tumor Microenvironment with Single-  Cell Resolution	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The development of effective therapies for cancer requires a deep molecular understanding of tumor heterogeneity by advanced omics technologies with spatially resolved measurements. Unfortunately, there are substantial gaps in existing capabilities in terms of sensitivity. For example, a minimum of many thousands of cells is required for in-depth profiling of proteins in a biological sample. We have recently developed a breakthrough technology, termed nanoPOTS (Nanodroplet Preparation in One pot for Trace Samples) which, when coupled to ultrasensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), enables effective analysis of as few as 10 mammalian cells with a coverage of >3000 identified proteins. We hypothesize that the nanoPOTS platform will be an enabling technology to characterize the molecular underpinnings of tumor heterogeneity by creating 3D proteome maps of human tumors. The overall objective of our study is to extend and validate this analysis platform to enable single-cell resolution measurements at high throughput (>100 samples per day) and apply the platform to create 3D proteome maps of human tumors. Studies in Aim 1 will focus on optimizing and validating the ultrasensitive nanoPOTS proteomic workflow to enable robust proteome profiling of ≥3,000 protein groups from single human cells obtained by both flow cytometry and laser capture microdissection (LCM). Aim 2 will evaluate and compare two complementary technologies for increasing measurement throughput to ~100 cells/day with minimal impact on proteome coverage. We will determine whether multiplexing through application of isobaric labels for pooled analysis, or rapid LC coupled with ultrahigh resolution ion mobility spectrometry-MS provides greatest coverage, quantitation and reproducibility for single cell proteomics at the desired throughput. In Aim 3, we will apply the optimized platform to create in-depth proteome maps for human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) at single cell resolution. Following initial targeted studies of specific cells of interest within sectioned tissues, we will use a combination of cryosectioning, LCM and the optimized nanoPOTS platform to analyze single cells within the tumor microenvironment. 3D reconstruction of these in-depth, spatially resolved proteomic analyses will provide the first global proteomic tumor maps at single-cell resolution. This project will not only establish an innovative measurement capability that will broadly advance cancer research, but will also provide unique molecular insights into cellular heterogeneity relevant to PDA pathology. The resulting platform will be disseminated through a combination of publication and commercialization.

Recent clinical and experimental studies addressing this problem require the arduous collection of pre- and post- treatment data for every new specific treatment and cancer type studied. Thus, a computational approach that can expedite the identification of molecular determinants of resistance via the analysis of existing large-scale cancer cohorts is called for.  Our proposal seeks to identify novel ways to counter de novo and acquired resistance through drug combinations. We focus on gene interactions rather than individual genes and leverage large scale genomic datasets and patient response data. Our approach is based on recent work in the Ruppin and other labs showing that genetic interactions can be computationally identified by analyzing omics tumor data.  To decipher pathways of resistance to cancer therapies, we focus here on studying a new type of genetic interactions, termed synthetic rescues (SRs). SRs denote a functional interaction between two genes whereby a fitness reducing change in the activity of one of the two genes (termed the vulnerable gene) is compensated by altered activity of another gene (termed the rescuer gene), which restores cell fitness and rescues it. We have recently developed tools for SR data-driven identification from large cancer tumors cohorts, successfully enabling the prediction of drug response and emergence of resistance in patients. Building on these transformational results the specific aims of this proposal are: Specific Aim 1. Perform a pan-cancer and cancer type-specific SR-based analyses, focusing on melanoma, breast, head and neck, and colon cancer, identifying the major rescuer genes in each cancer type, together with specific recommendations of combinatorial therapies mitigating resistance. Specific Aim 2. Develop a new version of SR analysis tools that will be made publically available for use by others in a standard, user friendly manner and includes analysis of gene methylation and genome wide mutation data, on top of other omics data already utilized in our previous SR inference tools. Specific Aim 3. Experimentally test predicted rescuer targets and combination therapies in patient derived resistant cancer cells.  Taken together the proposed study, will present a transformative SR based approach for identifying and targeting resistance pathways across the whole cancer genome.

Colonoscopy as primary screening has been accompanied by a modest but steady decline in CRC incidence through identification and removal of precursor lesions, the adenomatous polyp. Indeed, there has been a 32% decline between years 2000-2013 in CRC incidence in patients over age 50 (thus eligible for screening). Strikingly, during this same time period, the incidence rate for those under 50 has increased by 22%. Thus, new and effective screening strategies are urgently needed to address the rising burden of CRC (≤50 years) which is expected to increase over the next decade with the rising young population. The objective of the R33 Moonshot Project is to develop a highly advanced screening approach to identify the subset of young patients who actually harbor advanced adenomas and could benefit from colonoscopy via a test that is sensitive to advanced adenomas, low-cost, and that can be carried out in a primary care setting. To this end, we have developed a new technology, partial wave spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy or nanocytology. Nanocytology performed on colonocytes swabbed from the rectal mucosa is able to identify nanoscale alterations in higher order chromatin structure, which are highly accurate markers of the presence of advanced adenomas that might be located anywhere in the colon. The goal for the proposed project is to finalize the PWS technology, turn it into a practical, accurate, and low-cost test that is viable for young population screening, and conduct a pre-definitive clinical trial. We aim to achieve sensitivity and specificity over 90%. Upon the completion of this moonshot project, nanocytology will be ready for a definitive clinical trial, which can lead to CLIA approval and launch in clinical practice as a laboratory-developed test (LDT).

The project detailed here commences with the selection and careful characterization of a dozen fully human antibodies to Glypican-2, the most promising antigen in neuroblastoma, from a pre-existing hybridoma stock. These antibodies, along with their full sequences, binding affinities, cellular internalization, epitope, and (where possible) crystal structures, will be made available to Consortium members within the first year for use in their modality of choice. This project will explore their utility as components in double bispecific antibody therapy: this double bispecific approach targets two cancer antigens and two T cell receptors simultaneously, inducing T cell activation and co-activation only in the presence of cancer cells expressing both antigens. The double targeting strategy should allow for a much higher level of selective engagement and killing than has heretofore been possible with therapies that target only a single cancer antigen, and should it prove effective in neuroblastoma the approach is likely to have utility in a wide variety of cancers. One historical weakness for the development of immuno-oncology approaches such as this one is that the animal models have had very little predictive value. For this reason, the best of the humanized mouse models, “MISTRG” mice, will be used both for the development of these molecules and for testing the other consortium members’ approaches, where they could be useful. CIVO multi- needle array technology will be employed to simplify the combinatorial challenge associated with testing pairs of bispecific molecules; this technology will also be open for use collaboratively with the other Consortium members. In short, the proposal provides the Consortium with human antibodies against a validated neuroblastoma target, access to the current state-of-the-art in humanized mice, a CIVO multi-needle array device to facilitate testing therapeutics, and a double bispecific antibody therapeutic approach that promises a high level of T cell killing and selectivity and a likely broad applicability beyond neuroblastoma.

Bridging of this gap could lead to novel immunotherapies. Our long-term goals are to develop novel immunotherapies for leukemia and pediatric solid tumors. Our objective in this application is to investigate the role of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing Stimulation-2 (ST2), the IL-33 receptor in the microenvironment as well as ST2 on tumoral cells. Our central hypothesis is that we can target the tumoral microenvironment and tumoral cells by blocking the IL-33/ST2 pathway with neutralizing and bispecific antibodies that we will develop. This hypothesis was formed based on our unpublished preliminary data showing that: First, nonmalignant mice deficient in T-bet have elevated numbers of BM-infiltrating ST2+ Tregs compared to wild-type (WT) mice (45% vs 25%, respectively), suggesting reciprocal roles of ST2/IL33 and T- bet/interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in Tregs from the BM niche. Second, we observed 10-fold more Tregs expressing significantly more activation markers in the BM niche of AML-bearing mice than in the nonmalignant niche. Third, MLL-AF9 AML cell proliferation was significantly lower in mice receiving donor syngeneic ST2 knock-out (ST2-/-) T cells than in mice receiving donor syngeneic WT T cells (2% vs 17%, respectively). ST2 blockade also decreased Treg activation (i.e., KLRG1) and increased type 1 signaling in CD8+ T cells as well as decreased their exhaustion, suggesting restoration of an antitumoral response in ST2-/- mice. The rationale for this study is that once we are able to understand the biology of the immunological microenvironment in the malignant niche, we can propose personalized treatment plans to block the tolerogenic pathways. Similarly, understanding the biology responsible for the overexpression of ST2/IL-33 on the tumoral cell, will help target this pathway. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Explore ST2 and IL-33 expression on tumoral cells and in the tumoral microenvironment from liquid and solid childhood cancers in human and mice; 2) Examine whether ST2/IL-33 blockade can impact tumor immunity in the malignant BM niche and solid tumor microenvironment as a proof-of-principle of a novel antitumoral immunotherapy; and 3) Optimizing anti-ST2 neutralizing antibodies against murine and human targets for translational purpose. This approach is innovative because, to our knowledge, the function of ST2+ Tregs in the malignant microenvironment, remains virtually unexplored. It will also provide biological insights into the nature of ST2+ Tregs and ST2+ tumoral cells in the microenvironment and determine whether their blockade can restore antitumoral activity and decrease tumoral proliferation via a dual mechanism. The proposed research is significant because novel antitumoral immunotherapies that are more targeted and less toxic than classical chemotherapy/irradiation regimens are needed.

project	7U01CA233085-02	U01CA233085	10406767	2019	U01 Proposal Transfer - 2021	Grant	The goal of our studies is to generate robust and long-lasting tumor-specific T cell responses for durable tumor regression in patients with chemotherapy-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Although immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive T cell therapy, or oncolytic viruses has generated remarkable results in several other tumor types, long-term tumor control has been infrequent in EOC patients. Studies by our group have identified key stumbling blocks underpinning the limited efficacy of immunotherapy in EOC, which include: (i) tumor-derived CXCL12 production that recruits intra-tumoral T regulatory cells and suppressive myeloid cells, (ii) expression of multiple co-inhibitory receptors on tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL), (iii) compensatory upregulation of immune checkpoints upon blockade of one pathway, (iv) low intrinsic tumor immunogenicity partially dependent on reduced IFNβ production, (v) inability of TIL to resist immune suppression mediated by inhibitory cytokines such as TGFβ, and (vi) adaptive upregulation of immune inhibitory checkpoints. While combinatorial immunotherapy strategies have the potential to overcome these intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance mechanisms, they are often associated with unacceptably high rates of toxicities in patients. Our proposal addresses these stumbling blocks using innovative, clinically translatable, state-of-the-art strategies to concomitantly reprogram the tumor microenvironment (TME) and T cells, while minimizing the potential for high rates of systemic toxicities.  We have previously demonstrated that an oncolytic vaccinia virus armed with a CXCR4 antagonist (OV-CXCR4-Fc) results in direct tumor oncolysis but is incapable of preventing tumor recurrence due to upregulation of multiple immune checkpoint receptors and insufficient persistence of T cells in the TME due to increasing levels of immunosuppressive TGFb. To overcome these limitations, we propose to test the efficacy of a multifaceted oncolytic virus incorporating the CXCR4 antagonist and multiple checkpoint inhibitors, followed by adoptive transfer of tumor antigen-specific T cells engineered to resist TGFβ. We hypothesize that in vivo tumor destruction by the multipotent oncolytic virus will limit dampening of the immune response in the TME and thus further promote the infiltration and sustained anti-tumor function of the transferred T cells engineered to resist TGFβ. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: Aim 1. To select the optimal combination of oncolytic vaccinia virus-delivered immune checkpoint inhibitors  that would effectively augment the efficacy of OV-CXCR4-Fc. Aim 2. Determine the therapeutic synergy of OV-CXCR4-Fc-MICB with adoptively transferred T cells that are  rendered insensitive to TGFβ. Aim 3. To manufacture and certify a Master Viral Bank (MVB) and Final Product (FP) of recombinant oncolytic  vaccinia virus selected in Aims 1 and 2 for IND qualification.

To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections, almost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and communities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and affordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and more likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies among AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating that the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing PA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0- 20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the efficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal level) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a private Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community level) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA tracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other activities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be recruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site RCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group, to achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 - To improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life. Analyses of hypothesized mediation factors for Aims 1-3 and post-trial qualitative interviews among participants with and without private health insurance will provide explanatory knowledge to help refine intervention procedures and tailor the intervention for future RCTs among patient subgroups who will most benefit. If shown to be efficacious, this mHealth intervention to improve PA in AYA survivors is highly scalable because smartphones and social media are widespread, PA trackers are popular and affordable, goal setting can be automated, and social media activities do not require specialized staff.

project	7U01DE028233-04	U01DE028233	10291087	2020	Targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and immuno-radiotherapy for oral cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT: Radiation therapy (RT) is a mainstay of cancer treatment. However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it possible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence at a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor cells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune- stimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine RT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the types of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating effects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral cancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate. Studies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an immunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti- tumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor microenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1) determine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer to RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the immunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug formulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will accomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims: In Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance in mouse oral cancer models. In Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment with RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses. In Aim 3 we will develop a novel drug delivery system that can enhance delivery of inhibitors of MDSC function directly to the tumor and tumor-infiltrating MDSC.

project	7U24CA180996-09	U24CA180996	10449603	2021	Cancer Genomics: Integrative and Scalable Solutions in R/Bioconductor	Grant	Abstract Bioconductor is an ecosystem of more than 1,500 open-source software and data packages for the statistical analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is widely used by the cancer genomics research community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core data classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and efficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell assays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of DNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a single specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the data. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to meet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of single-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant prioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of experimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create provenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in prioritization. Third, we develop scalable infrastructure for the curation, distribution, maintenance, discoverability, and usability of cancer data resources within and externally to Bioconductor. Finally, we develop a program of user training and new outreach approaches to support adoption of advanced Bioconductor infrastructure by developers of new cancer-related packages and existing packages critical to the cancer research community.

To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer		BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE	DUARTE	CA	UNITED STATES	ANDREA Hope BILD	DCB	Shannon K Hughes	1531573	>=$1M	1531573	16-Mar-2018	15-May-2017	30-Jun-2022	RFA-CA-15-014	Moonshot
