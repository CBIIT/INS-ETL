project	1R01CA210259-01A1	9333520	2017	Using Technology to Scale-Up an Occupational Sun Protection Policy Program	Grant	A key goal in the Affordable Care Act is building a national culture of prevention through workplace health and\nsafety initiatives. To achieve this goal, methods for scaling up evidence-based programs from research to wide-\nscale dissemination are needed to help balance effectiveness and cost. In many cases, there are pressures to\nreduce scale-up costs but at the expense of lower program implementation and effectiveness. A scale-up\nmethod that sacrifices effectiveness but reduces costs and reaches a larger number of employers may be\nacceptable. We will model the effectiveness and cost trade-off, along with the extent and representativeness of\nreach, when scaling up our evidence-based occupational sun protection intervention, Sun Safe Workplaces\n(SSW), for national distribution. The intervention, which relies on personal contact with managers and in-\nperson employee training (SSW-IP), created large improvements in comprehensive workplace sun safety (i.e.,\npolicy adoption and employee education) in a randomized controlled trial. We will compare the existing in-\nperson program delivery methods (SSW-IP) to a lower-cost dissemination method that utilizes Internet\ntechnology (SSW-T), i.e., virtual meetings, social networking, online training, and program materials. The aims\nof the research are to: 1) estimate the program reach (number and representativeness) and implementation\nrates (i.e., adoption of policies and delivery of education on occupational sun protection) achieved by the SSW-\nIP and SSW-T in a model of national distribution to public safety and public works industries; 2) estimate the\ncosts associated with the SSW-IP and SSW-T (i.e., intervention costs and induced employer costs) and compare\nthe estimated program benefits (i.e., policy and education) to cost; and 3) estimate the effect and cost-\neffectiveness of SSW-IP and SSW-T in secondary outcomes of a) changes in workplace environments and\nprocedures for sun safety and b) workers’ sun safety practices. In a 5-year project, SSW-T will be created by\nredesigning our very effective SSW-IP methods to use the latest web conferencing, social networking, and\nonline training technology for dissemination. The implementation rates (defined as policy adoption and\neducation delivery) and costs associated with SSW-IP (n=50 employers) and SSW-T (n=150 employers) will be\nmodeled in a randomized two-group pretest-posttest design, enrolling a national sample of 200 employers (i.e.,\nfirefighting departments and state departments of transportation). Unlike traditional randomized trials, the\nprimary analysis will be of cost effectiveness to test the hypothesis that SSW-T can be delivered cost-effectively\nto an expanded group of worksites producing a lower implementation rate than SSW-IP but at substantially\nlower cost. Secondary analyses will compare the two scale-up strategies on implementation rate, differences in\nrate by employer groups (e.g., size and region), changes to workplace environment/procedures, and employee\nsun safety practices. The findings will have high impact by helping public health practitioners select the best\nstrategy for scaling up evidence-based workplace health and safety programs to achieve this ACA goal.

project	1R01CA211723-01A1	9384218	2017	Implementing Universal Lynch Syndrome Screening across Multiple Healthcare Systems: Identifying Strategies to Facilitate and Maintain Programs in Different Organizational Contexts	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nLynch syndrome (LS) is the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer risk. People with\nLynch syndrome are also at increased risk for endometrial, ovarian, gastric, small bowel, and\nrenal cancers. Importantly, well-established clinical guidelines with strong evidence exist for\ncancer treatment, screening, and prevention in individuals with LS. Identification of individuals\nwith LS is accomplished through a variety of techniques, including family and medical history\nevaluation, computational models, or tumor testing. The systematic screening of all colorectal\ntumors for LS was first recommended by the Evaluation of Genetic Application in Practice and\nPrevention (EGAPP) working group in 2009 and has been designated high priority by the\nNational Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine working group and by the Blue\nRibbon Panel. The potential public health impact to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality of this\nintervention supports this priority, as effective implementation of LS screening will help meet the\ngoals of the Cancer Moonshot as well as demonstrate the promise of precision medicine.\nCurrently, implementation of LS screening in healthcare systems remains suboptimal for a\nvariety of reasons. LS screening involves the coordination of multiple departments and\nindividuals across an organization, which is often difficult in large, complex, healthcare systems.\nTherefore, the overarching goal of this project is to utilize tools from implementation science to\ndescribe, explain, and compare decision making and other variations in LS screening\nimplementation across multiple healthcare systems to create and evaluate in a real world setting\nan organizational toolkit to facilitate implementation of LS screening. Our specific aims are to (1)\nDescribe variation in LS screening implementation across multiple healthcare systems; then (2)\nExplain practice variation and determine factors associated with optimal implementation; and (3)\nDetermine the relative effectiveness, efficiency, and costs of different LS screening protocols by\nhealthcare system; and finally to (4) Develop and test in a natural environment an organizational\ntoolkit for LS screening. This toolkit will enable effective implementation of LS screening\nprograms; ultimately preventing needless suffering of patients and their family members from\npreventable cancers, decreasing waste in healthcare system costs, and informing strategies to\nfacilitate the promise of precision medicine.

project	1R01CA218306-01	9365804	2017	Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of HPV+ women who have performed self-collection	Grant	7. Project summary/abstract\nPROJECT: Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of\nHPV+ women who have performed self-collection\nCervical cancer is a serious public health problem reflecting social and gender inequalities in health. It is the\nthird cause of cancer death among women in the world, with more than 85% of cases occurring in developing\ncountries. Currently, the development of new technologies based on HPV DNA detection allows HPV self-\ncollection, increasing screening coverage. In a self-collection based strategy, triage becomes a key step in the\nprevention process, as it is the first method to identify HPV+ women who will need diagnostic and treatment\nprocedures. However, high adherence to triage is difficult to obtain, which is not surprising given that\nadherence to follow-up and treatment is a generalized problem in cervical cancer programs.\nSpecific aims of the study are: 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative multi-component mHealth\nintervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests compared to usual\ncare. 2. To evaluate the implementation strategy and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the\nmulti-component mHealth intervention.\nThe research study design will follow the structure of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial, and\nwill use mix-method approach. A cluster randomized trial including 200 CHWs (clusters) and 4000 women will\nbe used to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to\ncytology triage at 120 days after positive HPV testing. The mHealth intervention will include SMS messages\nsent to HPV+ women to inform them when results are available, and subsequent SMS messages as\nreminders. In addition, for those HPV+ women who did not had a triage cytology result within 60 days of the\nHPV test result, CHWs will receive an e-mail and SMS message so they can contact these women during\nhome visits for specific counseling and support. For the implementation evaluation, the Consolidated\nFramework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to guide qualitative data collection and analysis\nof factors that influence implementation. RE-AIM will be used to assess the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,\nImplementation and Maintenance of the Intervention.\nResults of this project will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention\nto increase triage of HPV+ women, but it could be adapted to increase compliance of diagnoses/ treatment of\ncervical cancer and other health problems. Findings from the implementation evaluation will be highly\napplicable to programs that use or are planning to incorporate HPV self-collection in different settings and\ncountries. In addition, the use of CFIR and RE-AIM in this innovative study will serve as a model of work,\nconstituting an important advance in the use of Implementation Science in the Region.

project	1R33CA225248-01	9482608	2017	Area A: In-Depth Proteome Mapping of the Tumor Microenvironment with Single-Cell Resolution	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe development of effective therapies for cancer requires a deep molecular understanding of tumor\nheterogeneity by advanced omics technologies with spatially resolved measurements. Unfortunately, there are\nsubstantial gaps in existing capabilities in terms of sensitivity. For example, a minimum of many thousands of\ncells is required for in-depth profiling of proteins in a biological sample. We have recently developed a\nbreakthrough technology, termed nanoPOTS (Nanodroplet Preparation in One pot for Trace Samples) which,\nwhen coupled to ultrasensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), enables effective analysis of\nas few as 10 mammalian cells with a coverage of >3000 identified proteins. We hypothesize that the nanoPOTS\nplatform will be an enabling technology to characterize the molecular underpinnings of tumor heterogeneity by\ncreating 3D proteome maps of human tumors. The overall objective of our study is to extend and validate this\nanalysis platform to enable single-cell resolution measurements at high throughput (>100 samples per day) and\napply the platform to create 3D proteome maps of human tumors. Studies in Aim 1 will focus on optimizing and\nvalidating the ultrasensitive nanoPOTS proteomic workflow to enable robust proteome profiling of ≥3,000 protein\ngroups from single human cells obtained by both flow cytometry and laser capture microdissection (LCM). Aim\n2 will evaluate and compare two complementary technologies for increasing measurement throughput to ~100\ncells/day with minimal impact on proteome coverage. We will determine whether multiplexing through application\nof isobaric labels for pooled analysis, or rapid LC coupled with ultrahigh resolution ion mobility spectrometry-MS\nprovides greatest coverage, quantitation and reproducibility for single cell proteomics at the desired throughput.\nIn Aim 3, we will apply the optimized platform to create in-depth proteome maps for human pancreatic ductal\nadenocarcinomas (PDAs) at single cell resolution. Following initial targeted studies of specific cells of interest\nwithin sectioned tissues, we will use a combination of cryosectioning, LCM and the optimized nanoPOTS\nplatform to analyze single cells within the tumor microenvironment. 3D reconstruction of these in-depth, spatially\nresolved proteomic analyses will provide the first global proteomic tumor maps at single-cell resolution. This\nproject will not only establish an innovative measurement capability that will broadly advance cancer research,\nbut will also provide unique molecular insights into cellular heterogeneity relevant to PDA pathology. The\nresulting platform will be disseminated through a combination of publication and commercialization.

project	1R33CA225281-01	9482918	2017	Area C: Functional microscale organotypic assays to predict patient response to anti-angiogenesis therapies	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCancer is driven both by genetic mutations and microenvironmental factors (e.g. cell-cell\ninteractions). It is now clear that in order to develop effective therapies and predict patient\nresponse we need to better understand these interactions. Biomimetic tissue-engineered\ntechnologies and models hold the promise of incorporating more components into in vitro/ex\nvivo models and, thus, make them more accurately reflect human disease. Here we focus on\nkidney cancer and specifically, on the interactions between cancer cells and the vasculature (i.e.\nendothelial cells) - an interaction that is understudied, yet critical to better understanding,\napplying anti-angiogenic drugs and developing new such therapies. Our proposal describes an\nintegrated approach that increases relevance by enabling physiologically relevant models that\nreplicate structure/function relationships while providing patient specificity. Our approach is\ntransdisciplinary including expertise in oncology (Christos Kyriakopoulos), surgery (Jason Abel),\npathology (Wei Huang), clinical imaging (Steve Cho), biostatistics/clinical analysis (Kyungmann\nKim) and microtechnology/organotypic models (David Beebe). Specifically, we will develop a\nrobust microvessel culture approach (uVESSEL) to create an in vitro/ex vivo model of kidney\ncancer-vascular interactions using the patient's own cells to measure therapy response of\npatient specific uVESSEL model (Aim 1), measure patient response via multiple endpoints (incl.\nPSMA-based PET/CT imaging) (Aim 2), and evaluate predictive value of patient specific\nuVESSEL model (Aim 3). Our approach is bench to bedside and back again taking advantage\nof our teams' location with the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center and access to\npatient samples. Our goal is to push the boundaries between in vitro models and ex vivo\nexperiments by putting the patient's cells into biomimetic models.

project	1R33CA225291-01	9482962	2017	Area C: Genome-wide identification and targeting of resistance to cancer therapy	Grant	Summary: Area C: Genome-wide identification and targeting of resistance to cancer therapy\nThe frequent emergence of resistance to anti-cancer therapies remains a major challenge in cancer treatment\nthat is of utmost importance. Recent clinical and experimental studies addressing this problem require the\narduous collection of pre- and post- treatment data for every new specific treatment and cancer type studied.\nThus, a computational approach that can expedite the identification of molecular determinants of resistance\nvia the analysis of existing large-scale cancer cohorts is called for.\n Our proposal seeks to identify novel ways to counter de novo and acquired resistance through drug\ncombinations. We focus on gene interactions rather than individual genes and leverage large scale genomic\ndatasets and patient response data. Our approach is based on recent work in the Ruppin and other labs\nshowing that genetic interactions can be computationally identified by analyzing omics tumor data.\n To decipher pathways of resistance to cancer therapies, we focus here on studying a new type of genetic\ninteractions, termed synthetic rescues (SRs). SRs denote a functional interaction between two genes whereby a\nfitness reducing change in the activity of one of the two genes (termed the vulnerable gene) is compensated by\naltered activity of another gene (termed the rescuer gene), which restores cell fitness and rescues it. We have\nrecently developed tools for SR data-driven identification from large cancer tumors cohorts, successfully\nenabling the prediction of drug response and emergence of resistance in patients. Building on these\ntransformational results the specific aims of this proposal are:\nSpecific Aim 1. Perform a pan-cancer and cancer type-specific SR-based analyses, focusing on\nmelanoma, breast, head and neck, and colon cancer, identifying the major rescuer genes in each\ncancer type, together with specific recommendations of combinatorial therapies mitigating resistance.\nSpecific Aim 2. Develop a new version of SR analysis tools that will be made publically available\nfor use by others in a standard, user friendly manner and includes analysis of gene methylation and\ngenome wide mutation data, on top of other omics data already utilized in our previous SR inference tools.\nSpecific Aim 3. Experimentally test predicted rescuer targets and combination therapies in\npatient derived resistant cancer cells.\n Taken together the proposed study, will present a transformative SR based approach for identifying and\ntargeting resistance pathways across the whole cancer genome.

project	1R33CA225296-01	9482979	2017	Advanced Cancer Classification via Single-Cell Electrophoretic Cytopathology	Grant	ABSTRACT\nRecent efforts to identify and circumvent mechanisms of drug resistance point to the role of HER2 truncated\nisoforms, which lack the extracellular domain of the full-length protein targeted by trastuzumab. Understanding\nthe biology of HER2 isoforms is crucial to developing new drugs personalized for individuals resistant to\ntrastuzumab therapy. However, detection of these isoforms in paraffin-embedded tissue sections (FFPE) is\nimpossible by conventional methods (Immunohistochemistry, IHC) due to the lack of isoform-specific antibodies\nand the loss of epitope integrity during tissue processing. To overcome these barriers, the goal of this project\nis to develop a robust tool that will both allow retrospective studies on HER2 isoforms and enable\nisoform screening on a patient-to-patient basis to tailor breast cancer treatment.\nOur efforts fill a major gap in cancer research: the limited ability to scrutinize tissue sections for protein targets\nthat either lack highly specific antibody probes (analytical) or lose epitope integrity during tissue processing (pre-\nanalytical). We introduce a whole-tissue western blot (wtWestern) that creates a novel 3D protein ‘imprint’\nof the tissue section for stable storage and downstream antibody probing. The unique dual-functionality\nwtWestern electrophoretically resolves proteins (extracted from a 2D tissue section) along the depth (z-axis) of\na supporting photoactive hydrogel layer. Exposure to UV light covalently links protein to the hydrogel. We\nbenchmark the fixative-free imprint for biobanking suitability, apply the wtWestern to measurement of proteins\n(including isoforms) in archived frozen or FFPE tissue sections, and maximize tissue utility by enabling detection\nof 20+ proteins for cancer sub-type classification. This innovative wtWestern is expected to maximize the quality\nand utility of biospecimens for downstream analyses – critically important to retrospective studies that form the\nbasis for both cancer diagnostics/prognostics and personalized medicine.\n	Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;Antibodies;Antineoplastic Agents;Archives;Benchmarking;Binding;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;Biometry;Blood Vessels;Breast;Breast Cancer Treatment;Cancer Diagnostics;Cell Communication;Cells;Cellular Morphology;Classification;Classification Scheme;Clinical;Complex;Cytometry;Cytopathology;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnostic;Drug resistance;ERBB2 gene;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epitopes;Exposure to;Extracellular Domain;Extracellular Matrix;Fixatives;Formalin;Freezing;Goals;Heterogeneity;Histology;Human;Hydrogels;Image;Immune;Immunohistochemistry;Individual;Laboratories;Length;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Mesenchymal;Methods;Microfluidics;Molecular;Morphology;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncoproteins;Paraffin Embedding;Pathology;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical shape;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Precision therapeutics;Progression-Free Survivals;Protein Isoforms;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Proteins;Resistance;Resolution;Retrospective Studies;Role;Selection for Treatments;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Slice;Statistical Methods;Stromal Cells;Taxonomy;Technology;Temperature;Tissue Embedding;Tissue Sample;Tissues;Trastuzumab;Ultraviolet Rays;Variant;Western Blotting;Woman;anticancer research;base;biobank;cancer classification;cancer subtypes;cancer therapy;clinical Diagnosis;commercialization;design;extracellular;humanized monoclonal antibodies;imprint;improved;innovation;insight;link protein;malignant breast neoplasm;mortality;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;personalized medicine;prognostic;protein biomarkers;protein profiling;resistance mechanism;screening;targeted cancer therapy;therapy development;tissue processing;tool;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY	BERKELEY	CA	UNITED STATES	Amy Elizabeth Herr	DCTD	Tawnya C Mckee	1453938	1453938	2017-09-25T04:00:00Z	2017-09-30T04:00:00Z	2022-05-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-17-023	Moonshot
project	1R33CA225310-01	9483034	2017	Area B:  Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to Measure Tumor Glutamine and Glucose Metabolic Rates in a Single Imaging Session	Grant	Precision oncology places an increased demand on cancer diagnostics to characterize tumors at the time of\ndiagnosis. Tissue diagnostics for precision oncology increasingly rely on multi-valent assays to characterize\ncancer biology and identify therapeutic targets. The power of molecular imaging for cancer diagnosis has been\nwell demonstrated by [18F]fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT), widely used in\nclinical oncology. PET tracers targeted to facets of tumor biology now enable multi-valent molecular imaging to\nidentify therapeutic targets. Early studies show that combined tracer studies, commonly FDG plus a target-\nspecific tracer, are highly predictive of tumor response to targeted therapy. However, emissions from different\nPET tracers are indistinguishable to a PET scanner, requiring separate imaging sessions on separate days for\nmultiple 18F-based tracers (~ 2 hour half-life) in the same patient. This limits the clinical practicality of multi-tracer\nPET, and fails to exploit the full power of multi-tracer PET to quantify tumor in vivo biology and biologic\nheterogeneity for highly variable process such as cancer metabolism. We will overcome this limitation by taking\nadvantage of recent developments in volumetric PET scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis\nmethods from our laboratories to develop Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate multi-valent,\nquantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session to guide precision oncology\nand translational cancer biology research. As such, our proposed technology development project addresses a\nneed, described under Priority Area B for “new capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer\npatients”. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we now propose to integrate and enhance these\nmethodologies to develop and validate Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate quantitative biologic\nparametric images for two or more tracers in a single session. We will develop and test this approach for\nsimultaneous glucose and glutamine metabolism imaging, with the goal of guiding metabolism-targeted therapy\nsuch as inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The project will focus on the\ntechnology developments (largely computational) that enable multi-tracer imaging. Ongoing and separately\nfunded work on clinical studies will acquire data from two separate imaging PET sessions using current\ntechnology and will provide data for method development. We will first optimize tracer dose timing, image\nreconstruction, and image time binning for dual tracer MTV-PET (Aim 1), followed by implementation and\ntechnical validation of image analysis using a mixture analysis approach (Aim 2). This will set the stage for\ntechnical validation of MTV-PET (Aim 3) and an exploratory aim (Aim 4) testing image analytics based on\nmachine learning. Successful completion of our technology development will yield a new method for multi-tracer\nPET that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarker and precision oncology research,\nconsistent with goals of RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B.	4D Imaging;Address;Agreement;Algorithms;Area;Biological Assay;Biology;Breast Cancer Patient;Cancer Biology;Cancer Diagnostics;Cancer Patient;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Cluster Analysis;Consumption;Data;Data Set;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Dose;Emerging Technologies;Funding;Glucose;Glutaminase;Glutamine;Glycolysis;Goals;Half-Life;Heterogeneity;Hour;Human;Image;Image Analysis;Injection of therapeutic agent;Kinetics;Laboratories;Lactate Dehydrogenase;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic;Metabolism;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Outcome;Patients;Phenotype;Positron-Emission Tomography;Process;Radiation exposure;Reference Standards;Research;Technology;Testing;Three-Dimensional Image;Time;Tissues;Tracer;Tumor Biology;Validation;Work;analytical method;anticancer research;base;cancer diagnosis;cancer imaging;clinical Diagnosis;cohort;diagnostic biomarker;genomic biomarker;glucose metabolism;high dimensionality;image reconstruction;imaging biomarker;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant breast neoplasm;metabolic rate;method development;molecular imaging;novel;parametric imaging;personalized diagnostics;phenotypic biomarker;precision oncology;radiotracer;reconstruction;response;targeted treatment;technology development;therapeutic target;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor metabolism;whole body imaging	UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	JOEL S KARP,DAVID A.

project	1R33CA225323-01	9483053	2017	Area B: Minimally Intrusive Colorectal Cancer Risk Stratification with Nanocytology: Targeting Underscreened Populations	Grant	Project Summary\nColorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among Americans underscoring\nthe need for more effective screening practices. Colonoscopy as primary screening has been accompanied by\na modest but steady decline in CRC incidence through identification and removal of precursor lesions, the\nadenomatous polyp. Indeed, there has been a 32% decline between years 2000-2013 in CRC incidence in\npatients over age 50 (thus eligible for screening). Strikingly, during this same time period, the incidence rate for\nthose under 50 has increased by 22%. Thus, new and effective screening strategies are urgently needed to\naddress the rising burden of CRC (≤50 years) which is expected to increase over the next decade with the rising\nyoung population. The objective of the R33 Moonshot Project is to develop a highly advanced screening\napproach to identify the subset of young patients who actually harbor advanced adenomas and could benefit\nfrom colonoscopy via a test that is sensitive to advanced adenomas, low-cost, and that can be carried out in a\nprimary care setting. To this end, we have developed a new technology, partial wave spectroscopic (PWS)\nmicroscopy or nanocytology. Nanocytology performed on colonocytes swabbed from the rectal mucosa is able\nto identify nanoscale alterations in higher order chromatin structure, which are highly accurate markers of the\npresence of advanced adenomas that might be located anywhere in the colon. The goal for the proposed\nproject is to finalize the PWS technology, turn it into a practical, accurate, and low-cost test that is viable\nfor young population screening, and conduct a pre-definitive clinical trial. We aim to achieve sensitivity\nand specificity over 90%. Upon the completion of this moonshot project, nanocytology will be ready for a\ndefinitive clinical trial, which can lead to CLIA approval and launch in clinical practice as a laboratory-developed\ntest (LDT).

project	1R33CA225328-01	9483059	2017	Area A: Development of genetically tractable, driver gene-syngeneic brain tumor models for pre-clinical adoptive TCR-T therapy	Grant	Summary of Work\nMalignant gliomas confer a dismal prognosis and have an inherent tendency to recur despite the most\naggressive of therapies. Recently, significant progress has been made in both understanding the genetic\nfoundation of these tumors as well as how to harness the power of the immune system to target these most\ndevastating tumors. While there has been substantial evidence in support of using T cells to treat established\ntumors in mice and humans, the translational value of these treatments has been limited by the simplicity of\nglioma models used for their development: mostly relying on transplanted tumors that do not recapitulate the\nimmune microenvironment present in human gliomas. To this end, this proposal seeks to develop a\nspontaneous and genetically faithful mouse glioma model by combining the initial IDH1R132H driver mutation\nwith other most common mutations. These models will maintain the integrity of the immune microenvironment\nof the brain and best recapitulating human glioma. With these models, we will also assess the interplay\nbetween glioma development and the immune response as dictated by different genetic mutations.\n Our second aim is to identify IDH1R132H reactive T cell antigen receptors (TCRs). We aim to improve the\ncurrent technology which employs single cell RNAseq to clone both the TCRα and TCRβ chains. We will\noptimize the current cloning procedures to dramatically reduce the reagent expense and labor cost, which is\nessential for its clinical application. This aim will be extended into a translational direction, aim 3, through\ngenetic engineering of T cells to redirect their antigen specificity against IDH1R132H. This aim is essentially a\nproof-of-principle study for TCR-T adoptive transfer immunotherapy in our immune-competent mouse glioma\nmodels.\n Combined, novel animal models and technologies developed in this study will help elucidate the complexities\nunderlying glioma genetics and how these commonly mutated genes contribute to glioma development,\nprogression, and glioma-specific immune suppression mechanisms. In addition, this will also facilitate the\ndevelopment and implementation a novel strategy for glioma immunotherapy.

project	1R33CA225400-01	9483217	2017	Area B: Precise DCE-MRI Assessment of Brain Tumors	Grant	AREA B: PRECISE DCE-MRI OF BRAIN TUMORS\nPROJECT SUMMARY\nThis project will develop and validate an improved dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI technique for\nassessing brain tumor response to therapy. Rationale: Historically, increases in tumor size or enhancement\nhave signified tumor progression, and decreases in tumor size have signified treatment response. With the\nadvent of novel chemotherapy agents, including immunotherapy, simple changes in size or enhancement are\nno longer sufficient to make treatment decisions. We believe that improved DCE-MRI methods can provide\nnew and powerful biomarkers to image brain tumors and detect early response to therapy. This will enhance\nour ability to prolong survival in a higher proportion of brain tumor patients traditionally regarded as the most\ndire prognostic group (including recurrent high-grade glioma and metastatic melanoma), who are often left out\nof clinical trials due to very short life expectancy. Innovation: We propose Specially Tailored Acquisition and\nReconstruction (STAR) DCE-MRI, in which acquisition and reconstruction are tailored from an estimation-\ntheoretic point of view to create the most accurate and reproducible tracer kinetic (TK) parameter maps, unlike\nconventional approaches that optimize the quality of intermediate images. We will fully integrate TK models\nwith DCE-MRI acquisition and reconstruction. Our preliminary data shows 36-fold improvement in spatial\nresolution and coverage compared to current techniques, with no loss of image quality in brain tumor patients;\nand we expect to only get better. Compared to current state-of-the-art DCE-MRI, this technique will provide\nthree major advances: 1- exquisite (sub-1 mm isotropic) spatial resolution to quantitatively assess narrow\ntumor margins and small lesions, 2- whole-brain coverage including all lesions and all surrounding tissue\nthereby simplifying the exam, 3- robust measurement of patient specific arterial inputs which are required for\naccurate contrast agent kinetic modeling. Approach: We will optimize, technically validate, and clinically\nevaluate STAR DCE-MRI method that provides improved quantitative parametric brain maps including blood-\nbrain barrier leakage and fractional plasma volume. Specifically, we will: 1- optimize and technically validate\nSTAR DCE-MRI to produce accurate and reproducible TK parameter maps, 2- produce a robust clinical\nimplementation of STAR DCE-MRI, and 3- clinically evaluate STAR DCE-MRI in patients with brain tumors,\nspecifically those with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with an anti-angiogenic agent, and those with brain\nmelanoma metastases treated with an immunotherapy agent. Broader Impact: Improved quantitative multi-\nparametric DCE-MRI has a potential role in the assessment of all neurologic diseases that have a\nmicrovascular component. This technical work, particularly leveraging specific nonlinear temporal models\nduring image reconstruction, is likely to have implications for DCE-MRI of prostate, renal, breast, and liver\ntumors as well as outside of DCE-MRI. Importantly it addresses a critical unmet need in oncology in providing\na robust, reproducible, high spatio-temporal resolution and high spatial coverage biomarker as a potential end\npoint for clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents in cancer research.

project	1U01CA224145-01	9449550	2017	Interrupting Cellular Crosstalk in the Immunosuppressive Microenvironment of Pancreas Cancer	Grant	Abstract\nImmune therapy has shown great promise in the treatment of a number of malignancies, but\nhas not proven fruitful in fighting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) using current\nmodalities. One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in\nestablishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication\nbetween cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and\ntumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize\nmacrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific\nmetabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making\nArginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer\ncells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of\nmatched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of\ncancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie “microtumors”) and a unique dual recombinase\ngenetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with\ninhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition,\novercoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer\nmicroenvironment.

project	1U01CA224146-01	9449587	2017	Systematic interrogation of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment in patient-derived specimens	Grant	Abstract\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 8%. Despite\nsuccess in other cancer types, immunotherapy approaches in PDAC have not shown efficacy. PDAC\ndemonstrates a heterogeneous and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is poorly\nunderstood and serves as a barrier to effective immunotherapy strategies in this disease. We propose that an\nimproved understanding of the TME and novel approaches that target key tumor-stroma interactions will\nenable remodeling of the immunosuppressive TME to enhance the efficacy of current and future\nimmunotherapy strategies. In particular, we believe that successful combination immunotherapy approaches in\nPDAC will include strategies that alter myeloid cells to relieve immunosuppression, cytotoxic therapies that\ntarget tumor cells to improve immune response, and agents that augment anti-tumor T cell activity. In this\nproject, we will perform a comprehensive characterization of the PDAC TME in both primary and metastatic\nPDAC in the baseline untreated context as well as across multiple different clinical therapies. In Aim 1, we will\nutilize single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic technologies to provide a cellular atlas of the PDAC TME at\nunprecedented resolution. In Aim 2, we will examine how the PDAC TME changes with chemotherapy,\nradiation therapy and a novel CCR2 inhibitor that modulates macrophage recruitment in the TME. For these\nstudies, we will utilize human samples derived from both resectable and metastatic patients on clinical trials at\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute. We will employ a novel ex vivo co-culture approach to enable rapid functional\nevaluation of tumor-stroma interactions and how they may impact immunotherapy responses. Lastly, in Aim 3\nwe will employ faithful immune competent PDAC mouse models and a novel cytokine delivery platform to\ninvestigate how targeted cytokine delivery to the TME may alter myeloid cell recruitment and function and\nimprove immune responses. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary collaborative team including experts in\nPDAC biology and genetics, immunologists and translational oncologists to comprehensively study PDAC TME\nand identify novel opportunities to develop combination immunotherapy approaches in this devastating\ndisease.

project	1U01CA224151-01	9449680	2017	Canine Immuno Neurotherapeutics	Grant	ABSTRACT:\nThe dog is an ideal large animal model for diagnostic and therapeutic studies and can be used to translate\nsuccesses to human patients while providing compassionate care to animals and advancing the field of\nveterinary medicine. Pet dogs share their environment, and oftentimes their diet, with their owners. Dogs and\nhumans develop sporadic benign and malignant brain tumors at about the same rate and with similar\nhistopathology. Dogs are often euthanized due to the cost of care. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine\nbrain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people as well as pets through comparative\noncology and genomics and the “One Medicine” approach to research and direct clinical application. We propose\na multi-institutional consortium to test an innovative combinatorial immunotherapeutic approach in dogs that\nspontaneously and sporadically develop malignant glial brain tumors that resemble in most important aspects,\nhigh-grade malignant gliomas in humans. Our approach will inject a clinical grade oncolytic herpes simplex virus\n(HSV) M032 that expresses human interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the resected tumor bed. Dog lymphocytes fully\nrespond to human IL-12 [1] and oncolytic HSV infect and kill canine (as well as mouse, non-human primate,\nhuman) tumor cells, creating a potent local inflammatory response and an antigen-rich tumor cell debris field.\nTherefore, we would anticipate that this virally-based immunotherapeutic approach would likely be as effective\nin dogs with brain tumors as in humans with brain tumors. We will conduct longitudinal safety, survival and\ncorrelative biology evaluations as a means of assessing the dog as an appropriate and informative model for\ndesign and implementation of clinical studies in humans with high-grade malignant brain tumors. To extend these\nfindings, we propose, in subsequent studies, to combine the HSV immunotherapy approach with molecules that\nblock the action of innate checkpoint inhibitor(s). These studies are designed to address key issues of safety\nand efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy in the dog that can be translated to humans with malignant gliomas.\nMalignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in humans, accounting for 30% of all primary\ncentral nervous system (CNS) tumors in adults. [2] With few major advances in decades, there has been no\nsignificant reduction in mortality and only a modest improvement in median survival. Recently, objective\nresponses and long-term survivals have been observed in human glioma patients who have received oncolytic\nvirotherapy and a Phase I trial is currently underway at UAB in patients using M032 alone. New approaches to\nutilize checkpoint inhibitors promises improved efficacy, but the ability to develop more effective combinatorial\napproaches has been slow, in large part due to lack of a faithful model of spontaneous glioblastoma multiforme\n(GBM) in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal\nopportunity to improve the lives of people and pets through comparative oncology and genomics using the “One\nMedicine“ approach to research and direct clinical application.

project	1U01CA224153-01	9449723	2017	Enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy in DLBCL using rational combination approaches	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nWhile small molecule inhibitors have made an impact in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL),\nimmunotherapy, specifically using anti-CD20 based approaches, has had the most profound effect on treatment\nstrategies and long-term outcomes. Despite this progress, up to 40% of patients will ultimately succumb to their\ndisease. Furthermore, even when treatment is successful, cytotoxic chemotherapy carries a high risk of long-\nterm morbidities that impact quality of life. The recent success of targeted therapies and immune checkpoint\ninhibitors in the setting of lymphoma demonstrates the potential for additional progress in long-term disease\ncontrol of DLBCL, with less toxicity. The molecular and genetic phenotype of canine DLBCL has been studied\nand it often resembles the activated B cell (ABC) category typically associated with aggressive DLBCL in people.\nMoreover, there is now substantial data that specific genetic changes and pathway aberrations are conserved\nacross dogs and people with DLBCL supporting the notion that the canine disease can be used as a relevant\nspontaneous large animal model of the human counterpart. Toward this end, the purpose of this proposal is to\nuse dogs with spontaneous naïve DLBCL to rapidly evaluate rational small molecule/immunotherapy\ncombination approaches, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most effective combination to move forward in\nhuman patients with DLBCL. Specifically, we hypothesize that optimal combinations of anti-CD20, anti-\nPD1, XPO1 inhibition, NAMPT/PAK4 and PI3Kdelta inhibition will have better outcomes than doxorubicin\nbased chemotherapy, resulting in a “chemo-free” blueprint for future human trials. Using an adaptive\nmini-pilot trial approach, those combinations deemed antagonistic and/or associated with unacceptable adverse\nevents can be rapidly removed from consideration, while those with clear therapeutic promise can be most\neffectively studied in the front-line setting and enhanced. We will accomplish this by first determining the optimal\nchemo-free regimen with small molecule/ anti-CD20 combinations, then identifying the optimal chemo-free\nregimen with small molecule/anti-PD1 combinations and finally, by evaluating a frontline chemo-free novel\ncombination regimen in canine DLBCL to demonstrate superiority to standard R-CHOP-based chemotherapy.\nAdditionally, we will interrogate correlative biomarkers based on RNA sequencing of tumor samples obtained\nfrom dogs enrolled into the prospective trials and develop signatures that can be used to predict not only\nresponse to therapy, but more importantly long-term progression-free survival. Together, the data generated\nfrom this proposal will create a framework for effectively leveraging information gained from integrated\nimmunotherapeutic trials in canine patients with DLBCL to develop chemo-free strategies that ultimately improve\nhuman outcomes.

project	1U01CA224160-01	9449905	2017	Novel combined immunotherapeutic strategies for glioma: using pet dogs as a large animal spontaneous model	Grant	There is a growing body of evidence that spontaneous cancers in dogs represent attractive translational\nmodels. In the field of immunotherapy, dogs offer an innovative model for translational research, as they\npresent many of the challenges faced in “scaling up” therapeutic systems dependent on complex interactions\nbetween multiple cell types yet under more controlled settings. They also allow for long-term assessment of\nefficacy and toxicities. Canine clinical trials offer unique access to a rich source of spontaneously occurring,\ngenetically and immunologically diverse cancers with the benefits of reduced time, expense, and regulatory\nhurdles of a human trial. The similarities between canine and human cancers are increasingly being realized.\nThe publicly available canine genome has propelled comparative genomics studies that have shown significant\nhomology between dogs and humans for recognized cancer-associated genes including MET, IGF1R, mTOR,\nand KIT. Not surprisingly, cytogenetic abnormalities that define human cancers, i.e. BCR-Abl translocations in\nchronic myelogenous leukemia and RB1 deletions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been found in\ncomparable canine cancers. Intracranial neoplasia occurs frequently in dogs with a reported prevalence from\n0.15 to 4.5% compared to 18.2 cases per 100,000 human. Astrocytoma or glioma account for 20-36% of\nprimary brain tumors in dogs and 25% in humans. Brachycephalic breeds such as Boxers, French and English\nbulldogs, and Boston terriers have a significantly increased risk of developing gliomas. Primary canine brain\ntumors have similar histologic classification as those reported by the World Health Organization for human\nbrain tumors. Similar to that in humans, the prognosis for dogs with brain tumors in general is poor regardless\nof therapeutic intervention. However, much less is known about canine glioma treatment outcomes because\nonly a small number of studies with few dogs have been reported. There is little information about median\nsurvival time for dogs with glioma that received any type of treatment, but estimates of days to 2 or 3 months\nare often given to owners. The clinical similarities between dogs and humans suggest that dogs may represent\nan outstanding model for testing targeted therapies; both dogs and humans might benefit from these studies.\nHerein, we are proposing a multi-pronged immunotherapeutic approach to improve efficacy and survival times.\nWe hypothesize that combination immunotherapy in a canine glioma model will enhance efficacy and\naccelerate successful translation into phase I human trials for GBM. The objective is to use pet dogs with\nspontaneous GBM to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of combination immunotherapy. We propose two\nSpecific Aims: 1. Determine the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in spontaneous\ncanine GBM in combination with standard of care, and 2. Assess the efficacy of immune-mediated gene\ntherapy in combination with CD200 blockade to enhance anti-glioma immunotherapy.\n!

project	1U01CA224166-01	9449992	2017	Enhancing natural killer immunotherapy with first-in-dog trials of inhaled recombinant IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15 in naturally occurring canine cancers	Grant	Project Summary\nThis proposal seeks to build on our extensive preliminary data in canine immunotherapy trials to demonstrate\nthat novel methods of exogenous cytokine delivery in combination with autologous natural killer (NK) cells in\nfirst-in-dog clinical trials represents a potentially high impact approach to optimize non-T cell based\nimmunotherapies. This work is targeted to dogs with typically lethal, naturally occurring osteosarcoma (OSA)\nand melanoma, and the findings are expected to have important relevance for the design and translation of\ninnovative immunotherapy approaches in humans. Inhaled (IH) IL-15 offers the advantages of local delivery of\nthis immune-stimulatory cytokine, while limiting systemic exposure and thus potential toxicity. Super-agonist IL-\n15 offers increased half-life and greater anti-tumor effects. Therefore, each of these cytokines is anticipated to\nalter the risk/benefit ratio in favor of their use. To accomplish these objectives, we propose the following three\nspecific aims: 1) Targeting gross pulmonary metastases (OSA and melanoma) with first-in-dog delivery of\ninhaled (IH) human IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15; 2) Phase II trial of IH IL-15 and autologous NK cells to treat\ngross OSA and melanoma pulmonary metastases, and; 3) Targeting micro-metastatic disease using super-\nagonist IL-15 in primary OSA. The canine model represents a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy research\nas an important link between murine models and human clinical studies. Dogs represent an attractive outbred\ncombination of companion animals that experience spontaneous cancer development in the setting of an intact\nimmune system. Importantly, these studies are designed to evaluate novel treatment combinations for\nadvanced pulmonary metastases in the setting of gross disease, but also will determine the impact of this\napproach as first-line therapy when combined with standard-of-care treatments. Moreover, this work seeks to\nelucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate an anti-tumor response (or non-response) in\ndogs with naturally occurring cancers. We will have the unique opportunity to perform whole exome\nsequencing and RNASeq on tumor tissue pre- and post-immunotherapy, and we will investigate whether a\nsignature of mutational landscape and gene expression profiles can be developed to prospectively predict\noutcome and response to immune therapies. We will correlate these data to immunohistochemical, flow\ncytometry, and serum cytokine readouts for evidence of transition from “cold” to “hot” tumors predictive of\nfavorable long term outcome. Hence, these canine trials and bio-marker studies represent an ideal strategy to\ninform and facilitate the rapid translation of novel, potentially high impact immune therapies to human patients\nwith aggressive cancers.

project	1U01CA224175-01	9450122	2017	Defining neoantigen immunodominance for antigen selection and biomarker discovery in human pancreatic cancer immunotherapy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nCheckpoint blockade immunotherapy has induced dramatic responses in treatment refractory cancers by\ntargeting neoantigens encoded by cancer-specific mutations. Neoantigen load predicts immunotherapeutic\nresponse, validating antigen identification as a rational strategy of biomarker discovery. Pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC) however has shown limited efficacy to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy due to\npresumed neoantigen paucity. However, systematic antigen discovery in PDAC is lacking.\n3% of PDAC patients survive > 5 years (long term survivors). As T cell immunity may explain this extreme\noutcome, they represent the ideal cohort for deep antigen discovery. Using genomic, molecular, and cellular\nimmunoprofiling, computational evolutionary modeling, and neoantigen discovery in these rare long term\nsurvivors (n=82), we have discovered that neoantigen quality, but not quantity, is prognostic of survival, and\nthat long term survivors evidence lasting neoantigen-specific T cell immunity. The scientific objectives of this\nproposal are to address questions essential to translate these findings - 1) is there stage and treatment-\nspecific neoantigen heterogeneity, 2) can neoantigens be identified in the peripheral blood, and 3) can\nneoantigen quality predict response to immunotherapy. The translational objective is to develop novel tissue\nand blood-based biomarkers for rational patient and target selection for immunotherapy.\nThe proposal utilizes several highly unique tissue collection strategies – a) laparoscopic multi-site biopsies to\nidentify stage-specific heterogeneity, b) serial pre- and post-chemotherapy assessment for treatment-specific\nmodulation, and c) evaluation of neoantigen quality as a predictive biomarker on a large, immunotherapeutic\nPDAC trial. This initiative will also for the first time develop the ability to identify neoantigens in circulating\nexosomes for blood-based biomarker assessment. The research methodology employs next generation\nsequencing, transcriptional profiling, computational biophysical modeling, clonotypic T cell profiling, neoantigen\ndiscovery, and functional assessments to evaluate the prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic potential of\nneoantigens. The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of\nhighly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill\nCornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute\nfor Advanced Study. This initiative is directly relevant to the primary objective to develop novel biomarkers and\nT cell antigenic targets for the successful application of immunotherapy in PDAC.

project	1U01CA224182-01	9450222	2017	Optimizing Novel Immunotherapy Combinations Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment in Canine Spontaneous Osteosarcoma	Grant	Project Abstract\nSpontaneous canine osteosarcoma (OS) is a well-defined large animal model of human OS, exhibiting similar\nclinical presentation and molecular aberrations. Indeed, canine OS has historically been used to help develop\nnovel limb spare techniques, evaluate a variety of non-specific immunotherapeutics such as L-MTP-PE, and\nassess the efficacy of targeted therapeutics to prevent the outgrowth of metastatic disease. Despite best efforts,\nprogress in the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease has essentially stalled for the past 3 decades;\n30% of people and 90% of dogs still die of tumor spread, primarily to the lungs. Numerous clinical trials have\nbeen undertaken in people with macroscopic metastases and in dogs with both microscopic and macroscopic\ndisease, yet all have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes. This is particularly evident with respect to\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors that do not induce the dramatic disease regressions typically observed in other\ncancers such as melanoma and lung cancer. One particularly daunting challenge for immunotherapy-based\ntherapeutics in OS relates to the permissiveness of the tumor microenvironment (TME) for inducing anti-tumor\nimmune responses. Our data suggests that a relatively low mutational load combined with a dampened overall\nimmune response in OS may contribute to the observed lack of response to current treatment approaches. We\npropose that targeting the immune suppressive TME in OS is essential to generating potent and durable anti-\ntumor immunity. To accomplish this, it may be necessary to simultaneously modulate several elements in the\nTME, including Tregs, MDSCs, M2 macrophages and overexpressed inhibitory checkpoint molecules. In support\nof this, we have generated a body of data demonstrating immunological activity of multiple therapeutics, including\nrepurposed drugs with good safety records (losartan, oclacitinib), small molecule inhibitors with established\nPK/PD in dogs (toceranib, RV1001, reparixin, JHU-292) and antibodies specific for checkpoint molecules (anti-\nPD1). However, the exact combinations that are most effective against metastatic OS have not yet been\nidentified, and this is a major goal of this proposal. As such, we hypothesize that an adaptive pilot trial design\ncan be used to rapidly screen TME-targeting immunotherapy drug combinations in dogs with\nmacroscopic chemotherapy-resistant metastatic OS and that this information can be refined to assess\nactivity of the most active approach against microscopic metastases in a subsequent adjuvant trial. This\nwill be accomplished by testing four TME modifying immunotherapy combinations for anti-tumor and immune\nmodulatory activity in dogs with macroscopic OS metastases, interrogating relevant biomarkers associated with\nresponses to therapy, then using this information to conduct an adjuvant immunotherapy trial with the most active\ncombination in dogs with microscopic metastatic OS. The data generated from this proposal will create a\nblueprint for future immunotherapy studies in people with OS by eliminating approaches deemed inactive\nand generating a set of clinical biomarkers to guide treatment.

project	1U01CA224193-01	9450411	2017	Disrupting the immune and drug-privileged microenvironment in pancreas cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) develop an intense fibroinflammatory infiltrate that helps promote\ndisease progression and therapeutic resistance. Recent progress has identified essential barriers in this\ncomplex microenvironment that impede drug delivery and suppress immunity. These processes include the\nprohibitive interstitial pressures generated by high concentrations of hyaluronan (HA) complexed with water,\ndense fibrosis associated with fibrillar collagen deposition, and multiple classes of immunosuppressive and\npro-tumorigenic cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and macrophages. The team assembled in this\nproject has made many of the seminal discoveries described above. In addition, we have developed several\nhighly novel and powerful experimental platforms to rigorously interrogate the complex mechanisms and\ninteractions among various compartments in the tumor microenvironment that collectively conspire to promote\nthe survival of pancreas cancers and metastases and thwart treatment. Our overarching hypothesis is that\nsignificantly improving survival for PDA patients will require targeting not only the tumor epithelial cell, but also\nthe three compartments that support its oncogenesis: hematopoietic, mesenchymal and extracellular matrix. In\nthe following, we propose to investigate the combination of cytotoxic therapy with stromal disruption and\nmyeloid cell modulations to maximize engagement of anti-tumor immunity and treatment efficacy. We will\npursue these investigations in four distinct experimental platforms that offer complementary strengths and\nmitigate limitations: 1) genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of autochthonous PDA; 2) syngeneic\nallografts; 3) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) systems; and 4) patient-derived organoids (PDO).

project	1U01CA224348-01	9457862	2017	Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy	Grant	We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n(PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan,\ncan enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS\n2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include “normalization” of cancer-associated\nfibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and\ndecreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at\nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy – FOLFIRINOX and\nthen chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this\ntrial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to\nresectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably,\ntranscriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only\nnormalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity\ninvolving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the\nPDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in\ncombination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive\nPDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs\nand cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had\nlimited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover\nhow losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood\nvessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug-\ninduced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically\nengineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment\nreprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on\nour preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our\nbench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will\npositively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have\na 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the\nknowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment\nin PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium. Through this work, we will develop innovative\napproaches to enhance anti-tumor immunity in this intractable disease.

project	1U24CA224020-01	9445275	2017	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC)	Grant	ABSTRACT\nIn contrast to the decline in mortality in other cancers, the incidence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n(PDAC) is increasing, and therapeutic approaches, for the most part, have not been successful at improving\nsurvival in patients. Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers,\ncomparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an\nimmune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune\nbarriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease.\nThe U01 “Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME” was created through the National Cancer\nMoonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC,\nespecially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24\nRFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal\nAdenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio\nWistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center\n(UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with\nrespect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental\ntherapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics),\nAndy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton\n(co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple\nareas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01\nawardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage\ncapabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing\ntranslationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support\nadministrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and\naccess to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will\nserve as the central “hub” for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we\nwill utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be\nreadily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics\nservices for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and\ndevelop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well\nas provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be\nan indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.

project	1U24CA224067-01	9446207	2017	Data Coordination Center for PDX Net	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nPatient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are a powerful model system for assessing drug efficacy of anti-cancer\nagents and understanding molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. However, results from individual\nresearch groups have been difficult to validate due to the lack of standardized PDX procedures, lack of scale\nfor adequately powered PDX studies and the inability to efficiently share PDX specimens. A key contributor to\nthis challenge is the lack of well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of\nintegrated, standardized datasets from PDX models. The JAX-Seven Bridges PDX Data Commons and\nCoordination Center (PDCCC) seeks to address this challenge and unite the efforts of the component data-\ngenerating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI’s Patient-Derived\nModel Repository/PDMR) parts of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research Network (PDXNet) into\na cohesive, trans-Network whole. Using innovative cloud computing and bioinformatic approaches, our\nPDCCC will provide administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX method\nstandardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. We will build a data storage,\nsharing, and analysis platform that harmonizes PDXNet data with other large datasets and analysis workflows\navailable in the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud. Simultaneously, we will administer planning meetings, training\nactivities, and research pilots to build synergies within the PDXNet, enhancing the ability of the PDXNet to\ndevelop clinical trials from PDX studies. Our Specific Aims are to 1) establish a leadership and\nadministration unit to manage and coordinate activities within PDXNet, including annual meetings,\nregular conference calls, training activities, trans-Network pilot projects, and outreach; 2) develop a cloud-\nintegrated PDXnet Data Commons that integrates PDXNet data with the existing cloud-based data analysis\nplatform - the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC); and 3) build analysis workflows and data\nsharing practices to optimize PDXNet research and enable PDXNet data to facilitate clinical trial design. To\naccomplish these Aims we have assembled a team with unique expertise in PDXs, cancer treatment, genomic\nanalysis, data coordination, and project management from The Jackson Laboratory and Seven Bridges. Our\ncombined institutional strengths include a history of leadership in (and commitment) to PDX, data resource,\nanalytic and consensus standards development and application; practical expertise in PDX model sharing and\ncollaborative community efforts; a broad array of statistical, bioinformatic, and software-related PDX resources;\nleadership expertise in large-scale, cloud-based biomedical data projects, notably the SB-CGC; and deep\nexperience in high-performance database engineering and development. Our goal is to build an innovative,\nsystematically organized PDCCC that will advance the efforts of PDXNet to improve the validity—and expand\nuse—of the PDX system as a preclinical platform for precision oncology.

project	1U24CA224122-01	9449147	2017	Coordinating Center for Canine Immunotherapy Trials and Correlative Studies	Grant	The primary mission of goal of the Pre-medical Cancer Immunotherapy Network for Canine Trials (PRECINCT) is to\nfacilitate the performance of immunotherapy clinical trials in dogs with cancer and to expedite the identification of\nimmunological correlates of successful therapeutic responses. The PRECINCT will achieve these goal by supporting\na highly coordinated clinical trials network of participating U01 sites. As a coordinating center, the PRECINCT will\nwork in consultation with U01 investigators, the Steering Committee, representatives from the Comparative\nOncology Program (COP) at NCI and an External Advisory Committee to provide expert services in project\nmanagement and research technology, data management, biostatistical support and immunological monitoring.\nSpecifically, we will establish a PRECINCT Data Coordinating Center to provide comprehensive project oversight,\nsupervise all project management and regulatory compliance activities, and coordinate site management for all\naspects of single and large multi-site projects. Through the PRECINCT, U01 investigators will have ready access to\nresearch services and standardized protocols that will facilitate the performance of clinical research across the\nPRECINCT. We will establish a PRECINCT Data Management System to collect, store and share all clinical and\ncorrelative data amongst the U01 sites and with the COP directors and Steering Committee. We will develop the\ninfrastructure necessary to achieve an efficient, highly functioning coordinated network and develop standard\noperating procedures (SOPs) that can be applied across all PRECINCT-associated U01 projects to ensure high\nquality, repeatable data sets. We will provide biostatistical support for study design and data analysis to ensure\nthat immunotherapy clinical trials performed within the network are strategically designed and appropriately\npowered to achieve meaningful clinical and laboratory data results in the most expedite way. The renowned\nexpertise of the University of Pennsylvania in both human and canine clinical trials will foster rapid translation of\nstate-of-the art methods for human clinical study design and analysis to canine clinical trials and results from\ncanine trials can rapidly inform human clinical trials, thus optimizing results for both species. Finally, the University\nof Pennsylvania is a leader in cancer immunotherapy and is also home to world renowned experts in immune\nreagent development and immunological monitoring. We will leverage this expertise to both accelerate the\nmission of the U24 and extend it by providing support for immunologic reagent development for use in correlative\nstudies and biomarker identification. In concert with U01 investigators, the COP and the Steering Committee, we\nwill design, generate and validate several multiparametric, multicolor flow panels and SOPs for their use across the\nU01 sites. Successful immunologic monitoring will allow canine cancer patients to be streamlined to single or\ncombination therapies most likely to be effective and will provide essential insight for future translational\napplication to human cancer patients.

project	1U24CA224285-01	9455402	2017	Translational Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (TCIMAC)	Grant	ABSTRACT\nAdvances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various cancers. Immunotherapeutic approaches are\nbecoming the new treatment modality in some cancer types. However, clinical efficacy is still limited to a\nmarginal number of patients due to a newly developing understanding of the complex tumor microenvironment\nand a limited ability to appropriately select patients who have specific biomarker signatures and have the\npotential to optimally respond to specific immunotherapy or combination strategies. An additional challenge in\nassessment of biomarkers that show clinical utility to predict patient benefit includes the use of different\nmethodologies and platforms that make it difficult to make accurate conclusions on the biomarkers in question.\nThus, optimized biomarker strategies that can overcome immune barriers will allow tailoring of the therapeutic\napproaches and result in bold interventions that would be most beneficial to individual patients. The National\nCancer Moonshot was launched in 2016 with the goal of boldly combating cancer beyond incremental\nadvances leading to the creation of a “Cancer Immunotherapy Translational Science Network” that would\nfacilitate translational research and clinical advances in immunotherapy.  Our proposal to create a resource\ncenter, named Translational Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (TCIMAC) that will be a\ncritical resource capable of serving any of the NCI-supported clinical trial networks. The TCIMAC will be co-led\nby Drs. Ignacio Wistuba, renowned cancer surgical and molecular pathologist, Elizabeth Mittendorf, well-known\nbreast cancer surgeon and immunologist, and Chantale Bernatchez, cancer immunologist. They will be\nsupported by a team that encompasses a multidisciplinary group of world-class and highly collaborative\nexperts on cancer and immunotherapy. The main goals of TCIMAC are to: 1) provide centralized and\nharmonized services for sample collection, processing and quality assurance, and 2) use analytically-validated\nand standardized assays and platforms to offer state-of-the-art analyses for patients enrolled on NCI-\nsponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will assist in standardizing bio-banking\nactivities and share/develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing,\nquality assessment, and storage of biospecimens collected from NCI-sponsored early phase immunotherapy\nclinical trials and to link the specimens to relevant clinical, pathological, immune and molecular data within the\nTCIMAC-CIDC Network. In Aim 2, we will provide services to conduct both routine and innovative pathological,\nimmunological and molecular analyses using standardized and validated assays to aid the completion of NCI-\nsponsored trials. In Aim 3, we will provide comprehensive biostatistics and computational services for data\ncollection and analysis for each analytical platform, and to perform analyses, interpretation and predictive\nmodeling of high dimensional (`omic”) data in the context of clinical outcomes. We envision that the TCIMAC\nwill be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress in cancer immunotherapeutic approaches.

project	1U24CA224316-01	9456997	2017	Cancer Immunologic Data Commons	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nCancer immunotherapies have emerged as highly promising approaches to treat cancer patients, particularly\nsince they can be applied across different tissue and cancer types, although clinical efficacy has been limited\nto a subset of cancer patients. Translational studies with strong focus on biomarkers are critical to\nunderstanding the tumor-immune interface. Although numerous technologies for tumor and immune profiling\nare applied to NCI sponsored immunotherapy trials, standardization of both assay protocols and data analysis\nmethods is crucial to data integration and comparisons across studies for biomarker identification. This\nunderlines the need for data harmonization and creation of uniform analysis pipelines.\nWe propose to establish the Cancer Immunology Data Commons (CIDC) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\nwith the goal of advancing translational research efforts using biomarkers to aid in the further\ndevelopment of cancer immunotherapy. The short-term objectives of this application are to establish and\nmanage the data repository for biomarkers and associated clinical data for Cancer Immune Monitoring\nand Analysis Centers (CIMACs), and provide an informatics environment for integrative multi-\ndimensional analysis across different studies and storage of data generated. Specifically, we propose to:\nAim 1, coordinate with the CIMAC and Laboratory Coordinating Committee (LCC) to harmonize establish\nassay protocols and data format standards; Aim 2, develop a centralized data repository and management\nsystem, and coordinate CIMAC data submission to the CIDC; Aim 3, develop uniform bioinformatics\nprocessing pipelines and computing infrastructure for computationally intensive analyses for the CIMACs and\nthe larger research community; Aim 4, provide bioinformatics algorithms to enable integrative and correlative\nanalysis of CIMAC data and integrate other accessible databases and resources for biomarker discovery; Aim\n5, develop centralized role-based data access functions with advanced programming interface to enable\nsharing of CIMAC data; Aim 6, develop interactive web visualization functions to enable investigators and the\nimmunology communities to examine the CIMAC data; and Aim 7, coordinate within the CIMACs-CIDC\nNetwork logistic and scientific activities for biomarker discovery and validation.\nAt the conclusion, we will have established a biomarker repository for all data and results generated by\nCIMACs, supplemented with standardized informatics tools for integration with other accessible databases,\nand compatible for data contribution and secondary analyses by external researchers. These efforts will\nprovide bioinformatics support for the CIMACs-CIDC Network. The established Data Commons will also\nprovide the foundation for a future immuno-oncology data resource for the larger research community.

project	1U24CA224319-01	9457012	2017	High-Dimensional Immune Monitoring of NCI-Supported Immunotherapy Trials	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nImmunotherapy is transforming decades of clinical practice in cancer care, but it also comes with new\nquestions about understanding mechanisms of action contributing to both antitumor activity and potential\nassociated toxicity. Most importantly, identifying why only a fraction of patients derives clinical benefit is at the\nforefront of future developments, with the ever-elusive validation of useful clinical biomarkers as the ultimate\ngoal. As a consortium of immunologists, technologists, clinicians, computational biologists, data specialists,\nand biostatisticians, the Mount Sinai CIMAC (MS-CIMAC) is uniquely positioned to generate immune profiling\ndatasets at an unprecedented level of granularity to identify biomarker signatures of disease course and\nresponse to immunotherapy in cancer patients. MS-CIMAC will take full advantage of the smart cancer\nimmunotherapy trial designs championed by the NCI that mandate collection of baseline and on-treatment\nbiospecimens. Key strengths of MS-CIMAC are expected to be in unique high-dimensional yet sample-sparing\napproaches, including CyTOF mass cytometry, seromics, microbiome, and multiplex chromogen IHC, thanks\nto the implementation of cutting-edge yet validated protocols and analysis pipelines. Through a comprehensive\narray of assays and analytical tools that bridge innovation and standardization, MS-CIMAC intends to pursue\nthe following three aims: a) help characterize immunocompetence at baseline and assess global immune\nchanges during treatment, b) drill down the specificity and quality of immune responses for mechanistic\nevaluation of drugs, and c) automate, optimize, and integrate analyses of resulting datasets to facilitate\nsharing, and to ultimately discover composite immune biomarkers that will impact clinical cancer care.

project	1U24CA224331-01	9457104	2017	Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center	Grant	Summary\nThe critical role of the immune system in effecting anti-tumor responses to traditional and molecularly-targeted\ntherapies is increasingly recognized, such that there is now an explosion of activity in the clinical investigation\nof immuno-oncology. In parallel, we have gained great advances in our ability to extract useful biologic\ninformation from patient material through the development of: (i) high-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing, that\nhas uncovered major genetic determinants of clinically-evident immune responses; (ii) highly multiplexed\nbiological assays, that have revealed the complex interplay between immunity and cancer in relation to\ntherapy; and (iii) advanced computational methods, that have enabled large-scale integrative data analysis.\nUnderlying this activity is a need to identify the critical biomarkers of response and resistance to\ntherapy in each disease and across diseases. With the rapidly evolving clinical and experimental\ndevelopments in immunotherapy occurring across all major academic centers, the need to build a coordinated\ninfrastructure for data collection, processing and analysis has emerged as a high priority. At Dana-Farber\nCancer Institute (DFCI), the Center of Immuno-Oncology (CIO) was established several years ago and is a\nlocal hub of translational immuno-oncology activity. As a part of its mission, the CIO supports dedicated\ntranslational biomarker laboratories to provide expertise in the analysis of immune correlatives in the service of\nimmuno-oncology trials. Collectively, these resources provide multidisciplinary capabilities supporting both\ninvestigator-initiated and externally-sponsored studies ranging from clinical trial design, the performance of\nwell-validated immune monitoring capabilities on patient samples during trials, the interpretation of data from\nimmune monitoring testing, and the development of novel assays based on the scientific questions motivated\nby individual clinical studies. We propose to expand the laboratory and biostatistical capabilities of the\nCIO along with those of additional DFCI units as a Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center\n(CIMAC). We want to coordinate the efforts of the proposed DFCI-CIMAC with other CIMACs and with the\nCancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) to develop the standards for designing studies rich with immune\ncorrelatives and informative for candidate biomarkers, to be tested in future trials. Aim 1 focuses on\nharmonizing the technical aspects of assays offered by the CIMACs; Aim 2 focuses on the assay-specific\nscoring analyses and reporting of CIMAC offerings. Modeled on our long history of implementing standard and\ninnovative assays to study DFCI phase I/II trials, we describe a process for using `Tier 1' `shovel-ready' assays\nthat we expect as standard components of an immune monitoring tool-kit and `Tier 2' assays that are tailored\nto the specific needs of a study (Aim 3). Altogether, these efforts fall within the concept and vision of\npersonalized medicine for immuno-oncology because only by the analyses of large well-annotated datasets\ncan we identify links between biology, molecular markers and clinical response.

project	1U54CA224018-01	9444850	2017	Overcoming Drug Resistance in Multiple Myeloma	Grant	OVERALL ABSTRACT\nMM is a plasma cell neoplasm within the bone marrow with significant complexity and\nheterogeneity at the molecular level. Despite improvements in the clinical outcomes\nachieved with newer therapies, wide inter-individual variation in response to treatment is\na major limitation in achieving consistent therapeutic effects, or cures. Not all patients\nrespond to initial therapies (innate resistance), and those that do frequently relapse with\nrefractory disease (acquired resistance). The central hypothesis we are addressing is\nthat rational therapeutic development in MM should be based on an understanding of the\nunderlying genetics and biology of the tumor that identify sensitivity and resistance to\ncurrent and future drugs. In this Myeloma-DRSC we are proposing 3 Projects that will:\n1) develop a high throughput drug screening platform for myeloma cell lines representing\nthe wide diversity of MM biology; and use this platform to screen primary patient tumor\ncells for most effective responses, including combination therapies; 2) develop a\ncomprehensive mutational and germline variation panel that will be correlated to drug\nresponses in vitro and in vivo, as well as toxicities; 3) identify the mechanism of\nresponse and resistance for two of the most common therapeutics used in MM\ntreatment: IMiDS and proteasome inhibitors; 4) develop genetic and immunophenotypic\nsignatures that effectively predict tumor response, resistance, and patient toxicities; 5)\nidentify tumor sub-populations that may contribute to emerging resistance; and 6)\nidentify strategies to predict drug resistance and approaches to overcome resistance.

project	1U54CA224019-01	9444898	2017	Tumor Intrinsic and Microenvironmental Mechanisms Driving Drug Combination Efficacy and Resistance in AML	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common hematologic malignancies, representing a diverse\ncollection of complex diseases. Treatment strategies for AML have not changed in 30-40 years. Single-agent\ntargeted therapies based on AML genetics or microenvironmental disease features have been disappointing, at\nbest. The investigators on this DRSC Program, Drug Combinations to Circumvent Resistance (D2CR), have\ncollaborated for over a decade and have developed functional genomic pipelines for evaluation of primary AML\npatient samples that have collectively led to numerous discoveries with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.\nFor this Program, our long-term goals are to translate effective drug combinations that target tumor-\nintrinsic and microenvironmental pathways into the clinic for patients with AML. Our immediate goals\nare to prioritize the most relevant tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways for each AML\ndisease subset and establish sufficient preclinical data to facilitate immediate clinical investigation of\ndrug combinations. Based on the central hypothesis that drug combinations targeting tumor intrinsic\nand extrinsic features of AML biology will be essential to the development of more effective and\ndurable therapeutic strategies, we predict that the drug combinations established by this D2CR-DRSC\nProgram will substantially improve outcomes for patients with AML. To accomplish these goals, 3\nProjects are proposed: 1) What are the tumor-intrinsic genes and pathways that contribute to drug sensitivity\nand resistance? Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screens on parental and drug-resistant AML cells will be\nintegrated with computational analysis of the largest functional genomic AML cohort in the world. The result will\nnominate genes/pathways for validation on patient samples in gene-edited models and for drug combination\nstudies in Project 3. 2) What are the tumor-extrinsic pathways promoting tumor cell growth, drug resistance,\nand immune suppression? Inflammatory cytokine profiling of our large bank of AML patient samples will be\nconducted. Our bank of AML patient bone marrow stromal cells will also be accessed for studies of the reactive\nsignature of these stromal cells when exposed to specific drugs. Finally, high-parameter immunophenotyping\nand T-cell functional assays will be used to define the immune landscape with candidate drugs tested in an\nimmune-competent, spontaneous mouse model of AML. Candidate targets will be nominated for combination\nstudies with tumor-intrinsic targets. 3) What are the drug combinations that most effectively bridge tumor-\nintrinsic and microenvironmental biology to eliminate AML cells and circumvent resistance? Drug combinations\nfrom targets nominated in Project 1 and 2 will be tested ex vivo on primary AML patient samples and in vivo\nusing AML patient-derived xenografts. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a major\nimpact on our understanding of AML biology, with successful clinical translation of new, more effective drug\ncombination strategies.

project	1U54CA224068-01	9446211	2017	An integrated translational approach to overcome drug resistance	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL)\nDrug resistance represents one of the most critical obstacles to clinical benefit for cancer patients. Due to the\nsize and complexity of this challenge, we believe a collaborative team approach is critical and have assembled\na team of drug resistance experts from three leading institutions (MGH, the Broad Institute, and MIT/Koch\nInstitute) with an exceptional track record of impactful discoveries in this field. We propose an integrated full-\nspectrum translational platform—including liquid biopsy, patient-derived tumor models, exome and\ntranscriptome sequencing of tumor tissue, rapid autopsy, functional genomic screens, innovative preclinical\nmouse models, and a high-throughput combination drug-screening platform covering the CTEP portfolio—to\naddress critical principles of drug resistance across several major cancer types—lung, melanoma and GI\ncancers, which impact a large percentage of cancer patients. Overall, these three projects will focus on the\ncommon theme of bypass resistance mechanisms, a critical ad frequent mechanism of therapeutic resistance\nthat can involve both genetic and adaptive resistance mechanisms that “bypass” the effects of therapy, and\nwhich can drive both intrinsic and acquired resistance. To maximize the potential impact on cancer patients we\nwill focus projects on three major tumor types—lung, melanoma and GI cancers—with each project integrating\nat least two tumor types. We will focus our projects on defining and overcoming key bypass resistance\nmechanisms to three of the most critical classes of cancer therapeutics: MAPK inhibitors, RTK inhibitors, and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors. While each project will focus on a specific therapy and at least two specific\ncancer types, we believe the overall program design can be readily applied to additional agents and\nmolecularly-defined cancers, such that the ultimate impact of this work will go beyond the specific studies\nproposed and will serve as a “blueprint” for critical discoveries related to drug resistance. We anticipate that\nthese efforts will define a new standard in our mechanistic understanding of bypass resistance mechanisms\nand will lead to novel opportunities to overcome them in the clinic. Our proposed approach will provide a\nsteady stream of novel therapeutic strategies involving CTEP agents and pathways for evaluation in future\nclinical trials, as well as new potential agents for the CTEP portfolio. We have also integrated cutting-edge\nstrategies for real-time blood-based monitoring of response and resistance to help guide innovative trial\ndesign.

project	1U54CA224070-01	9446221	2017	Rational approaches to melanoma therapy	Grant	Project Summary – Overall\nThe outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma have improved dramatically over the last decade due to an\nimproved understanding of the molecular drivers of this disease. In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens\nhave been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas.\nThese treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof-\nof-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will\nprogress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been\nshown to be effective in patients with a wild-type BRAF. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments\nthat prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are\neffective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies,\nover the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical,\nhistological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of >450 PDX models represents one of the\nlargest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately\nrecapituluates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also\nincludes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been\nmaintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a\nrobust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we\npropose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued\nexpansion of our robutst melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical\ngaps in this disease. Project 1 will characterize kinase inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the\nPI3K-AKT pathway in combination with approved targeted therapies in PDX models in treatment-naïve and drug-\nresistant BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanomas. Project 2 will characterize targeting the apoptotic machinery of cancer\ncells as a combinatorial approach with MAPK pathway inhibitors in PDX with and without BRAFV600E/K mutations,\nincluding in subsets with aberrancies in anti-apoptotic genes. Both Projects will utilize baseline characteristics of the\nPDX models to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to guide personalized patient selection for\nfuture clinical testing. In addition, tumors will be analyzed for treatment-induced effects that correlate with sensitivity\nto identified resistance mechanisms and potential new combinatorial strategies. Finally, markers identified in the\npreclinical models will be compared to parallel biomarker studies of metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in\nclinical trials utilizing the same agents. These studies will be supported by the PDX, Bioinformatics, and\nAdministrative Cores to ensure their success, along with a Pilot Project program to open new areas of investigation.\nTogether these studies will have high potential to translate into new personalized clinical trials for patients.\n1	Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Area;BRAF gene;Bioinformatics;Biologic Characteristic;Biological Markers;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program;Cell Line;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collection;Cutaneous Melanoma;DNA;DNA Damage;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Drug resistance;Enrollment;Ensure;FDA approved;Fine needle aspiration biopsy;Foundations;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Heterogeneity;Heterogeneity;Histologic;Human;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immunodeficient Mouse;Immunotherapeutic agent;Institution;Investigation;Laboratories;Lesion;MAP Kinase Gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Melanoma Cell;Metastatic Melanoma;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Patient Selection;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Pilot Projects;Pre-Clinical Model;Property;Proteins;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;RNA;Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases;Regimen;Relapse;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Resources;Selection for Treatments;Signal Transduction;Solid;Specimen;Subgroup;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Translating;Tumor stage;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;cancer cell;combinatorial;disease heterogeneity;effective therapy;established cell line;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;kinase inhibitor;melanoma;multidisciplinary;mutant;novel drug combination;novel marker;novel therapeutic intervention;patient subsets;personalized medicine;personalized therapeutic;potential biomarker;prevent;programs;research clinical testing;resistance mechanism;response;success;targeted treatment;tool;tumor;tumor progression	WISTAR INSTITUTE	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	Michael  Davies,Meenhard F Herlyn	DCTD	Jeffrey Arnold Moscow	2885586	2885586	2017-09-25T04:00:00Z	2017-09-30T04:00:00Z	2019-08-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-17-003	Moonshot
project	1U54CA224079-01	9446574	2017	The MSKCC-UW/Fred Hutch Prostate Cancer Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center	Grant	OVERALL ABSTRACT\nThe lethal stage of metastatic prostate cancer, called castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), kills\n~26,000 men per year in the US. Despite remarkable improvements in survival with next generation AR\npathway inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, CRPC patients ultimately progress and die from\ntheir disease. Our understanding of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to AR therapy has increased\ndramatically in recent years, largely based on genomic landscape analyses of tumors from CRPC patients and\npreclinical studies of acquired resistance in patient-derived models (organoids, PDX). Much of this progress is\ndirectly linked to the members of this Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center (DRSC) team. A major\nmechanistic insight from these studies is the recognition of two categories of AR therapy resistance: one in\nwhich AR pathway signaling is restored and the other in which it remains inhibited. Underlying both categories\nare a heterogeneous set of resistance mechanisms, many of which were discovered by our DRSC team\nmembers. Importantly, we have shown that several of these resistance mechanisms can be targeted with\ncurrent clinical grade drugs. The overarching goal of this DRSC proposal is to evaluate these translational\nopportunities across a unique set of preclinical organoid and PDX models (again, discovered and developed by\nour DRSC team members) and to catalyze the initiation of clinical studies in patients most likely to benefit\nbased on appropriate biomarker profiles. We address this goal in three Projects. Project 1 focuses on\nresistance caused by restored AR pathway function, which occurs in over ~50% of CRPC patients, by targeting\nthe glucocorticoid receptor, which is upregulated and substitutes for AR, or by further inhibition of AR signaling\nusing drugs targeting specific components of the chromatin machinery. Project 2 will take a similar approach\nbut will focus on the opposite category of acquired resistance (absence of restored AR pathway activity),\nleveraging insights from our recent data showing that cancer can revert from an AR-negative to AR-positive\nstate by targeting specific chromatin modifiers. Project 3 integrates with Projects 1 and 2 by focusing on\nkinase inhibitors as an adjunct to AR pathway therapy in two distinct contexts – PI3K/AKT activation in tumors\nwith PTEN loss and FGFR activation in tumors with autocrine FGF8/FGF9 production. Excitingly, a recent\nclinical trial of combined AKT and AR inhibition, which was initiated based on our earlier work, demonstrated a\nsignificant improvement in survival for patients with PTEN loss prostate cancer. The Administrative Core will\noversee the integration of the Projects with each other, with NCI scientific staff and with other DRSCs.\nCollectively our studies will validate various combination therapy regimens, in conjunction with molecular\nbiomarkers for patient selection, as a critical step toward clinical translation. In addition, the drugs and targets\nstudied here are broadly relevant for multiple cancer types.

project	1U54CA224081-01	9446620	2017	Bay Area Team Against Resistance	Grant	PROJECT ABSTRACT\nThe proposed Bay Area Team Against Resistance U54 Project (BATAR-UP) is an interdisciplinary effort of\ninvestigators to apply their knowledge and expertise to dissect the molecular and cellular basis of incomplete\nresponse and resistance to current treatments and to identify new treatment strategies to better neutralize or\neliminate residual disease and prevent resistance. This translational approach will be part of the NCI's Drug\nResistance and Sensitivity Centers Network to develop innovative strategies to understand and combat\nmechanisms of tumor resistance and exploit tumor sensitivity to anti-cancer therapies.\n To accomplish this, BATAR-UP will support two projects and one core driven by a multidisciplinary\nteam of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University. Project 1 will define and interrogate the molecular and\ncellular basis of residual disease in lung cancers treated with targeted inhibitors in clinical use. We will prioritize\nfor initial study both EGFR-mutant and ALK gene rearrangement positive lung cancers, given their importance\nas key molecular disease subtypes and our prior published work and expertise. We will harness genetic and\ntranscriptomic analysis of clinical samples (liquid and tumor biopsies) to provide a molecular view of the\nevolution of response, residual disease, and acquired resistance. We will generate organoid and PDX models\nand apply cutting-edge functional screens (genetic, pharmacologic, and targeted proteomic assays) to identify\nkey vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited, including with CTEP agents. This systematic\napproach will allow us to reveal the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that drives EGFR\nand ALK inhibitor resistance and pinpoint therapeutic strategies to intercept the evolution of residual disease\nand eventual acquired resistance. Project 2 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of\nresistance and residual disease in lung cancers treated with current immunotherapies, including PD-1 and PD-\nL1 antibodies. Leveraging shared platforms in synergy with Project 1, we will perform systematic analyses of\nliquid and tumor biopsy specimens (and ex vivo models) obtained from patients longitudinally before and\nduring treatment and upon acquired resistance. We will focus our studies on EGFR and ALK wild type patients,\nincluding squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma patients where immunotherapy has shown efficacy\nbut is typically non-curative. We will leverage (1) a novel lung cancer organoid model wherein tumor biopsies\nare cultured as both tumor epithelium and their endogenous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) en bloc as a\ncohesive unit, and (2) deep droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq analysis.

project	1U54CA224083-01	9446705	2017	Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract: Overall\nWith the discovery of a number of new molecular targets and exponential increase in the number of anti-cancer\nagents, it has become imperative to optimize preclinical models in order to design rational clinical trials.\nRecognizing the unique advantage of the patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) models in drug testing and\npersonalized medicine, physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and\nthe Siteman Cancer Center have been actively generating and utilizing PDX models for cancer research and\nthe evaluation of molecularly targeted agents. Building on our strength and existing infrastructure, we propose\nto establish the Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center (WU-PDTC), as part of PDXNet\nprogram, to promote preclinical testing in a collaborative nation-wide effort.\nThe PDX core within WU-PDTC will develop and characterize at least 1000 new pathogen-free PDX models\nacross major tumor types. The PDX models will be genomically and phenotypically characterized using the\nlatest `omics technologies and expertly analyzed using the most current data analysis pipelines that have been\ndeployed for other large scale NCI programs. The Bioinformatics Core will integrate these analyzes with clinical\nannotation from the originating patient to include patient treatment history and tumor response (Aim 1). Our two\nresearch projects will conduct PDX clinical trials using single agent and combinational agents using drugs\nunder NCI-IND (Aim 2). Project 1 will test pan- or beta isoform specific class I PI3K inhibitors in over 100\nbreast PDX models while Project 2 will study combinatorial approaches that overcome tumor intrinsic and\nextrinsic mechanisms to ERK inhibition in over 100 already available pancreatic PDX models. Proteogenomic\nand clinical response data will be collected in these models, as part of a broader effort of characterizing PDX\nmodels and conducting clinical correlation and treatment response analyses by the Bioinformatics Core (Aim\n3). All relevant information, including proteogenomic features of PDX models and treatment/response history,\nwill be tracked in a dedicated relational database that will be accessible to PDXNet and PDMR-FNLCR. The\ngoal is to identify candidates for human clinical trials for the ET-CTN. In Aim 4, the WU-PDTC will leverage\nexisting expertise and programs from the NCI-designated Comprehensive Siteman Cancer Center, Institute of\nClinical and Translational Research (ITCS), McDonnell Genome Institute, Mallinkrodt Imaging Research\nCenter, and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN) to support the goals of developing and utilizing\nPDX models to test and improve cancer treatment, in collaboration with other components of the PDXNet.\nFinally, WU-PDTC, through coordination by the Administration Core, will support pilot research projects\nutilizing the PDX resources and fostering collaboration across PDTCs, PNMR-FNLCR, and other NCI\nprograms. The goal is to increase the spectrum of agents tested in PDX clinical trials and to improve the\nreliability, validation, utility, and standardization of PDX models through innovative Cross-PDXNet research.\nOur demonstrated capability in generating and utilizing PDX models, extensive existing infrastructure, and\nstrong institutional commitment set a solid foundation for a successful PDTC that will help achieve goals set by\nNCI in advancing the use of PDX models in preclinical testing.

project	2UM1CA154967-07	9452526	2017	Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network Central Operations and Statistical Center	Grant	Project Summary\nThe Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN) came about from discussions at the 2007 NCI\nImmunotherapy Agent Workshop, in which high-priority agents were identified that showed the potential to\nbenefit patients with cancer—but that were not yet broadly available for investigator-initiated trials (IITs). Since\n2007, a sea change has occurred in the field of cancer immunotherapy, resulting from the success of anti-PD1\nand anti-PD-L1. However, most of the priority agents identified in the NCI Workshop are still not broadly\navailable for academic IITs.\nSince the original award in 2011, the CITN focused on testing these high-priority agents, including 5 of the top\n8 ranked agents that hit targets critical for optimal immune responses. CITN trials are among the few academic\nIITs of these agents, and each trial has defined biologic and therapeutic principles. Two trials have led to\nchanges in clinical practice. The abbreviated Specific Aims for the CITN are as follows:\nAim 1: (a) to continue to conduct innovative early phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for adult cancers\nusing high-priority immunomodulatory agents; (b) to form a Pediatric CITN (PedCITN) to conduct innovative\nearly phase multicenter immunotherapy trials for pediatric cancers using high-priority immunomodulatory\nagents; (c) to provide leadership, infrastructure, and statistical support for the conduct of these clinical trials;\n(d) to continue to access high-priority agents central to immune responses and not broadly available for IITs\nAim 2: to coordinate studies with Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (CIMAC) and other labs for\nspecimen analysis (immune monitoring, biomarker credentialing) of adult and pediatric patients on CITN trials\nScientific Goals of the CITN\n1. Continue trials with T cell and natural killer cell activator and growth factor IL-15, homeostatic T cell growth\n factor IL-7, dendritic cell activator anti-CD40, dendritic cell growth factor Flt3L, and IDO inhibitor ± anti-PD1\n2. Continue trials with anti-PD1 for orphan and ultra-orphan indications, including pediatric cancers\n3. Conduct biopsy-intense trials to identify actionable causes of anti-PD1 failure and linked to therapeutic\n administration of potential rescue agents\n4. Conduct trials to assess therapies that eliminate or activate the myeloid, monocytes/macrophage, and/or\n myeloid-derived suppressor cells that reside within most cancers\n5. Conduct multicenter Phase I and early Phase II immunotherapy trials for pediatric patients with cancer\nThe results will inform future trial designs and improve the understanding of these high-priority agents. CITN\ntrials are designed to identify paths to regulatory approval and will likely change standard practice or spur\nconfirmatory pivotal trials by NCI cooperative groups and industry for adult and pediatric cancers.

project	3R00CA181500-04S1	9461345	2017	The Role of Protein Tyrosine Phosphate PRL3 in Leukemia Development	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aggressive and unpredictable nature of relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) represents a major clinical challenge, in large part due to highly toxic and ineffective chemotherapies. Further advances in therapy will require a detailed understanding of the molecular underpinnings of T- ALL development and relapse. To this end, I have completed a highly innovative screen in zebrafish to identify genes associated with T-ALL progression and have found that the protein tyrosine phosphotase PRL-3 was commonly amplified in single T-ALL cells as they developed increased ability to form relapse over time. In transgenic animals, PRL-3 over-expression significantly enhanced primary T-ALL development and relapse formation. I have found that PRL-3 amplified in a subset of human T-ALL and is highly expressed by a majority of T-ALL patient samples. These cells are also sensitive to PRL-3 knock-down through the induction of apoptosis. These results imply that PRL-3 activity has an important role in T-ALL malignancy, and that PRL-3 and its substrates may represent novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of T-ALL. The objectives of this proposal are to 1) define the contribution of PRL-3 to T- ALL progression and relapse and 2) identify the mechanism by which PRL-3 drives T-ALL malignancy. This objective will be achieved through two specific aims. During the K99 phase of this award, I will complete Aim 1, where I will examine the effect of PRL-3 gain-of-function and loss-of-function in various stages of T-ALL development in zebrafish, including invasion from the thymus, intravasation, proliferation and relapse, and I will also test the effects of PRL-3 knock-down on human cells in a murine xenograft model. During this phase, I will learn techniques to directly image cancer progression in live animals and to develop orthotopic leukemia xenografts in mice. With this knowledge in hand, during the R00 phase I will complete Aim 2, where I will identify the target substrates of PRL-3 in T-ALL cells, and test the contribution of these genes and pathways to T-ALL malignancy using in vivo and in vitro epistasis experiments. In total, this work will lay the foundation for the development of small molecule PRL-3 and pathway inhibitors for potential therapeutic use in T-ALL. The mentored phase of this award will occur under the guidance of Dr. David Langenau, an expert in zebrafish models of cancer, and Dr. Thomas Look, an internationally recognized leader in the field of leukemia research. Their proven track record of mentorship, coupled with an intensive didactic component and the rigorous and nurturing academic environment offered by the research community of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School offer the best opportunity for my success as I transition to becoming an independent investigator.

project	3R01CA182543-05S2	9445128	2017	Biosensor Assay to Screen for Signaling Pathway Inhibition in Cancer	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kinase inhibitors created a new paradigm in chemotherapy and are a major focus of new oncology drug development, but developmental success rates are low (5-10%). Resistance to kinase inhibitors occurs through target-dependent mechanisms (e.g. point mutations that abrogate drug binding) and target-independent mechanisms (e.g. upregulation of alternative signaling pathways, termed "kinome reprogramming"). Therefore, combinations of inhibitors that target several kinases at once are desirable to have a better chance of avoiding the resistance/relapse cycle. Detecting protein kinase activity inside living cells (rather than in lysates or reconstituted systems) is important or understanding kinase inhibitor drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and would lead to better screening for inhibitors likely to make it through the development process. We will develop multiplexed, cell-based assays for specific kinase activities that are important to inhibitor response and kinome reprogramming, and use them to detect kinase activation profiles in patient cells and for inhibitor screens. Phosphorylation of the biosensors is detected using time-resolved lanthanide luminescence measurements, in which Tb3+ emission energy is measured directly via small molecule fluorophores to give different emission colors depending on the fluorophore. In Aim 1, we will establish quantitative assays for activity (and therefore inhibition) of key kinases in drug sensitive and drug resistant CML cells, profiling the pathway activation phenotypes in therapeutically relevant cellular states. We will use the set of biosensors we have already established in preliminary work, and add biosensors for other kinases as they are developed. The assays will be established with cell lines and samples from CML patients (comparing to healthy controls), and validated with RT-qPCR and SWATH" proteomics. In Aim 2, we will screen for synergies between existing kinase inhibitor drugs and new compounds (via libraries). We will also develop homogenous multiplexed analysis of biosensor phosphorylation using energy transfer from lanthanides to organic dyes. In Aim 3, we expand the biosensor design pipeline to develop new, non-natural peptide substrates to use as biosensors for other kinases. The work described in this aim will add to the set of biosensors we already have available. Completion of the work described in this proposal will give us a novel assay for multiple kinases, a suite of new biosensors as well as new and refined detection strategies to use in screening. Drug discovery will benefit from this technology's ability to address kinome reprogramming mechanisms by targeting several kinases at a time. Drug development will benefit from companion assays for multiple targets that could follow a drug or drug combination through the hit to lead transition, target validation, pre-clinical studies, clinial trials, and beyond into treatment management. This assay and its associated tools will contribute to the next generation of targeted therapy development in cancer by breaking new ground in our ability to model the disease environment during drug screening and development.

project	3R01CA187532-03S1	9461334	2017	Imaging Habitats in Sarcoma	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tissue cancers, with over 50 histological sub-types. Regardless of type, virtually all STS are treated the same; i.e. with doxorubicin (DOX) followed by resection, if possible. More than 20% of STS are non-resectable and, of those that are, more than 20% recur. For non-resectable or recurring patients, median survival is a dismal 18 months. Perhaps because of its rarity, no new front-line agents have been developed for STS in decades. Among newer agents being developed for STS, TH-302 is showing exceptional promise. TH-302 is an alkylating pro-drug that is activated only in regions of severe hypoxia, and is currently in a phas III trial in combination with DOX in unresectable STS. The primary endpoint of this trial is overal survival with a secondary endpoint of objective radiological response with RECIST 1.1. RECIST responses rarely correlate with survival responses in soft tissue sarcomas, however. The purpose of this work is to develop MR imaging biomarkers that can predict response to DOX and/or TH-302, with the overarching hypothesis that distinct MRI-defined sub-regions of tumors will have differential responses to these agents. Because these sub-regions are defined by their distinct physiology illuminated by combining multiple MR scans, we have termed these as distinct "habitats". Because TH-302 is active only in hypoxia, and hypoxia should be represented by a specific habitat, we specifically hypothesize that imaging of the hypoxic habitat can be used to predict and monitor responses to TH-302. The hypoxia habitat is classified as having low perfusion and high cell density. In contrast, the DOX-responsive habitat should be well perfused (yielding higher drug concentrations) and have high cell density (with more drug targets). This represents a conceptual advance as such habitats may provide a common predictive biomarker across the multiple histological sub-types of STS for patient stratification and therapeutic decision support. The approach will follow on preliminary work, wherein delineated habitats were quantitatively identified across multiple histological types and grades of\nSTS by combining T1, contrast- enhanced T1, and T2 STIR MR images. The current proposal is entirely pre-clinical, with the expectation that findings herein can be rapidly translated to clinial care. Preclinical work is justified in that there is greater flexibility to interrogate a wider porfolio of MRI pulse sequences and treatment strategies that can be related to underlying histology and molecular profiling. Aim 1 will quantitatively compare MR-visible habitats to histology and molecular profiles of xenotransplanted tumors. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that tumors with different habitat profiles will be differentially responsive to DOX and/or TH-302. In Aim 3, we wil investigate the effects of metabolic perturbations to affect the hypoxic habitat and thus improve response to TH-302. At the end of this study, we will have developed a new set of MR imaging biomarkers for predicting and monitoring response in this heterogeneous group of diseases, with the expectation that these finding will inform a follow-on study in the clinic.

project	3R01CA196658-02S1	9453240	2017	A rapid spontaneous murine model of CN-AML	Grant	ABSTRACT\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is genetically complex, but patients can be divided into those with chromosomal\ntranslocations and those that are cytogenetically normal (CN-AML). CN-AML represents nearly 50% of human\nAML cases, and the overall 5-year survival for adults with CN-AML is approximately 30%. Mutations in the de\nnovo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and internal tandem duplications of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3\n(FLT3-ITD) and are two of the most frequent events in CN-AML. Moreover, recent whole-genome sequencing\nof CN-AML patient samples identified: 1) high-frequency co-occurrence of FLT3 and DNMT3A mutations, and\n2) corresponding changes to the risk classification for these CN-AML patients to a poorer prognosis. Because\nhuman epidemiologic studies cannot easily control for factors that confer disease risk, genetically engineered\nmouse (GEM) strains provide essential tractable platforms to mechanistically dissect disease pathobiology,\nheterogeneity and therapeutic response. Although neither Flt3-ITD nor inducible deletion of Dnmt3a induces\nspontaneous leukemia in mice, when we combined Flt3-ITD mutant alleles with inducible deletion of Dnmt3a\nwe find a spontaneous, rapidly lethal, completely-penetrant, and transplantable AML. We hypothesize that\ninducible deletion of Dnmt3a in Flt3-ITD mice produces a faithful model of human CN-AML that can be used to\ninfer essential biological and molecular factors that constitute therapeutic response. To this end, we propose,\ngenomic, cytogenetic, and single-cell molecular analyses (with comparison to primary human CN-AML) to\ndeconvolute both the tumor architecture and the underlying cellular states. We expect the proposed research\nto deliver a validated murine model of FLT3-ITD/DNMT3a-mutant CN-AML with defined translational utility.\n 	Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Address;Adult;Algorithms;Alleles;Animal Model;Architecture;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Markers;Biological Response Modifier Therapy;Bone Marrow;Catalytic Domain;Cells;Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure;Chromosomal translocation;Classification;Complex;Cytogenetics;DNA Modification Methylases;DNMT3a;Data;Data Set;Disease;Event;Exons;FLT3 gene;FLT3 inhibitor;Frequencies;Fusion Oncogene Proteins;Gene Expression;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic Markers;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Hematopoietic;Hematopoietic stem cells;Heterogeneity;Human;Ligands;MLL-AF9;Malignant Neoplasms;Metamyelocyte;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Molecular Target;Mouse Strains;Mus;Mutation;Myeloproliferative disease;Oncogenic;Oncoproteins;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Patients;Pattern;Penetrance;Population;Proteins;Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases;Relapse;Research;Residual Neoplasm;Resistance;Risk;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Somatic Mutation;Spectral Karyotyping;Stat5 protein;Testing;Therapeutic;Validation;Work;bisulfite sequencing;c-myc Genes;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;disorder risk;epidemiology study;exome sequencing;fetal liver kinase-2;genome sequencing;human genome sequencing;in vivo;leukemia;methylome;molecular pathology;mouse model;mutant;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;outcome forecast;programs;response;response biomarker;single cell analysis;standard of care;targeted treatment;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;treatment response;tumor;whole genome	CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR	CINCINNATI	OH	UNITED STATES	H.

project	3R01CA204396-02S1	9460673	2017	Aberrant signaling in acute myeloid leukemia	Grant	Project Summary\nDespite intense efforts, the long-term cure rates of children and adults with acute myeloid leukemia are not\nsatisfactory. Resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and apoptosis is the dominant cause of treatment failure.\nThe molecular mechanisms responsible for chemotherapy resistance are poorly understood, hindering the\ndevelopment of therapeutic strategies to induce chemosensitivity. We have found that chemotherapy and\napoptosis resistance in high-risk AML requires aberrant phosphorylation of MEF2C, a key transcriptional\nregulator of leukemia cell growth and survival. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that defining the\napoptotic mechanisms dysregulated by aberrant MEF2C signaling will reveal effective therapeutic strategies to\novercome treatment resistance. The applicant, who is a New Investigator, will test this hypothesis by\ninvestigating the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis resistance in primary human and genetically-engineered\nmouse leukemias. Aim 1 will elucidate both transcriptional and cellular mechanisms of therapy resistance, with\nthe goal of identifying MEF2C targets that are necessary and sufficient for chemoresistance. Aim 2 will pursue\nthe preliminary evidence that MARK family kinases aberrantly phosphorylate MEF2C and devise rational\ncombination strategies to overcome chemotherapy resistance induced by MEF2C phosphorylation. Successful\ncompletion of this project is expected to yield molecular mechanisms of aberrant survival and chemotherapy\nresistance of high-risk AML, thus providing essential insights into a fundamental biological and clinical problem,\nwhich can be rapidly translated into clinical trials for patients with this disease.	1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Adult;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Biological;Biological Markers;Cell Survival;Cells;Child;Chromatin;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Combination Drug Therapy;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;DNA Damage;Development;Disease;Epigenetic Process;FLT3 gene;Failure;Family;Gene Mutation;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3;Goals;Grant;Hematopoietic;Human;Immunodeficient Mouse;Knowledge;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mission;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Mutation;NR4A1 gene;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patient Care;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmacology;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Public Health;Recruitment Activity;Refractory;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resistance;SYK gene;Sampling;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specimen;Stem cell transplant;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Failure;United States National Institutes of Health;base;cancer cell;cell growth;chemotherapy;clinical care;clinically relevant;drug metabolism;high risk;improved;innovation;insight;jun Oncogene;leukemia;loss of function mutation;novel;response;therapeutic development;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;transcription factor;treatment strategy	SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Alex  Kentsis	DCTD	Suzanne L Forry	232133	232133	2017-08-28T04:00:00Z	2016-08-22T04:00:00Z	2021-07-31T04:00:00Z	PA-17-138	Moonshot
project	3R33CA192980-03S1	9515203	2017	Advanced development and validation of targeted molecular counting methods for precise and ultrasensitive quantitation of low prevalence somatic mutations	Grant	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultrasensitive detection of clinically relevant somatic alterations in cancer genomes has great potential for impacting patient care, e.g. for early detection, establishing diagnoses, refining prognoses, guiding treatment, and monitoring recurrence. However, current technologies are poorly suited to the robust detection of somatic mutations present at very low frequencies (<1%). Massively parallel sequencing represents an advantageous path forward, but its sensitivity to detect very rare events is fundamentally constrained by the sequencing error rate. We have recently developed a new experimental paradigm that overcomes this limitation. In our approach, each copy of a target sequence that is present in a sample is molecularly tagged during the first cycle of a multiplex capture reaction with a unique random sequence. After amplification, target amplicons and their corresponding molecular tags are subjected to massively parallel sequencing. During analysis, the molecular tags are used to associate sequence reads sharing a common origin. Through oversampling, reads bearing the same molecular tag error-correct one another to yield an independent haploid consensus for each progenitor molecule. Furthermore, the collapsing of commonly derived reads inherently corrects for any allele-specific bias during amplification, such that estimates of\nmutant allele frequency can be accompanied by precise confidence bounds ("molecular counting"). Among other benefits, the approach is sensitive to at least 1 mutated sequence in a background of 10,000 unmutated copies. Here we propose the advanced development and validation of this approach for use as a clinical diagnostic. In our first aim, we will develop a multiplexed panel to broadly target common cancer associated mutations using this technology. In our second aim, we will apply the panel to the detection of minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia as a prognostic marker of disease relapse. In our third aim, we will apply the panel to detection of ultra-rare mutations in circulating cell-free DNA, which is released into circulation from dying tumor cells, as a robust and non-invasive cancer diagnostic. The panel will be rigorously validated for clinical use in both aims, with performance metrics appropriately designed for the two separate analytes. The availability of robust, cost-effective, quantitative, and generically applicable tools for the ultrasensitive, multiplex detection of rare somatic events\nin the clinical setting will provide enhanced, transformative capabilities in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancers. The methodology will also have application to basic science cancer research.

project	3U24CA210999-02S1	9571405	2017	Global Infrastructure for Collaborative High-throughput  Cancer Genomics Analysis	Grant	Abstract\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) set the standards for large-scale cancer genome\nprojects worldwide. In the next phase, the National Cancer Institute and its Center for\nCancer Genomics are planning large-scale projects closely tied to clinical questions and\ntrials. In order to perform the analysis of these data, the NCI is creating a Genome Data\nAnalysis Network (GDAN) of different types of Genome Data Analysis Centers (GDACs).\nCentral to this Network is a single Processing GDAC, which will take all the harmonized\ndata, as stored in the NCI's Genomics Data Commons, and perform higher level integrated\nanalyses on these data to support both the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) within the\nNetwork (which will be formed for each project to perform special analyses of the data and\nwrite manuscripts) as well as the entire biomedical research community.\nHerein we propose to build the centralized Processing GDAC on top of our FireCloud\nplatform, an infrastructure to run large scale computation on the cloud in a fully rigorous\nand reproducible fashion. FireCloud development was based on our experience with\nFirehose, the Broad internal platform on which the standard TCGA data and analyses\ncurrently run. We propose to create and operate the GDAN Standard Workflow,\nincorporating tools actively developed and used within the GDAN and across the entire\nfield, with particular emphasis on clinical tools. This Workflow will serve as the starting\npoint for AWGs and set the highest standards of transparency, reproducibility and rigor for\ncancer genome analysis. The results of the Standard Workflow will be stored in a public\ndatabase, and accessible via standard APIs, and used together with a continuously\nupdated database of prior knowledge to create scientific reports that will be made available\nto the community, in a pre-publication manner. Finally, a major innovation is that AWG\nmembers will be able to login into FireCloud and rerun the entire workflow, or parts of it,\nwith their own parameters and subsets of the data – thus making the entire GDAN analysis\nfully reproducible and scalable.\nOur goals are therefore: (1) To create a global infrastructure for collaborative extreme-\nscale cancer analysis; (2) Operate the Standard Workflows at scale; (3) Rapidly and\ncontinuously evolve the Standard Workflows; and (4) created improved capabilities for\nreporting, exploring the results, clinical diagnostics and reproducibility.

project	1R01CA226983-01	9500837	2018	Directing the metabolic fate of CAR T cells	Grant	Project Summary / Abstract\nThe goal of this project is to develop the next generation of targeted T-cells with chimeric\nantigen receptors (CARs) for use in carcinomas and hematologic malignancies. Therefore,\nthese studies address the cancer epidemic that afflicts the population in the United States. CAR\nT cells are now beginning to show activity in a number of pilot clinical trials and they have\nsignificant potential for therapy of many cancers that are currently incurable. However two\nissues have emerged that provide a barrier to further rapid progress in the field: 1) the\npersistence of CAR T cells in patients with solid cancer has been limited, unlike the case with\nCARs that target CD19; 2) T cells become exhausted, become anergic or die in the toxic tumor\nmicroenvironment, unlike the case of hematologic malignancies, where CAR T cells have\ncontinued to function for at least 5 years in responding patients. Our preliminary data indicates\nthat the metabolic profiles of CAR T cells can be altered at will by changing the design of the\nsignaling domain in the CAR construct. In this project, we will use the principles of synthetic\nbiology and the tools of lentiviral vector technology, mRNA electroporation technology, and\nclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and CRISPR associated\nprotein 9 (Cas9) technology to adapt the metabolism of T cells in order to promote survival in\nharsh tumor microenvironments. The theme of the project is that T cells with more potent and\nsustained antitumor effects can be designed to resist metabolic checkpoints such as hypoxia,\nhyperkalemia, acidosis, and glucose deprivation. In summary, these overlapping studies will\ntest the central hypothesis that synthetically enhanced CAR T cells will improve CAR\nimmunotherapy compared to therapy with currently available CAR T cells. At the conclusion of\nthis project, a next generation of metabolically enhanced CAR T cells will be available for testing\nin pilot clinical trials in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

project	1R21CA217638-01A1	9501281	2018	Development, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Smoking Cessation Intervention Tailored to Rural Young Adult African American Men: Toward Scalability	Grant	Abstract\nDespite smoking fewer cigarettes daily, African American (AA) men suffer higher\nmorbidity and mortality associated with tobacco-related disorders than whites. Our\npreliminary data shows that 39.9% of AA men between 19 and 30 years of age who\nresided in rural Alabama smoke cigarettes. Although it has been well established that a\ncombination of pharmacotherapy and advice-oriented counseling and/or cognitive\nbehavioral interventions are efficacious in promoting smoking cessation across diverse\npopulations, these evidence-based treatments for tobacco dependence have not proven\nto be effective/efficacious (or even accessible) among some subpopulations suffering\ndisproportionally from tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. The overall goal of this\nfeasibility study is to make adaptations to these evidence-based approaches, and\ndevelop, implement, and examine the feasibility and scalability of a theory-based,\nculturally relevant smoking cessation intervention for young adult AA men in rural\nAlabama who smoke cigarettes. Our formative assessments point to a cognitive-\nbehavioral intervention delivered by a trained Community Health Worker with the support\nfrom an “expert” physician who can deliver the pharmacological component via Skype\nthrough an integrated approach. The proposed study will address the next three steps in\nthis process: development of the intervention, pretesting, and feasibility. First, we will\ndevelop the intervention with input from a Community Advisory Committee, followed by\nan iterative process by which the target audience will be exposed to materials and\nmessages to provide feedback (pretesting). Once all intervention components are\nfinalized, we will recruit participants, randomly assign them to intervention/control\ngroups, pilot test, and evaluate the intervention. The comparison group will be the\nAlabama Tobacco Quitline with 8 weeks of Nicotine Replacement Therapy to be\nconsistent with the pharmacological approach proposed for the intervention. The primary\noutcome will be 7-day point prevalence abstinence (defined as no cigarettes in the past\n7 days and verified through measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide levels) at 6-\nmonth follow-up. We will also conduct detailed treatment fidelity and scalability\nassessments (acceptability, feasibility, potential reach and adoption, alignment with the\nstrategic context) to inform a full-scale efficacy trial.

project	1U01AA027681-01	9626297	2018	Immunosuppressive mechanisms responsible for development of non-viral liver cancer and control of its response to immune checkpoint inhibitors	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nThis project will explore adaptive immune mechanisms that control development of hepatocellular carcinoma\n(HCC), a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and dictate its responsiveness to PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint\ninhibitors. Our team, including Michael Karin, Ph.D. and Shabnam Shalapour, Ph.D. at UCSD School of Medicine\nand Hidekazu Tsukamoto, D.V.M., Ph.D. and Anthony El-Khoueiry, M.D. at USC Keck School of Medicine,\nrepresents an ideal blend of basic researchers, translational scientists and oncologists who are interested in\nHCC molecular pathogenesis and treatment, especially in HCC caused by non-alcoholic (NASH) and alcoholic\n(ASH) steatohepatitis. Although the US incidence of HCC and its associated mortality have nearly tripled in the\npast generation, insufficient effort has been made toward identification and development of innovative and\neffective HCC therapies. However, the ideal and timely confluence of basic preclinical research and applied\nclinical studies carried out by our team members has the potential to critically transform HCC treatment forever.\nTogether we found that chronic liver inflammation results in suppression of HCC-protective immunosurveillance\nto support rapid malignant progression. This unique immunopathogenic mechanism renders HCC responsive to\ndrugs that disrupt the PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint, but even the impressive response seen thus far and the selection\nof patients who will benefit from this therapeutic approach can be further improved. Such improvements can only\nbe achieved by a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitors act, the factors\nthat determine their efficacy, and the causes of treatment failure. We will achieve these goals through integrated\nstudies of clinical specimens collected by Dr. El-Khoueiry and sophisticated, faithful and robust mouse models\nof non-viral HCC developed by Drs. Tsukamoto, Shalapour, and Karin. The immune mechanisms that control\nNASH- and ASH-driven HCC development in these models are highly similar to those that operate in human\npatients. Using this integrated approach, we will pursue five specific aims: 1) determine whether serum IgA\nconcentrations correlate with therapeutic response to PD-1 blockade in patients with non-viral HCC; 2) develop\nreliable mouse models of ASH-driven HCC; 3) compare the immunosuppressive mechanisms that contribute to\ndevelopment of NASH- and ASH-driven HCC and control their response to PD-L1 blockade; 4) determine\nwhether excessive peritumoral fibrosis correlates with diminished response to PD-1 blockade in HCC patients;\nand 5) determine whether agents that inhibit or attenuate stellate cell activation potentiate the response to PD-\n1/PD-L1 blockade in non-viral HCC. The successful completion of these studies will result in substantial\nimprovements to HCC immunotherapy and will establish reliable procedures for identification of patients who are\nmost likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 targeting drugs, advances that will result in significant cost savings which\nmay amount to hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

project	1U01CA232486-01	9616405	2018	Multispecific targeting incorporating cytokine receptor pathways in high risk pediatric acute leukemias to improve durability of adoptive cell therapy-induced remissions	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe primary hypothesis of this proposal is that co-targeting of already-validated leukemia surface antigens and\nessential cytokine receptor pathways in genetic subtypes of high-risk pediatric ALL and AML will reduce the\nemergence of treatment resistance and leukemia relapse following remissions induced by cellular\nimmunotherapy. These studies have broad relevance for pediatric leukemias given dependencies of numerous\nAML and ALL subtypes upon critical oncogenic cytokine receptor signaling pathways and the demonstrated\nclinical efficacy of cellular immunotherapies in children with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. In this proposal, we aim\nto develop combinatorial CAR approaches targeting (1) the TSLP receptor plus CD19 and/or CD22 to improve\nremission induction and longevity in Ph-like B-ALL, (2) the FLT3 receptor plus CD19 and/or CD22 to improve\nremission induction and longevity in KMT2A-rearranged B-ALL, and (3) the FLT3 receptor and CD33 to\nimprove remission induction and longevity in FLT3-mutant AML. The overall goal of these studies is to identify\nsuccessful combinatorial immunotherapeutic approaches to mitigate now-known resistance mechanisms of\nkinase signaling and antigen escape that are imminently translatable to the clinic for early-phase testing in\nchildren with high-risk acute leukemias.

project	1U01CA232488-01	9616475	2018	Metabolic reprogramming of tumor microenvironment to maximize immunotherapy for pediatric cancers	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nInteractions of the immune system with tumors are complex and dynamic processes, which dictate tumor initia-\ntion, progression, and responses to therapy. Mounting evidence has shown that immunotherapies through\nstrengthening the amplitude and quality of T cell-mediated adaptive response may mediate durable and even\ncomplete tumor regression in some cancer patients. Two of the most promising approaches to enhance thera-\npeutic anti-tumor immunity are immune checkpoint blockade using monoclonal antibodies against PD-1/PD-L1\nand CTLA-4, and adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) or peripheral T cells that\nare genetically engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). However, functional and effective effector\nT cells require metabolically rewiring T cells to meet their anabolic and energy demands. A critical barrier for\nimmunotherapy is the hostile metabolic microenvironment within solid tumors, where the highly metabolic-\ndemanding tumor cells compromise the function of T cells by competing for glucose. In addition, tumor cells\nalso release immune suppressive metabolite, adenosine into the extracellular space. While recent advances\nhave helped determine the metabolic reprogramming of T cell activation and its regulatory signaling mecha-\nnism, the detailed landscape of metabolic programs in active T cells and the impact of the tumor’s metabolic\nmicroenvironment on the development and anti-tumor immune function of cytotoxic T effector (Teff) cells re-\nmains elusive. Our studies have shown that glucose restriction significantly dampened the growth and tumor-\nkilling activities of Teff cells. We further identified inosine as a potent metabolite that could replace glucose in\npromoting Teff cells growth and tumor-killing activities. Using inosine as the alterative metabolic substrate indi-\ncates a layer of metabolic plasticity on T cells and further implicates the potential of inosine in relieving tumor-\nimposed metabolic restrictions on T cells in vivo. However, stressed or damaged tumor cells release adeno-\nsine, an immediate metabolic precursor of inosine into the extracellular space to suppress Teff cells, shaping\nthe efficacy and magnitude of anti-tumor immune response. Hence, we hypothesize that reprogramming of\nthe adenosine-inosine metabolic axis can maximize anti-tumor immune response in treating pediatric\nsolid tumors. To test our hypothesis, we propose to 1) decipher inosine catabolic pathways and to assess the\nimpact of key metabolic steps on Teff cells; 2) develop and test inosine modulation strategies to enhance im-\nmunotherapy; and 3) develop strategies to reprogram tumor metabolic microenvironment and maximize sys-\ntemic anti-tumor immunity We propose taking the first step in testing the metabolic modulation of Teff cells to\nrelieve the metabolic barriers imposed by the tumor’s microenvironment. Our studies will have profound effects\non the field of cancer immunotherapy and substantially improve clinical outcomes of pediatric cancer patients.\nThe insights generated from this study will reveal fundamental principles of the emerging connections between\nthe tumor’s microenvironment, cell metabolism, and anti-tumor immunity.

project	1U01CA232490-01	9616501	2018	Combinations of Synergistic Bispecific Human Antibodies: A Novel Strategy for the Treatment of Neuroblastoma	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nA solid Consortium project should contribute a unique and compelling approach to neuroblastoma\nand supply tools or components that enable other members of the Consortium to make their best\nwork even better. The project detailed here commences with the selection and careful\ncharacterization of a dozen fully human antibodies to Glypican-2, the most promising antigen in\nneuroblastoma, from a pre-existing hybridoma stock. These antibodies, along with their full\nsequences, binding affinities, cellular internalization, epitope, and (where possible) crystal structures,\nwill be made available to Consortium members within the first year for use in their modality of choice.\nThis project will explore their utility as components in double bispecific antibody therapy: this double\nbispecific approach targets two cancer antigens and two T cell receptors simultaneously, inducing T\ncell activation and co-activation only in the presence of cancer cells expressing both antigens. The\ndouble targeting strategy should allow for a much higher level of selective engagement and killing\nthan has heretofore been possible with therapies that target only a single cancer antigen, and should\nit prove effective in neuroblastoma the approach is likely to have utility in a wide variety of cancers.\nOne historical weakness for the development of immuno-oncology approaches such as this one is\nthat the animal models have had very little predictive value. For this reason, the best of the\nhumanized mouse models, “MISTRG” mice, will be used both for the development of these molecules\nand for testing the other consortium members’ approaches, where they could be useful. CIVO multi-\nneedle array technology will be employed to simplify the combinatorial challenge associated with\ntesting pairs of bispecific molecules; this technology will also be open for use collaboratively with the\nother Consortium members. In short, the proposal provides the Consortium with human antibodies\nagainst a validated neuroblastoma target, access to the current state-of-the-art in humanized mice, a\nCIVO multi-needle array device to facilitate testing therapeutics, and a double bispecific antibody\ntherapeutic approach that promises a high level of T cell killing and selectivity and a likely broad\napplicability beyond neuroblastoma.

project	1U01CA232491-01	9616585	2018	Dual targeting of tumoral microenvironment and tumoral cells by blocking the IL-33/ST2 pathway	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: A fundamental gap exists in our knowledge of the immunologic tumoral\nmicroenvironment during the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other deadly childhood\ncancers. Bridging of this gap could lead to novel immunotherapies. Our long-term goals are to develop novel\nimmunotherapies for leukemia and pediatric solid tumors. Our objective in this application is to investigate the\nrole of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing Stimulation-2 (ST2), the IL-33 receptor in the\nmicroenvironment as well as ST2 on tumoral cells. Our central hypothesis is that we can target the tumoral\nmicroenvironment and tumoral cells by blocking the IL-33/ST2 pathway with neutralizing and bispecific\nantibodies that we will develop. This hypothesis was formed based on our unpublished preliminary data\nshowing that: First, nonmalignant mice deficient in T-bet have elevated numbers of BM-infiltrating ST2+ Tregs\ncompared to wild-type (WT) mice (45% vs 25%, respectively), suggesting reciprocal roles of ST2/IL33 and T-\nbet/interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in Tregs from the BM niche. Second, we observed 10-fold more Tregs expressing\nsignificantly more activation markers in the BM niche of AML-bearing mice than in the nonmalignant niche.\nThird, MLL-AF9 AML cell proliferation was significantly lower in mice receiving donor syngeneic ST2 knock-out\n(ST2-/-) T cells than in mice receiving donor syngeneic WT T cells (2% vs 17%, respectively). ST2 blockade\nalso decreased Treg activation (i.e., KLRG1) and increased type 1 signaling in CD8+ T cells as well as\ndecreased their exhaustion, suggesting restoration of an antitumoral response in ST2-/- mice. The rationale for\nthis study is that once we are able to understand the biology of the immunological microenvironment in the\nmalignant niche, we can propose personalized treatment plans to block the tolerogenic pathways. Similarly,\nunderstanding the biology responsible for the overexpression of ST2/IL-33 on the tumoral cell, will help target\nthis pathway. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Explore ST2 and IL-33 expression on\ntumoral cells and in the tumoral microenvironment from liquid and solid childhood cancers in human and mice;\n2) Examine whether ST2/IL-33 blockade can impact tumor immunity in the malignant BM niche and solid tumor\nmicroenvironment as a proof-of-principle of a novel antitumoral immunotherapy; and 3) Optimizing anti-ST2\nneutralizing antibodies against murine and human targets for translational purpose. This approach is innovative\nbecause, to our knowledge, the function of ST2+ Tregs in the malignant microenvironment, remains virtually\nunexplored. It will also provide biological insights into the nature of ST2+ Tregs and ST2+ tumoral cells in the\nmicroenvironment and determine whether their blockade can restore antitumoral activity and decrease tumoral\nproliferation via a dual mechanism. The proposed research is significant because novel antitumoral\nimmunotherapies that are more targeted and less toxic than classical chemotherapy/irradiation regimens are\nneeded.

project	1U01CA232563-01	9617084	2018	Cassette exons in neoplastic pro-B-cells: implications for immunotherapy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nSuccessful immunotherapies for childhood cancers typically target lineage-, rather than cancer-specific\nmarkers, B-cell specific CD19 being the prime example. These successes culminated in the recent FDA\napproval of bi-specific T-cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-armed T-cells for B-cell acute\nlymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, relapses frequently occur in patients treated with CD19-\ndirected immunotherapies, often due to epitope loss. While strategies based on dual antigen targeting are\nbeginning to emerge, they are still based on targeting canonical B-cell markers, with the unavoidable side\neffect of total ablation of normal B-cells. The apparent paucity of tumor-specific targets in pediatric cancers\n(including leukemias) is likely to limit future immunotherapies. We hypothesize that alternative splicing\ncould be both a mechanism of epitope loss and a rich source of a neo-antigens in B-ALL. Indeed, using\ncomputational and biochemical approaches, we have identified hundreds of local splicing variations\n(LSVs), mapping to transmembrane proteins (e.g., CD19 and CD22) with prominent extracellular domains\n(ectodomains). In fact, in our prior work we described a mechanism of acquired resistance to CART-19\nbased on selective loss of the CD19 ectodomain, primarily through exon 2 skipping. The two large Aims of\nthis U01 are as follows. Aim 1: To identify programs and determinants of altered splicing of B-ALL cell\nsurface antigens. Our overarching goal is to construct a dedicated “splicing code” for leukemic B-cells. Such\na code will predict cis-acting genetic variants as well as trans-acting factors involved in alternative splicing\nand allow us to identify all alternatively spliced ectodomains. Then in Aim 2, we will investigate the effects\nof alternative splicing on B-ALL immunotherapy. Using CD22 as just one example, we will determine how\ntruncated protein isoforms confer resistance to CD22-targeting immunotherapeutics, including antibody-\ndrug conjugates such as inotuzumab ozogamicin, which was recently approved by FDA to treat relapsed or\nrefractory B-ALL. We will also raise antibodies against peptides spanning novel exon junctions, generate\nantibody-drug conjugates, and test their efficacy against B-ALL cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In\nsummary, this leukemia-based U01 will create new computational and conceptual frameworks, which\nwould be highly synergistic with Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery & Development Network (PI-DDN)\noverall goals, including identification of antigenic epitopes that are uniquely expressed on childhood\ncancers and of cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms of immune evasion.

project	1U01CA232758-01	9618288	2018	B cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity in ovarian cancer	Grant	ABSTRACT\n Within tumor beds, T and B cells often interact to form highly organized structures similar to\nlymph nodes, termed tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), which are associated with better\noutcomes in many tumors. TFH cells are crucial for the formation of germinal centers and\nhumoral responses, and our new data show that TFH cells become the main producers of\nCXCL13 and TNFS14/LIGHT upon vaccination. The assembly and maintenance of TLS should\nbe therefore dependent on TFH responses. Our new data demonstrate that Special AT-rich\nsequence-binding protein-1 (Satb1) ablation specifically in T cells leads to enhanced TFH\ndifferentiation and augmented Ag-specific humoral responses, which is associated with\nconcurrent ICOS and PD-1 de-repression. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that\nLIGHT+CXCL13+ TFH cell formation and, subsequently, the orchestration of TLS in cancer, is\ngoverned by Satb1 silencing in CD4 T cells by both de-repressing ICOS in TFH cells and\nsuppressing Foxp3+PD-1highCXCR5+ T follicular regulatory (TFR) cell formation through PD-1\nup-regulation. Therefore, TGF-β paradoxically enhances the generation of TFH cells and the\nformation of TLS through Satb1 repression.\n In Aim 1, we will define the role of SATB1-dependent ICOS expression during TFH\ndifferentiation. Through ChIP-PCR and functional analysis of Satb1-competent vs. Satb1-\ndeficient T cells in vivo, we will substantiate a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby the master\ngenomic organizer Satb1 governs ICOS expression, leading to enhanced TFH differentiation in\nthe absence of Satb1.\n In Aim 2, we will determine the role of SATB1 in TGF-β-driven, Treg-dependent TFH\ndifferentiation. Here, we will combine geentic manipulation and existing transgenic models to\nestablish to what extent the mechanism of TGF-β-driven TFH differentiation is Satb1- and PD-1-\ndependent, in a manner that requires decreased TFR formation.\n In Aim 3, we will recapitulate the mechanisms leading to the formation and protective activity\nof TLS in vivo in ovarian cancer. By leveraging unique transgenic models, our ovarian cancer-\nspecific CAR T cells and our viable single-cell suspensions from freshly dissociated ovarian\ncarcinomas, we will define a novel TGF-β → Satb1 silencing → TFH cell formation axis driving\nrelevant anti-tumor humoral responses.\n Our work will exert a profound effect in the field by elucidating how epigenetic programs\ncontrolled by SATB1 govern the generation of TFH cells at tumor beds in a TGF-β-dependent\nmanner. Recapitulating these mechanisms in vivo will pave the way for more effective\nimmunotherapies aimed to promote combined humoral and T cell responses through the\norchestration of TLS in irresectable/metastatic tumors, and could lead to the identification of\nantibodies with anti-tumor activity spontaneously produced at tumor beds.

project	1U01CA232826-01	9624190	2018	Leveraging an electronic medical record infrastructure to identify primary care patients eligible for genetic testing for hereditary cancer and evaluate novel cancer genetics service delivery models	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nIdentifying individuals with inherited cancer susceptibility is critical for targeted cancer prevention, screening,\nand treatment. Strategies to assess the genetic risk of unaffected individuals are needed. Scalable and\nsustainable methods to automatically extract and analyze family history information routinely captured in the\nelectronic health record (EHR) can identify primary care patients appropriate for cancer genetic services.\nIncreased patient ascertainment needs to be paired with implementation studies to compare models of\ndelivering genetic services, including patient-directed models. Because access to services continues to be a\nbarrier for those from minority racial and ethnic groups and rural areas, examining responses to different\ndelivery models across population subgroups is essential. This study will employ an implementation science\nframework to test a replicable EHR-based clinical decision support (CDS) infrastructure to: (i) automatically\nidentify unaffected patients from 48 primary care clinics in two healthcare systems, University of Utah and New\nYork University, who qualify for cancer genetic services (Aim 1); and (ii) compare two models of genetic\nservices delivery for 1,920 primary care patients using a randomized trial design with clinic-level randomization\n(Aims 2 and 3). We hypothesize that the CDS infrastructure will identify additional patients who have not been\npreviously referred (Aim 1) and that uptake of genetic testing (Aim 2) and adherence to management\nrecommendations (Aim 3) will be equivalent between the models. To address Aim 1, we will evaluate whether\nthe CDS approach identifies patients who have not previously been referred, and whether this varies by\nrace/ethnicity and rurality. To address Aim 2, we will compare: a patient-directed model in which those\nidentified by the CDS infrastructure as meeting testing criteria will be informed of their cancer risks, provided\nwith educational resources, and offered the option to select genetic testing through a patient portal to an\nenhanced standard of care model in which providers and patients are notified through CDS when criteria are\nmet and of the availability of standard of care genetic counseling. We will compare uptake of genetic testing by\nmodel and whether this differs by race/ethnicity and rurality. In Aim 3, we will compare the effects of the two\ndelivery models on adherence to recommendations 12 months after return of results, examining differences in\neffects by race/ethnicity and rurality. Innovative features include implementation of population-based CDS\nassessment of family history information available in the EHR; comparison of outcomes of patient-directed and\nenhanced standard of care delivery models; and focus on impact of race/ethnicity and rurality. This highly\nimpactful translational research builds on our unique strengths in cancer genetics, clinical informatics, and\npopulation sciences, and addresses issues of immediate clinical significance, including increasing hereditary\ncancer genetic testing in appropriate patients and improving access for underserved groups.

project	1U01CA232859-01	9624707	2018	Advancing Analysis and Interpretation ofAdverse Events and PROs in Cancer Clinical Trials	Grant	In this application and program of research, we will collaborate with the NRG Oncology Statistical Center to\ndevelop analytic strategies to investigate novel methods for assessing treatment tolerability, as well as to model\nnew approaches for data presentation using data from randomized NSABP trials that contain both Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) data and high quality patient reported outcomes (PRO) data.\nSubsequently, we will apply these new analytic approaches and other methods to NRG Oncology phase III\nclinical trials that include PRO-CTCAE items to assess treatment toxicity associated with immunotherapy.\nInclusion of PRO-CTCAE items in this newest generation of immunotherapy trials is particularly important, as\nthere are limited PRO data from early phase immunotherapy studies, and tolerability may be a critical issue for\npatients in the adjuvant therapy or early metastatic disease settings that are the patient populations in these\ntrials. We previously developed a summary measure, the toxicity index (TI), to discriminate patients based on\ntheir overall toxicity experiences. Toxicity data are summarized for each subject from graded AE according to\nCTCAE. TI accounts for all observed toxicity grades rather than only the most severe one, as is conventionally\ndone. Because of its sensitivity to differences in the overall toxicity, the TI is likely to be useful also for identifying\npredictors of treatment-related toxicity. In addition to the other novel methods described herein, we will employ\nthe TI and extensions or refinements of it to support new and improved methods for PRO and related adverse\nevent data. The problems addressed in this RFA are very amenable to partial solution by the TI approach. We\nalso propose to modify it in collaboration with oncologists, PRO experts and patient advocates to address the\nduration and frequency of AEs, and other special needs of PRO-CTCAE data. While we will focus much effort\non developing new technical statistical methods, we will work as a team of PRO experts, oncologists, data\nscientists, and clinical trial experts to keep the developments grounded in patient-centric and clinical trial relevant\nperspectives. The specific aims of this application are: Aim 1: To apply and extend TI and other methods to\ndescribe toxicity and develop models to determine risk factors for AEs. (a) Develop new graphical methods to\ndescribe toxicity; (b) Develop new longitudinal models accounting for missing data to determine risk factors for\nAEs; (c) Compare our new methods with existing approaches such as max-grade/max-time, TAME, and ToxT;\n(d) Refine, extend, and apply the TI to PRO-CTCAE to model CTCAE data. Aim 2: To develop predictive models\nfor limiting dose toxicity, treatment completion, and efficacy based on individual patient characteristics and\ntoxicity profiles defined by TI and PRO-TI. (a) Develop predictive models for completion and efficacy as time to\nevent outcomes; (b) Develop predictive models for optimal dose using various definitions of tolerability based on\nCTCAE and PRO-CTCAE; (c) Develop and disseminate web applications to implement the methods developed;\n(d) Use multi-disciplinary experts and patient advocates to review and guide the methods developed.

project	1U01CA233046-01	9626225	2018	Analyzing and Interpreting PRO-CTCAE with CTCAE and Other Clinical Data to Characterize Drug Tolerability	Grant	PROJECT ABSTRACT\nIn cancer clinical trials, it is essential to understand and communicate the negative impact of drugs on patient\nparticipants in order to balance risks and benefits. Symptom side effects such as nausea and diarrhea are\nparticularly common and impactful on the patient experience. However, historically this information has been\nreported by clinicians on behalf of their patients rather than by patients themselves – a process that has been\nshown to miss up to half of patients' symptoms. Therefore, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) supported\ndevelopment of the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse\nEvents (PRO-CTCAE), a library of questions to enable systematic patient self-reporting of side effect\ninformation. To date, the PRO-CTCAE questions have been developed and tested for validity and feasibility of\nuse in clinical trials – work that was led by the investigators on this proposal under contracts to the NCI.\nHowever, it is not yet established how best to combine PRO-CTCAE information with traditional measures of\ntreatment impact such as clinician-reported adverse events, time on treatment, drug dose levels, performance\nstatus, and hospitalizations. The purpose of this proposal is to advance understanding of the role of the PRO-\nCTCAE in combination with these traditional measures of treatment impact in assessments of drug tolerability.\nIn this proposal, advanced statistical methods will be used to analyze data from numerous clinical trials\naccessible to the team through the National Clinical Trial Network (cooperative groups) and industry. The\nspecific aims are to: 1) characterize relationships between the PRO-CTCAE and traditional measures of\ntreatment impact and tolerability; 2) test and standardize analytic techniques for the PRO-CTCAE; 3) refine\napproaches to analyzing missing PRO-CTCAE data; and 4) develop and refine tabular and graphical data\nvisualizations for longitudinal PRO-CTCAE data. To accomplish these aims, an exceptional multidisciplinary\nteam has been assembled including scientific, clinical, and patient investigators with extensive experience in\nacademic and industry clinical research, and longstanding expertise in patient-reported outcomes, adverse\nevents, biostatistics, psychometrics, clinical trial design/analysis, health disparities, and informatics. This team\nhas successfully led multiple prior national research consortia. The team will work collaboratively and flexibly\nwith other investigators and stakeholders through the planned U01 consortium, and will share data, statistical\nprogramming code, and ideas freely. This work is intended to inform best practices for tabulating and reporting\nPRO-CTCAE data, and will enable more systematic and patient-centered evaluations of tolerability in cancer\nclinical trials.

project	1U01CA233056-01	9626226	2018	Neoantigen Vaccination for Lynch Syndrome Immunoprevention	Grant	Lynch syndrome (LS) is a genetic disease predisposing to colorectal cancer (CRC) that affects more than one\nmillion Americans. Germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, primarily MLH1 and MSH2,\ncause deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) and LS. LS CRCs have exceptionally high numbers of small\ninsertion/deletion frameshift and missense mutations. Elevated dMMR mutation rates cause some mutations to\nrecurrently arise in tumors from different patients. For example, the human TGFβR2 gene has a poly(A) coding\nrepeat, and the same “shared” frameshift mutation is recurrently identified in >60% of LS dMMR CRCs. Here,\nwe will use state of the art tools to systematically delineate recurrent LS mouse and human pre-malignant\nneoantigens, test whether vaccination with frequently mutated “shared” immunogenic neoantigens reduces LS\nmouse CRC penetrance, and elucidate adaptive immune mechanisms for CRC immunoprevention. In Aim 1\nwe will comprehensively delineate frequently mutated recurrent neoantigens in Lynch syndrome mouse\ncolorectal mucosa and adenomas. This will provide insights into pre-malignant colon dMMR immunoediting\nmechanisms, the timing and sequence of dMMR neoantigen appearance, and systematically delineate the\nmost immunogenic recurrent shared dMMR neoantigen vaccine targets for LS mouse CRC immunoprevention.\nIn Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome\nmismatch repair deficient epithelial cells in colon mucosa. This will give insights into the mechanism of dMMR\ncolon mucosal immunoediting, and test the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent neoantigen vaccine\nstrategy using the earliest neoantigen mutations for LS immunoprevention. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis\nthat recurrent neoantigen vaccination reduces mouse Lynch syndrome colorectal tumor burden. This will\nevaluate the efficacy and safety of a dMMR recurrent adenoma neoantigen vaccine strategy for Lynch\nsyndrome immunoprevention and provide insights into the mechanisms of dMMR immunoediting. Finally, in\nAim 4 we will systematically delineate Lynch syndrome patient adenoma recurrent neoantigens. This will\ndelineate the most promising candidate recurrent neoantigens that can be used for LS patient tumor vaccine\nclinical trials and give insights into dMMR immunoediting mechanisms. Our overall goal is to develop effective,\nsafe mechanism based neoantigen vaccination strategies for Lynch syndrome CRC immunoprevention.

project	1U01CA233074-01	9626083	2018	Targeting alternative splicing for TCR discovery in small cell carcinomas	Grant	ABSTRACT\n We present a collaborative immunotherapeutics discovery program that exploits alternative pre-mRNA\nsplicing as a source of cancer-specific epitopes for T-cell receptor (TCR) therapy of small cell carcinomas of\nthe prostate and lung. Small cell carcinomas arise from many different epithelial tissues but are generally\naggressive, have no curative treatment, and carry a dire prognosis. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most\ncommon subtype. Small cell prostate cancer (SCPC) is rare as a primary disease but is becoming increasingly\ncommon as a late-stage phenotypic transition in response to hormone-deprivation therapy. Emerging research\nindicates that despite their disparate tissues of origin, SCPC and SCLC are highly similar in behavior and\nmolecular phenotype. This suggests effective targeted therapies could address both malignancies.\n Our strategy is to define cancer-specific epitopes created by alternative pre-mRNA splicing in small cell\ncarcinomas and then use these targets to develop TCR-based therapeutics. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell\n(CAR-T) therapies targeting cell surface proteins have been developed for some hematological malignancies,\nbut this strategy has been unsuccessful for epithelial tumors. The limited cancer specificity of the target epitope\nhas led to significant on-target, off-tumor toxicities in human trials. We have chosen to pursue TCRs to expand\nthe pool of available targets beyond the cell surface. We hypothesize that tapping into the additional proteomic\ndiversity revealed by a detailed analysis of alternatively spliced exons will provide better targets.\n Our team of principal investigators includes experts in the computational biology of alternative splicing\n(Yi Xing), cancer cell biology and immunology (Owen Witte), and hematopoietic cell development and\nimmunology (Gay Crooks). We are compiling RNA-Seq data on small cell cancers and normal tissues from\npublic datasets and new human cell line models of SCPC & SCLC derived from benign cells by lentiviral\ntransduction. This combined dataset serves as the foundation for our discovery effort. We plan to pair this with\ntotal proteomics analysis to identify spliced isoforms that affect protein composition. This data will be further\nintegrated with immunopeptidomics assays that define the pool of peptides presented to the immune system\nby the target cancer cells. Epitopes derived from alternative splicing events that show high cancer specificity,\nprotein expression, and predicted or observed epitope presentation will be prioritized for TCR development.\nWe will use these epitopes to select TCRs from naïve human T-cell populations using a highly organotypic in\nvitro artificial human thymic culture system developed in the Crooks laboratory.

project	1U01CA233078-01	9626046	2018	N-glycosylation and Immunotherapy for cancer	Grant	Project Summary\nFor decades, the treatment of cancer has relied on surgical resection, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.\nRecently, a number of immune based therapies have provided promising new approaches for cancer treatment.\nThese include checkpoint inhibitors that block T cell suppression (eg anti-PD-1), bi-specific antibodies that\ncross-link T cells to cancer cells (eg Bi-specific T cell engagers – BiTE) and T cells engineered to express\nantigen receptors specific to cancer cells (eg Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells or CAR T). All three\napproaches induce T cell mediated killing of cancer cells. However, widespread development of bi-specific\nantibodies and CAR T cells is limited by the small number of known cell-surface proteins that are sufficiently\nspecific to cancer to safely allow targeting by antibodies. This is particularly true for solid cancers, where unlike\nhematopoietic malignancies, loss of healthy cells cannot be readily replenished by stem cell progenitors. A\nsolution to this issue is to target cancer specific glycan antigens rather than protein antigens. Indeed, altered\nglycosylation is a near universal feature of cancer and represent the most abundant and widely expressed cell\nsurface cancer antigens, while also having limited or no expression in normal tissue. However, generation of\nmonoclonal antibodies specific to complex carbohydrates has proven to be very challenging, greatly limiting\ntheir usefulness as targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we propose to address these issues and\ndevelop a novel class of immunotherapeutics that target an N-linked carbohydrate antigen common to\nthe vast majority of solid and hematopoietic cancers. We have termed these molecules as Glycan-\ndependent T cell Recruiter (GlyTR) technology. Critically, GlyTR technology does not utilize antibodies to\ntarget carbohydrate cancer antigens. Preliminary data demonstrates that the GlyTR bi-specific protein 1)\nspecifically bound to both human CD3 and its N-glycan target, 2) robustly activated T cells only in the presence\nof cancer cells, 3) induced T cell dependent killing of cancer cells with an EC50 as low as 5pM, 4) inhibited in\nvivo growth of established colon cancer xenografts in humanized NSG mice and 5) did not trigger production of\nantibodies in mice. To further expand on this approach, the following Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will\ncharacterize human and mouse reactive GlyTR bi-specific proteins targeting N-glycans. Aim 2 will\nexamine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using humanized NSG mice.\nAim 3 will examine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using mice with a\nnormal immune system. If successful, these experiments will provide proof of principal data for an entire new\nclass of cancer killing immunotherapeutic's capable of targeting multiple solid and hematopoietic cancers with\nminimal toxicity.

project	1U01CA233084-01	9626008	2018	MUC1-C is a Target for Reversing Immune Evasion and Resistance to Immunotherapies	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\n Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint has advanced the treatment of patients with diverse types\nof solid tumors. However, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been limited by low response rates and limited durations\nof response in certain settings, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer\n(TNBC), as well as ovarian, prostate and colorectal cancers. These findings are explained, at least in part, by\nthe premise that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is only one of a number of tumor immune suppressive mechanisms that\nrequire inhibition.\n Therefore, additional strategies are clearly needed to improve the immunotherapy of human cancers. In\nthis respect, cancer cells activate a program of immune evasion involving, for example, induction of PD-L1\nexpression and the downregulation of effectors that promote innate and adaptive immune response. The\ndiscovery and targeting of such immune suppressive programs has had limited success to date, supporting a\ncritical need for identifying signaling pathways that activate these programs.\n The MUC1-C oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in human carcinomas and is associated with poor\nclinical outcomes. MUC1-C promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the cancer stem cell\n(CSC) state. Recent advances have demonstrated that MUC1-C also activates a program of immune evasion\nin human cancer cells that includes upregulation of PD-L1 expression and the suppression of immune\neffectors, such as IFN. In addition, targeting MUC1-C has been found to effectively reverse tumor immune\nevasion.\n These findings have emphasized the need for developing agents that target MUC1-C for the\nimmunotherapy of human cancers. In this way, selective and potent antibodies generated against the MUC1-C\nextracellular domain are under development as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and for antibody-\ndependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, a peptide inhibitor of the MUC1-C cytoplasmic\ndomain has been developed in a nanoparticle formulation, based on the findings that this agent inhibits PD-L1\nexpression and activates anti-tumor T cells in the immune microenvironment.\n The MUC1-C-targeted agents will be studied in genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for\nanti-tumor activity, as well as effects on the immune microenvironment when used alone and in combination\nwith PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade. These studies will be integrated with assessment of MUC1-C expression in\nhuman tumors as a metric of the suppressive immune microenvironment. The overall goal will be to develop\nagents that target MUC1-C and are advanced to clinical evaluation as novel immunotherapeutics.

project	1U01CA233097-01	9625934	2018	Epithelium-derived alarmins role in breast cancer immunoprevention	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract:\nAdvances in cancer immunology has led to the successful use of patients' own immune cells to combat\nmetastatic cancers. However, the therapeutic potential of the immune system in eliminating premalignant cells\nand preventing their progression to invasive cancers is unclear. To determine the benefit of activating the\nimmune system to prevent cancer development and recurrence, we study the immune pathways that lead to\neffective immune activation against early phases of breast cancer development. Breast cancer is the most\ncommon internal cancer and second cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Importantly,\nthe individuals at high risk of developing breast cancer due to underlying genetic mutations and those with\npremalignant lesions can be clinically identified and treated. Therefore, discovering an effective approach to\nactivate the patients' own immune system against early breast precursor lesions may yield a lasting memory\nthat can prevent breast cancer development and recurrence in this high-risk population. Our previous studies\nhave demonstrated that a skin-derived immune factor called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) suppresses\nthe early stages of skin and breast cancer development. We have been able to extend these finding to clinics\nthrough a randomized double-blind clinical trial in which we find TSLP induction to promote a robust immune\nactivation against skin cancer precursors and their complete clearance. In order to determine the precise\nmechanism of TSLP-induced immune response against early premalignant cells in the breast, and to extend\nour findings to other similar immune factors in high-risk patients, we aim to (1) determine the immune cells and\nsignals that target breast premalignant cells in response to TSLP, (2) investigate the role of other immune\nfactors released by breast cells that can induce immune response to block breast cancer development, and (3)\ndetermine the factors that are driving the immune response in the breast glands of patients with genetic\nmutations and utilize them for induction of an optimal immune response against early breast cancer. The\noutcomes of the proposed research will establish a foundation for the use of the immune system in blocking\nbreast cancer development and provide novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer immunoprevention.

project	1U01CA233100-01	9625897	2018	Molecular and immune drivers of immunotherapy responsiveness in prostate cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nDespite recent advances in treatment, metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains\nincurable, and approximately 30,000 men die of this disease yearly. Advances in immunotherapy with drugs\ntargeting immune checkpoints have raised hopes that these agents will improve outcomes for mCRPC\npatients. While initial studies of immune checkpoint blockade have been unsuccessful, emerging evidence\nsuggests a subset of prostate cancer (PCa) patients can respond, although the mechanisms of PCa\nimmunotherapy response and resistance are incompletely characterized. Work in other immunotherapy\nresponsive malignancies has found several predictive immune and tumor-intrinsic properties that contribute to\nresponse, but the extent to which these (or other) features are operant in PCa is largely unknown. For\nexample, we recently identified mutations in a chromatin remodeling complex that mediates immunotherapy\nresponse through T cell interactions in solid tumors, and in parallel discovered a previously unknown PCa\ngenomic subclass defined by mutations in these same chromatin remodelers. These findings indicate that\ntumor-intrinsic epigenetic dysregulation may also interact with the immune system to modulate PCa\nimmunotherapy responsiveness. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that multiple immune and tumor-\nintrinsic properties mediate PCa interactions with the immune system, and these interactions can be modified\nthrough selective targeting in combination with checkpoint blockade to expand the therapeutic potential of\nimmunotherapy in PCa. We will leverage our team's deep experience in clinically grounded molecular\ncharacterization and preclinical models that can test immunotherapy combinations in PCa to define the\nprocesses that govern the immunotherapy landscape in PCa. The proposed specific aims are: 1) Define the\nsystemic and infiltrating immune states in PCa associated with clinical response to checkpoint blockade; 2)\nEstablish the immunologic impact of chromatin dysregulation and inhibition in PCa; and 3) Determine the\nimpact of existing DNA damaging agents for sensitizing PCa to PD-1 blockade. This proposal leverages the\nextensive, novel, and complementary resources at both Dana-Farber/Broad Institute and University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, led by highly collaborative investigators and an international scientific team, to\naddress the hypotheses outlined herein. Through a combination of functional, molecular, and clinical\napproaches inherent in these studies, our team is poised to identify mCRPC cohorts that may benefit from this\ntreatment paradigm, determine strategies to augment the use of checkpoint inhibitors in this disease, and\nmechanistically define the immune and tumor-intrinsic defects that drive immunoresistance in PCa. Broadly,\nthis project will provide a unique approach for the Immuno-Oncology Translation Network (IOTN) community\nand enable discovery of anti-cancer immunotherapies strategies for PCa that may have larger relevance\nacross the IOTN network and collaborating members of the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.

project	1U01CA233102-01	9625878	2018	Immunomodulation of the Tumor Microenvironment with Molecular Targeted Radiotherapy to Facilitate an Adaptive Anti-Tumor Immune Response to Combined Modality Immunotherapies	Grant	ABSTRACT\n We are developing a combined modality therapeutic approach to eradicating metastatic cancers that are\nimmunologically “cold” and do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Using an “in situ vaccine”\nregimen consisting of 12 Gy focal external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and intratumoral (IT) injection of\ntumor-specific antibody (mAb) + IL2, we have eradicated solitary, large, cold syngeneic tumors in mice. This in\nsitu vaccine converts the targeted tumor into a focus of enhanced tumor antigen presentation resulting in\nincreased T-cell infiltration and potent T-cell memory. However, the presence of an identical but untreated\nsecond tumor (2°) on a mouse’s opposite flank inhibits the effect of this treatment, preventing eradication of the\nprimary (1°) tumor treated with EBRT + IT mAb-IL2. In this setting, the untreated 2° tumor causes tumor-\nspecific immune unresponsiveness to EBRT + IT mAb-IL2 at the 1° tumor. We refer to this as concomitant\nimmune tolerance (CIT). We can overcome CIT, and eliminate both tumors by giving IT mAb-IL2 to the 1°\ntumor and EBRT to both the 1° and 2° tumors. Delivering as little as 2 Gy EBRT to the 2° tumor can overcome\nCIT. Clinically, delivery of EBRT (even low dose) to all sites of metastatic disease is problematic, but this can\neffectively be achieved using molecular targeted radiation therapy (MTRT). MTRT is increasingly entering\nclinical oncology practice and our UW team has led preclinical and clinical testing of a novel class of MTRT\nusing alkylphosphocholine (APCh) analogs that selectively deliver radiation to cancers in vivo. These show\ntumor-selective uptake in virtually all mammalian tumor cells and tumor locations tested (including > 90 tumor\nlines and in patients across various clinical trials). In a syngeneic murine melanoma model, we have observed\na potent synergy between systemically administered ICI and MTRT delivered using our next-generation APC\nanalog, 90Y-NM600. In a project that builds upon the ongoing collaborative progress of our multidisciplinary\nteam, we will now systematically optimize the potency of combining MTRT with immunotherapy to enhance\nthe immune response against immunologically cold tumors. In murine models, we will: 1) expand on\npreliminary data showing potent synergy with the combination of MTRT and ICI, 2) evaluate the capacity of\nMTRT to overcome CIT and enhance systemic anti-tumor immune response in the setting of multiple tumors\nwhere one is treated with in situ vaccine (EBRT + IT mAb-IL2) alone or in combination with ICI. Because\nmurine models do not replicate the size and spatial distribution of human metastatic cancer and because these\nfactors strongly influence the dosimetry of MTRT, we will test the immunomodulatory effects of MTRT + in situ\nvaccine in large breed companion canines (pet dogs) with naturally occurring metastatic melanoma. The\ninsights and treatment regimens developed in these studies should enable rapid translation to clinical\ntesting in patients and potentially for any type of metastatic cancer.	90Y;Address;Anatomy;Animals;Antibodies;Antigen Presentation;Biology;Cancer Model;Canis familiaris;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Companions;Data;Disease;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Distant;Dose;Epitope spreading;External Beam Radiation Therapy;Generations;Goals;Half-Life;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Human;IL2 gene;Image;Immune;Immune Evasion;Immune Tolerance;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immunocompetent;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Infiltration;Injections;Intravenous;Isotopes;Length;Location;Low Dose Radiation;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metastatic Melanoma;Modality;Modeling;Molecular Target;Monoclonal Antibodies;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Mus;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Preclinical Testing;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radioisotopes;Regimen;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Safety;Site;Soft tissue sarcoma;Spatial Distribution;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Targeted Radiotherapy;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Translations;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Immunity;Ursidae Family;Vaccination;Vaccines;Veins;Vision;Work;analog;anti-tumor immune response;cancer site;checkpoint inhibition;dosimetry;efficacy testing;immunogenic;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;insight;mRNA Expression;melanoma;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoantigens;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;novel strategies;pre-clinical;prevent;protein expression;radiation effect;research clinical testing;response;sarcoma;synergism;systemic toxicity;treatment effect;tumor;tumor eradication;tumor microenvironment;uptake;virtual	UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON	MADISON	WI	UNITED STATES	Zachary Scott Morris,JAMEY P WEICHERT	DCTD	Mansoor M Ahmed	765000	765000	2018-09-18T04:00:00Z	2018-09-18T04:00:00Z	2023-08-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-17-045	Moonshot
project	1U01CA233167-01	9626529	2018	Understanding Treatment Tolerability in Older Patients with Cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe overarching goal of this five-year grant proposal, submitted on behalf of the University of Rochester NCI\nCommunity Oncology Research Program (UR NCORP) Research Base and the Cancer and Aging Research\nGroup (CARG), in response to RFA-CA-17-052, is: to evaluate whether items from the Patient-Reported\nOutcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) are\nassociated with tolerability of treatment for advanced cancer in older patients with age-related\nconditions (i.e., disability, comorbidity, and geriatric syndromes). The growing population of older patients\nremains underrepresented in research that sets cancer care standards leading to significant disparities in\noutcomes. In our preliminary research, we found that: 1) close to 60% of older patients develop grade 3-5\ntoxicity (as measured by NCI's CTCAE) within three months of starting a new treatment regimen; items from\ngeriatric assessment (GA) were significantly associated with toxicity; 2) older patients with advanced cancer\nfrequently experience multiple symptoms that interfere with function and quality of life (QoL); and 3) older\npatients often experience toxicities that lead to early discontinuation of treatment, hospitalizations, and\nmortality. We have an unprecedented opportunity to leverage an existing multi-site cluster randomized study\nthat is currently enrolling adults aged >70 years with age-related conditions who are starting a new treatment\nregimen for advanced cancer in the UR NCORP network (URCC 13059/“GAP”) (n=700). In addition to\nclinician-rated CTCAE, GAP captures PRO measures (PRO-CTCAE, GA, satisfaction) at baseline, 4 weeks, 3\nmonths, and 6 months after the start of the new treatment regimen. Extensive data are collected on clinical\ntolerability metrics including treatment dose modifications, hospitalizations, and mortality. We will collaborate\nwith the U01 consortium to: 1) develop and compare the trajectories of PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated\nCTCAE grades 2-5 in older patients with age-related conditions; 2) evaluate associations between PRO-\nCTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with clinical tolerability metrics; 3) evaluate associations\nbetween PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with PRO endpoints (e.g., function, QoL,\nsatisfaction); and 4) validate a model that identifies older patients with age-related conditions who are at high\nrisk for poor tolerability from treatment for advanced cancer. Developed with stakeholders, our operational\ndefinition of tolerability is novel; it includes both clinical outcomes and PRO endpoints. The team, which\nincludes expertise in clinical trials (Mohile, Morrow, Janelsins, Kamen), biostatistics and data science\n(Culakova, Heckler, Pandya, Ramsdale, Zand), PRO measurement (Mohile, Duberstein, Chapman, Flannery),\nand collaborations with CARG (Hurria, Dale) and patient advocates (SCOREBoard led by Canin) is uniquely\nsuited to conduct this research. This research will address a critical gap in knowledge of how patient-reported\ntoxicity informs tolerability of treatment in older patients with advanced cancer and age-related conditions.

These methods will\nharness the potential of the patient-reported outcomes version of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for\nAdverse Events (PRO-CTCAETM) to provide previously unavailable patient perspectives on the tolerability of\ntreatments (including targeted agents, immunotherapies, and other evolving treatments for which the type,\nseverity, timing, and trajectory of adverse events is less known). Such information will help providers better\nidentify and support patients at risk for treatment discontinuation, dose reductions, and treatment delays.\nSpecifically, this study aims to: 1) perform longitudinal analyses of CTCAE and PRO-CTCAE data from trials\nconducted within the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, using traditional and innovative strategies to\nexamine AE trajectories and to produce a new reporting standard that reflects severity and fluctuations over\ntime; 2) examine PRO-CTCAE and CTCAE predictors of treatment adherence and discontinuation; and 3)\nvalidate the broader predictive value of GP5, a single item from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-\nGeneral (FACT-G) shown to predict early treatment discontinuation among women with breast cancer taking\naromatase inhibitors. The study will also explore two novel measurement models for PRO-CTCAE scores and\nCTCAE grades: a phenotypic model including co-occurrence of symptoms and a cumulative burden index\n(CBI) for characterizing the quantity of burden accumulated by patients over time. Analyses will include\ndemographic factors and insurance status to identify potential disparities.

project	1U01CA239258-01	9626217	2018	Enhancing cell therapy for brain tumors	Grant	ABSTRACT\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain cancer, with standard treatments based on\nsurgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy promoting an overall survival of approximately 15 months. This has\nled to a resurgence of interest in immune-based approaches. While augmenting immunity has been successful\nin other malignancies like melanoma and leukemia/lymphoma, their efficacy in treatment of brain tumors has\nbeen very limited. Tumor antigen heterogeneity, limited number of infiltrating lymphocytes at the tumor site,\nand failure of checkpoint inhibitor drugs to cross the blood brain barrier all represent major obstacles to\neffective immune-therapies in GBM. Altered immunity in patients with GBM further contributes to the poor\nprognoses of these tumors and their relative resistance to vaccine and checkpoint inhibitors. Utilizing healthy\ndonor immune cells in the form of adoptive cell therapy may offer a more effective alternative. However, limited\ninformation is available on the properties of effector populations that would exert effective anti-tumor activity in\nthe brain. Pioneering work by Dr. Rick Jones at Johns Hopkins University utilizing haploidentical donor\ntransplant (haplo-BMT) for brain tumors offers an opportunity to test kinetics of infused healthy donor immune\ncells in this patient population, providing a glimpse of what donor immune cells can do against brain tumors.\nPrevious experiences with haplo-BMT suggest that effector cells of the innate immunity – natural killer cells\n(NKs) and invariant natural killer T cells (iNKTs) – mediate anti-tumor activity with decreased frequency of\nrelapse. Innate immune cells are also potentially advantageous in the brain tumor setting, which affords very\nlittle tolerance for the adverse events associated with (for example) CD19-CAR T cell based-therapies. Finally,\nboth iNKT and NK cells can actively migrate to the site of GBM following the CCL2 gradient, the chemokine\nreleased by tumor cells and the surrounding tumor associated macrophages (TAM). Dr. Savoldo at\nUniversity of North Carolina has unique expertise in the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)\ntransduced T cells and iNKT cells and Dr. Bollard at Children's National has extensive experience with the\ngenetically modified T cells and NK cells. Hence, in this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that\nnontolerized innate immune cells (NKs and iNKTs) derived from healthy donors will promote anti-\ntumor immunity in patients GBM, and may be developed as effective cellular therapies. This overarching\nhypothesis will be tested in 3 Specific Aims where Dr. Jones (Aim 1) will compare the cellular signatures of\niNKTs and NK cells isolated from healthy donors versus patients with GBM. In Aim 2, Dr. Savoldo and the\nUNC team will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of healthy donor iNKT and NK cells modified to express an anti-\nB7H3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and in Aim 3, Drs. Bollard and Cruz at CNMC overcome the inhibitory\ntumor microenvironment in GBM by targeting immune suppressive tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and\nTGFβ.

project	1U01DE028227-01	9626324	2018	Stimulating Neo-Antigen Specific T Cell Responses in Head and Neck Cancers	Grant	Abstract\nNeoantigens (NeoAg) offer a unique and powerful opportunity for directing a patient’s immune response\nspecifically to cancer cells while avoiding damage to normal tissues. Methods for their reliable identification in\ntumors of moderate mutational burden such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are lacking,\nhowever, as are preclinical experimental platforms for utilizing human material to understand the possibilities\nand impediments in enabling NeoAg-specific T cells to eradicate established tumors. Working with a focused\nand collaborative team with expertise in cellular and molecular immunology, bioinformatics, and translational\noncology, we have developed a set of novel tools and approaches to address the complex tumor/immune\necosystem in new and incisive ways. These include a unique new model of tobacco-induced HNSCC\ncarcinogenesis which recapitulates many key features of the human disease including gene expression patterns\nof activated oncogenes, a powerful new combined bioinformatic and functional analysis platform the identification\nof NeoAg by these tumors can be recognized by the host immune system, a novel preclinical model of\ncombination radio-immunotherapy through which NeoAg-specific responses can be induced and sustained\n(Sharabi/Sharma), and finally, a new preclinical model of tumor-induced unresponsiveness in the setting of\nadoptive cellular therapy using human HNSCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors and patient-matched\ntumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) specific for an identified NeoAg. Together, these studies will address the\nhypothesis that autologous NeoAg-specific T cells can eradicate HNSCC tumors as well as defining the key\nquantitative and qualitative parameters governing therapeutic efficacy.

project	1U01DE028233-01	9625949	2018	Targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and immuno-radiotherapy for oral cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT:\nRadiation therapy (RT) is a mainstay of cancer treatment. However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it\npossible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence\nat a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor\ncells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune-\nstimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine\nRT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the\ntypes of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating\neffects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral\ncancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived\nsuppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate.\nStudies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an\nimmunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti-\ntumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor\nmicroenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of\ntumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1)\ndetermine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer\nto RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the\nimmunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug\nformulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will\naccomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims:\nIn Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance\nin mouse oral cancer models.\nIn Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment\nwith RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses.\nIn Aim 3 we will develop a novel drug delivery system that can enhance delivery of inhibitors of MDSC function\ndirectly to the tumor and tumor-infiltrating MDSC.

project	1U24CA232980-01	9625339	2018	Coordinating Center for Research Centers for Improving Management of Symptoms During and Following Cancer Treatment	Grant	Project Summary\nTo advance the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM Initiative to accelerate cancer research and the Blue Ribbon\nPanel's recommendation to minimize cancer treatment's debilitating side effects, RTI International proposes to\nserve as the Coordinating Center (CC) for the Research Centers (RCs) for Improving Management of\nSymptoms Across Cancer Treatments (IMPACT) Consortium. As the CC, RTI will provide leadership, scientific\nexpertise, and logistical support to unite RCs into a cohesive research group that will provide actionable\nevidence based on implementation science principles to improve symptom management across the cancer\ntreatment continuum (i.e., treatment with curative intent, treatment with noncurative/palliative intent, cancer\nsurvivorship) and address the unique challenges of minority and medically underserved populations.\nSpecifically, we will (1) enhance research efficiency, productivity, and impact by facilitating collaboration and\nproviding the logistical, communications, and operational support necessary to run a multicenter research\nConsortium; (2) facilitate the development of evidence-based symptom management recommendations by\nestablishing processes for harmonized data collection, the use of common data elements, and the application\nof consistent procedures across studies and research sites; and (3) accelerate adoption of integrated systems\nfor monitoring and managing patient-reported symptoms by developing and applying analytic approaches to\nIMPACT pooled data and collaborating with RCs and other stakeholder to broadly disseminate findings. This\napplication has specific strengths that will enhance the scientific productivity of the Consortium: (1) Under the\nleadership of Dr. Barbara Kroner, the CC will foster collaboration within the IMPACT Consortium by uniting\ndiverse researchers around shared goals and harmonized studies to advance the research agenda. (2) RTI will\npromote effective communication by developing custom web-based tools for communications, document\nsharing, and online trainings; establishing and leading SC working groups in topics relevant to IMPACT (e.g.,\nHealth Disparities; Implementation Science; Data Management, Statistics, and Informatics). (3) RTI will use a\ncommon implementation framework (i.e., Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance\n(RE-AIM)) combined with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research) to concurrently evaluate\nmultilevel factors that can influence clinical practice by assessing both effectiveness and implementation\noutcomes. (4) RTI will leverage data standards and harmonization across the Consortium to catalyze data\nsharing and aggregation. (5) RTI will advocate for a Stakeholder Advisory Group to guide and inform pooled\nstudy design, data collection, analyses, and interpretation of study findings. (6) RTI will combine the\nharmonized data with planned pooled analyses which will yield optimal management system models for\nimplementing integrated systems into routine clinical practice and use implementation science approaches to\naccelerate adoption of integrated systems and sustain changes in clinical practice.

Development of the Cellular\nImmunotherapy Data Resource (CIDR) will leverage the CIBMTR infrastructure for database development,\ndata sharing, networking with participating centers, and clinical research in cellular therapy for the treatment of\ncancer. Additionally, innovative approaches to optimize capture of long-term follow-up data from recipients of\ngenetically modified cells will be explored, such as utilization of electronic patient-reported outcome tools.\nProviding access to high quality data for research is among the main goals of the CIDR. The proposed project\nemploys a variety of methods to promote use of the resource, including access to prepared datasets, reports\nand publications, rapid response to requests for custom datasets, and a system to evaluate and prioritize\nrequests for statistical support. The latter will be provided by statisticians with deep expertise in survival\nanalysis. Finally, collaboration with multiple stakeholders, including professional societies, accreditation bodies,\nindustry, treating centers, and investigators representing multiple areas of oncology, hematology, cell\nprocessing, and immunology will optimize utilization of the CIDR resource and advance the rapidly emerging\nfield of cellular immunotherapy.

Specifically, we will (1) enhance productivity of\nACCSIS Program members and stakeholders by providing necessary logistical, communications, and\noperational support; (2) support the generation of the evidence base on multilevel interventions to increase\nCRC screening by establishing common data elements and harmonized data collection procedures across\nresearch projects; (3) identify and support locally-developed innovative approaches to accelerate the\nevaluation of additional promising interventions to increase CRC screening; and (4) generate a user-friendly\ndata repository and disseminate program findings to facilitate the adaption and scale-up of successful\ninterventions. RTI has specific strengths that will enhance the scientific productivity of the program, including\nthe following six. (1) We will use previously tested procedures and policies, based on our experience as the\nCC for more than 35 multisite projects, to enhance coordination among ACCSIS studies. (2) Our team, led\nby Dr. Sujha Subramanian, has more than a decade of experience in CRC screening studies, and will be\nsupported by a multidisciplinary team of experts in implementation science, heath systems and community\nclinical linkages, heath disparities, multisite data collection, biostatistics, ethics and health data regulations,\nweb design, data repository management, and dissemination. (3) We will enhance existing frameworks for\ncommon data collection that we have developed through our partnership with more than 40 CRC\nimplementation programs by expanding the frameworks to include moderators and mediators. Expansion will\nallow us to understand the underlying pathways at each level of the intervention (patient, provider, and\norganization or community). (4) We will draw upon our ready-built network of CRC stakeholders to\nincorporate lessons learned from prior implementation studies and to identify locally-developed innovative\napproaches. (5) We will leverage internal expertise in implementation science methods and conduct mixed\nanalysis using both quantitative and qualitative data to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cross-\nsite findings from the multilevel interventions. (6) We will combine our leadership in communication science\nmethods with our award-winning multimedia team to deliver an evidence-based branding strategy and\ndissemination plan to increase the visibility and reach of the ACCSIS Program.

project	1U24CA233243-01	9627305	2018	Human Tumor Atlas Network: Data Coordinating Center	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nWe propose the establishment of a data coordinating center (DCC) for the Human Tumor Atlas\nNetwork (HTAN) with responsibilities for ​managing, curating, and disseminating the data and\nresources generated through this network. We will provide key services to organize and support\nthe Research Centers that comprise this network, and foster a community based on\ncollaboration, transparency, and sharing. Our primary scientific objective is to accelerate the\ndiscovery of mechanisms governing tumorigenesis, progression, and evolution, which will lead\nto improved prevention and treatment strategies for patients. We aim to achieve this by\nproviding technology services coupled with best practices to expedite data acquisition and\ndissemination to HTAN researchers, as well as the broader scientific community. Computational\npipelines will be developed and shared to enable data harmonization, and analytic tools and\nvisualizations will be hosted on cBioPortal to facilitate data access and analysis for a wide\nspectrum of users ranging from data scientists and statisticians to biologists and clinicians. We\nwill also host crowd-sourced challenges to engage researchers outside of HTAN to address\nimportant scientific questions.

project	1U2CCA233195-01	9626781	2018	The Cellular Geography of Therapeutic Resistance in Cancer	Grant	Most patients who die from cancer do so because their cancer is resistant to available therapies, either\nintrinsically, or as it evolves in response to treatment. However, the fundamental mechanisms driving resistance\nremain largely unknown. Tumors are comprised of a complex multicellular ecosystem of malignant and non-\nmalignant cells, and changes in their composition, states, spatial organization and interactions are central to\ntherapeutic resistance. Thus, there is an enormous need to chart an atlas of a tumor's cells, their spatial\norganization and interactions as those change dynamically in resistance to therapy. Technological\nbreakthroughs in spatial and single-cell genomics, including many innovations by our team, now put an atlas\nwithin reach, but harnessing this remarkable opportunity, requires collection of multiple spatial and single cell\ngenomics data in clinical samples; novel study design strategies; new experimental and computational strategies\nto integrate across cellular and spatial data; algorithms to construct tumor atlases that capture the resistant state;\nand showing how to use an atlas to formulate and test new predictive models of resistance. The Boston Human\nTumor Atlas Network Research Center (HTA-RC) will address each of these challenges by creating three\ncomprehensive atlases of the cellular geography of human cancer to understand how changes in the\ntumor ecosystem lead to therapeutic resistance in: (1) Primary and acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition\nin breast cancer; (2) Primary and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic melanoma;\nand (3) Primary resistance to immunotherapy in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinoma (CRC)\ncompared with microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC. All three tumors types tackle an unmet clinical need; have an\napproximately equal rate of resistance and response to allow comparisons between states; and harness\nsignificant clinical experience and build on substantial preliminary results at our center. To construct the atlases,\nwe will collect at least 100 biospecimens per year from resections and biopsies of the three tumor types and\nanalyze them with histopathological data, high-resolution spatial multiplex RNA and protein data, single-\ncell genomics data, and temporal clinical data. Our algorithms will recover key features of each data modality,\nand integrate them into a single atlas to determine what predicts and underlies resistance. We build on a\nwell-established interdisciplinary team in two major cancer centers (DFCI, MGH) and four research\ninstitutions (Broad, Harvard, Stanford, Princeton). Our leadership (Haining, Regev) and Units comprise of\nforemost experts and pioneers in clinical genomics (Biospecimens; Johnson, Wagle), spatial and single cell\ngenomics (Shalek, Rozenblatt-Rosen, Nolan, Zhuang), and computational biology and data science (Regev,\nVan Allen, Engelhardt). Our atlases will allow identification of predictive biomarkers of resistance in the tumor\necosystem, and therapeutic target discovery, targeting diverse facets of the complex tumor ecosystem.

project	1U2CCA233238-01	9627274	2018	The Lung PCA: A Multi-Dimensional Atlas of Pulmonary Premalignancy	Grant	Abstract:\nLung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide chiefly due to our inability to detect the\ndisease at its earliest stage and the lack of interventions to prevent its development in those at highest risk.\nThe rate-limiting step to developing new approaches for lung cancer detection and prevention is our lack of\nunderstanding of the earliest molecular and cellular changes associated with lung carcinogenesis. We propose\nto develop a high-resolution, multidimensional genetic, molecular, and cellular atlas of pre-cancerous lung\nlesions and their surrounding microenvironment for lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, the\ntwo most common subtypes of lung cancer. We will leverage unique retrospective and prospective cohorts\nassembled at multiple medical centers via our Biospecimen Unit to collect, annotate, and process premalignant\nlesion biospecimens of the lung and airway. Our Characterization Unit will apply existing and emerging\nmolecular profiling tools to characterize the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic landscape of these lesions.\nPipelines for standardized multidimensional data processing, quality control, analysis and integration will be\ndeveloped by our Data Analysis Unit, leading to creation of a web-based portal for data dissemination and\nonline integrative analysis to benefit the greater research community. Cross-sectional sampling of\npremalignant squamous and adenomatous lesions adjacent to early stage cancer will enable development of a\nspatial map that will provide insights into the evolution of premalignant cells and their microenvironment. Our\nlongitudinal study of airway premalignant squamous lesions that progress toward or regress away from\ninvasive carcinoma will provide both a temporal and spatial map of the molecular determinants of invasive\ncarcinoma. We will also leverage this longitudinal study to demonstrate the clinical utility of our Lung Pre-\nCancer Atlas through development of prognostic biomarkers of premalignant progression that can be applied\nclinically for precision management, as well as to stratify patients with aggressive premalignant squamous\nlesions into early-phase intervention trials. Successful completion of the Atlas will be accelerated by: (1) a\nhighly-coordinated Administrative Core that will facilitate interactions within and across Units, as well as the\nexchange of data, methods, and tools with other centers within the HTAN; and (2) partnerships with ongoing\nNCI, foundation, and industry lung premalignancy initiatives. Our Lung Pre-Cancer Atlas will ultimately serve\nas a resource for the medical and scientific communities to enable the development of biomarkers for early\ndetection and risk stratification, as well as identification of novel targets for therapies that will intercept the\ndevelopment of lung cancer.

project	1U2CCA233254-01	9627374	2018	Breast Pre-Cancer Atlas Center	Grant	ABSTRACT – Overall\nDevelopment of invasive breast cancer may frequently progress through a preinvasive precursor called ductal\ncarcinoma in situ (DCIS). DCIS is an extremely common clinical diagnosis that is essentially a disease of\nscreening triggered by the detection of abnormal breast calcifications on mammography. Before the advent of\nmammography, DCIS was an incidental and relatively uncommon finding. Over 60,000 women in the United\nStates will be presented with this diagnosis each year with relatively weak evidence-based guidance for\ndisease management which ranges from active surveillance to bilateral mastectomy. We propose to compile\nmulti-dimensional and multi-scale information on DCIS to construct a Pre-Cancer Atlas that can be used to\nbetter understand the disease but also to better stratify risk of progression, a useful translational endpoint. To\ndo this, we have assembled a team of investigators with deep and complementary clinical, experimental, and\nquantitative expertise and experience with DCIS and breast cancer in general. Further, we conduct these\nstudies with full consideration of tumor evolution and ecology as it pertains to precancer development and\nprogression. Specific aspects of the proposed Atlas construction include: 1) Several types of DCIS cohorts that\nwill capture spatial and longitudinal information including a prospective clinical trial cohort undergoing active\nsurveillance, 2) Analyses designed to maintain relevant spatial organization of the disease for evolutionary and\nAtlas building considerations based on 3) Radiologic-histologic-cellular-molecular registration approaches, 4)\nCharacterization at multiple scales including whole tumor, single duct and single cell levels, 5) Characterization\nof relevant parameters including mutations, copy number changes, methylation, gene expression, and\nmicroenvironmental elements including inflammatory cell profiles. 6) Incorporation of the breast cancer intrinsic\nsubtype paradigm into the analytic phase, and 7) Layered, spatial, and longitudinal data visualization. Overall,\nthis work will provide a comprehensive platform to guide the next generation of studies on DCIS and other\nprecancers.

project	1U2CCA233262-01	9627416	2018	Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center)	Grant	SUMMARY-ABSTRACT\n The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre-\nmalignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre-\nmelanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to\nmyeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as\nshaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the\nCenter for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary\ntechnical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision\nprevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the\nmolecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk\nindividuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials.\nThis will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex\ntissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.\n Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination\nwith HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with\nthree subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists\nand a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological\nspecimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository\nwill provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in\nprospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an\noncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high-\nplex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic\nimmunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate\nreagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications.\nAim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to\nmanage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most\ntechnically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each\nin preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm\ndevelopment. The resulting human browsable and machine-readable atlases are expected to yield new\nscientific discoveries, demonstrate the feasibility and utility of new technologies and help to reduce the\nincidence of life-threatening cancers of the skin and blood.

project	1U2CCA233280-01	9627504	2018	Omic and Multidimensional Spatial Atlas of Metastatic Breast and Prostate Cancers	Grant	ABSTRACT - Overall\nWe propose to create an Omic and Multidimensional Spatial (OMS) Atlas that will enable discovery of\nmechanisms of resistance that arise in individual patients with metastatic breast and prostate cancer during\ntreatment with current generation targeted therapeutic combinations and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The\nOMS Atlas is motivated by the fact that these treatments typically are only transiently effective in the metastatic\nsetting. Possible resistance mechanisms may be intrinsic to the tumor cells or derive from the diverse\nmicroenvironments in which the tumor cells live. The OMS Atlas will focus on elucidating these resistance\nmechanisms in three specific current generation clinical scenarios: (a) hormone-receptor positive breast cancer\n(HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, (b) triple negative\nbreast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and (c)\ncastration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) undergoing treatment with enzalutamide. We will accomplish this\nthrough work in four areas. A Biospecimen Unit will prospectively collect, manage, and distribute longitudinal\nclinical information, blood, and biopsies from 20 patients from each of two metastatic breast cancer cohorts and\none prostate cancer cohort that will be analyzed to create three OMS Atlases. The biopsies will be preserved to\nenable analyses using multiple characterization modalities. A Characterization Unit will analyze (a) OCT frozen\nspecimens using Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) and Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing ATAC-\nseq (sci-ATAC-seq) to elucidate spatially defined genomic changes and chromatin accessibility in single cells,\n(b) formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to\nassess the immune microenvironment and cyclic Immunofluorescence (cycIF) to assess the composition and\nmolecular states of tumor cells and their microenvironments, and (c) paraformaldehyde fixed, resin embedded\n(PFRE) specimens using a Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM) to identify\nultrastructural changes in 2D images and targeted 3D images with 4-nm resolution. Omic characterization of the\nsame tumor samples will be provided by the SMMART Program. A Data Analysis Unit will develop and deploy\ntools to (a) manage, analyze, and visualize Tier 1 data comprised of raw sequence data and images to generate\nunimodal Tier 2 results, (b) integrate omics and imaging data through crosswise mapping to create single\ntimepoint tumor maps and quantify systems biological functions of tumor cellular subpopulations to generate Tier\n3 results, and (c) explore differences between pre- and on/post-treatment tumor maps to reveal mechanisms of\nresistance that comprise Tier 4 results. We will collaborate with private sector partners to evaluate and adopt\nnext generation technologies that increase analytical power and speed and reduce costs. The Administrative\nUnit will facilitate the coordination, operation, interaction, and evaluation of activities within the OMS Atlas and\nbetween OMS Atlas scientists and the HTAN.

project	1U2CCA233291-01	9627573	2018	Integrative Single-Cell Atlas of Host and Microenvironment in Colorectal Neoplastic Transformation	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top three most prevalent cancers in\nglobal incidence and mortality. Most of these cancers develop from pre-cancerous adenomas. Colonoscopy is\ncurrently the most effective CRC prevention strategy. However, colonoscopy may fail to prevent carcinoma in\nas many as 24% of cases, is less effective at preventing proximal CRCs, is expensive for health care systems\nto implement, carries economic and psychosocial burdens for patients, and can be complicated by bleeding,\nperforation, and other adverse events. There is an unmet need to develop new preventive strategies and risk\nstratification models to address these and other issues. By analysis of whole human tissue, seminal work from\nBert Vogelstein and co-workers demonstrated that CRC develops from an accumulation of genetic events as\ntumors evolve from small to large adenomas and, eventually, to cancers. More recently, our group reported the\nfirst comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of CRC, which also was from a bulk analysis of whole\ntissue Despite this wealth of data on CRC, we believe that the ability to provide the most effective precision\ndiagnostics and preventive strategies can only be achieved with single-cell analysis. Through such a single-cell\nanalysis, we propose to map spatial relationships across the spectrum of normal colon, early polyps, and late\nadenomas, including their unique stromal and microbial microenvironments. Aim 1: To construct a pre-cancer\natlas of colorectal adenoma progression that depicts the spatial landscape of the tumor ecosystem, including\nthe stroma and biofilm-associated microbiome, using single-cell (sc)RNA-seq, whole exome sequencing,\nmultiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), and species-specific bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\nAim 2: To integrate the activities and data from the Biospecimen, Tissue Characterization and Data Analysis\nUnits for the prospective standardized collection and analysis of colorectal tissue, associated biospecimens,\nand related clinical and epidemiological data from 1,800 participants undergoing colonoscopy or surgical\nresection. Aim 3: To disseminate the pre-cancer atlas, related biospecimens, primary data sets and analytical\ntools to the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), the broader scientific community, and the lay public. To\naccomplish these aims, we have assembled a highly interactive and established team of investigators with\ncomplementary expertise (epidemiologists, gastroenterologists, pathologists, surgeons, systems biologists,\nbioinformaticians, cancer biologists, immunologists, and biofilms/infectious disease experts). To further\noptimize our novel methodologies for application to the prospectively collected samples from 1,800 atlas\nparticipants, we will leverage our existing large repository of colorectal adenomas and supporting\nbiospecimens, generated and curated through an ongoing epidemiological project through 3 cycles of the\nVanderbilt GI Special Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE). We are confident that our application, in\ntoto, is greater than the sum of its parts, and we look forward to robust bi-directional interactions with HTAN.

project	1U2CCA233303-01	9627644	2018	Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract: Overall\nDiverse areas of cancer research have progressed to the point that it is now feasible to meaningfully integrate\nresearch data and clinical information across the molecular, cellular, and tissue realms into a larger, more\ndetailed picture of the onco-dynamics of cancer, including spatial-temporal details during cancer treatment and\nprogression. Physicians and researchers at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the\nSiteman Cancer Center (WUSM-SCC) are longtime leaders in the allied sub-disciplines of cancer, including\ngenomics, proteomics, imaging, functional characterization, pathology, clinical trials, and clinical care. WUSM-\nSCC is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, which sees ~9,000 new cancer patients annually.\nBuilding on our expertise, established infrastructure, large patient population, and extraordinary institutional\ncommitment, we propose to develop the Washington University Human Tumor Atlas Research Center (WU-\nHTARC) within the NIH Human Tumor Analysis Network (HTAN).\nWe will focus on generating organ-specific human tumor atlases for three high priority cancer types associated\nwith exceptionally poor prognosis: the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), glioblastoma (GBM), and\npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Collectively, we will analyze ~1,600-2000 samples collected from\nspatially separated locations and at different time points along the clinical treatment course from 300-375\npatients (selected from ~750 recruited patients) for the duration of the project. In addition to standard\nhistopathological analyses, bulk DNA/RNA sequencing, proteomics, and clinical imaging, etc., we will conduct\ncutting-edge, comprehensive analyses, including single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), multiplexed\nimmunofluorescent protein localization (MxIF), mass cytometry/Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF) cellular\ncharacterization, metabolomics analysis, innovative imaging, and 3-D modeling.\nWe have established infrastructure covering the aforementioned areas, from specimen procurement\n(Biospecimen Unit), to multidisciplinary analyses modules (Characterization Unit), and to analysis pipelines\n(Data Analysis Unit). Data generated from this study will be valuable for revealing the clonal evolution of the\ntumor cells from longitudinally collected specimens and to reconstruct the tumor ecosystem involving non-\ncancer cells and acellular structures. Our atlases will have comprehensive data integration at the 3D level over\ntime, providing unprecedented 4D models for the 3 selected cancer types. Our established infrastructure and\ncontinuous efforts in incorporating new technologies in omics, imaging, and informatics, will help ensure our\natlases will be the state-of-the-art, taking full advantage of the latest progress in these fields and will continue\nto evolve beyond the pilot phase to facilitate cancer research and improve clinical care.\nThe proposed atlases target a set of critically important clinical questions, including tumor resistance that has\nlong been a challenge for GBM treatment and also an important clinical problem in BRCA/TNBC and PDAC, in\nwhich minority populations are disproportionately affected. Other emphases are BRCA response/resistance to\nchemotherapy, PDAC metastasis, and GBM local recurrence in conjunction with resistance to therapy. These\natlases can cross reference each other for pan-cancer analyses. We will also seek to cooperate with any Pre-\nCancer Atlas (PCA) centers studying these disease types to maximize the temporal continuity of research on\nthese cancers. The similarities and differences among the three selected cancer types will provide synergy\namong the three atlases and will also allow us to accumulate valuable knowledge in atlas building for other\ncancer types. The data, specimens, and experience gained by our center will be shared with HTAN and the\nbroader research community to foster the next important discoveries in personalized cancer medicine.	3-Dimensional;Affect;Anatomy;Archives;Area;Atlases;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;Cancer Biology;Cancer Center;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cataloging;Catalogs;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Clonal Evolution;Clonality;Collaborations;Communities;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Cytometry;DNA;Data;Data Analyses;Data Set;Dimensions;Discipline;Disease;Drug resistance;Ecosystem;Ensure;Evolution;FAIR principles;Fostering;Foundations;Future;Generations;Genes;Genome;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Goals;Histopathology;Human;Image;Immune;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Individual;Institutes;Knowledge;Link;Location;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medicine;Methodology;Minority;Modeling;Molecular;Mutate;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organ;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathology;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Physicians;Pilot Projects;Population;Positron-Emission Tomography;Process;Proteins;Proteome;Proteomics;Recurrence;Reporting;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resistance;Sampling;Series;Site;Slice;Solid Neoplasm;Spatial Distribution;Specimen;Structure;Time;Tissues;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Validation;Washington;anticancer research;biomarker discovery;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell type;chemotherapy;clinical application;clinical care;clinical imaging;cohesion;data integration;density;drug development;exome sequencing;experience;genome sequencing;imaging informatics;improved;in vivo;innovation;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;malignant breast neoplasm;medical schools;metabolome;metabolomics;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;new technology;new therapeutic target;outcome forecast;patient population;relational database;response;single-cell RNA sequencing;synergism;therapeutic development;therapy resistant;three dimensional structure;tool;transcriptome sequencing;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma;tumor;tumor progression;whole genome	WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY	SAINT LOUIS	MO	UNITED STATES	Samuel  Achilefu,Li  Ding,Ryan C Fields,William E.

project	1U2CCA233311-01	9627723	2018	Precancer Atlas of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis	Grant	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third highest cause of cancer death in the United States. Almost 80% of\nsporadic colorectal cancers have an APC gene mutation. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a hereditary\ncolon cancer syndrome, is also caused by mutations in APC and affects children as young as 7 years of age.\nFAP causes hundreds of colonic polyps in affected individuals and a 100% lifetime risk of CRC. In preliminary\nefforts we have successfully collected hundreds of pre-cancerous colon polyps from individual FAP patients,\napplied genomic, epigenomic and other multi-omic analyses and begun to elucidate the impact of multiple\ntypes of “omic” alterations on precancerous colon polyp evolution toward CRC. We propose to use an\nintegrated and collaborative approach to develop a PreCancer Atlas for colorectal adenocarcinoma using FAP\nas the disease model. We will:\n1) Establish a biospecimen collection pipeline for procurement of longitudinal tissue samples during\nsurveillance colonoscopy and during prophylactic surgical colectomy, including whole blood, serum, normal\ncolonic tissue, colon microbiome, benign pre-cancerous polyps, dysplastic precancerous polyps and colon\nadenocarcinomas. The material will be used for our own center and will also be available to the Human Tumor\nAtlas Network (HTAN). Medical records, longitudinal samples and all relevant metadata will also be collected.\n2) Establish a center to characterize the tissue samples with state-of-the-art omics and imaging technologies.\nThese include but are not limited to whole genome sequencing, methylation, transcriptome, proteome,\ncytokine, metabolome, microbiome, and molecular imaging.\n3) Establish an analysis core that analyzes and integrates results from -omics, imaging and medical\ninformation, builds a spatiotemporal, multidimensional, integrative multi-omics cancer atlas, and develops\nlongitudinal and predictive models for PreCancer biology and progression, as well as data portal and\nvisualization framework.\n4) Establish multi-omics technologies on smaller number of samples.\n5) Perform a “multiscale deep data analysis” on a large number of samples (57) from a few people and a fewer\nnumber of samples (6) from many people. Use this information to guide additional data collection.\n6) Identify factors (e.g. germline genetics, microbiome, immune dysfunction) contributing to polyp\nheterogeneity between and across individuals. Build disease progression models based on these data.\n7) Make all biospecimens, information, protocols and software available to the PCA, HTAN and the general\nscientific community.\nWe expect our efforts will greatly facilitate understanding CRC at its earliest stages and serve as a model for\nunderstanding precancerous lesions of other solid tumor malignancies.	7 year old;APC gene;Adenocarcinoma;Adenomatous Polyposis Coli;Affect;Atlases;Automobile Driving;Benign;Biological Models;Biology;Cancer Etiology;Cause of Death;Cessation of life;Child;Colectomy;Collection;Colon Adenocarcinoma;Colon Carcinoma;Colonic Polyps;Colonoscopy;Colorectal Adenocarcinoma;Colorectal Cancer;Colorectal Polyp;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease model;Epigenetic Process;Event;Evolution;Family;Gene Mutation;Genetic;Genomics;Health;Heterogeneity;Human;Image;Imaging technology;Immune System Diseases;Individual;Inherited;Integration Host Factors;Lead;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical;Medical Records;Metabolic;Metadata;Methylation;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Normal tissue morphology;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Pilot Projects;Polyps;Precancerous Polyp;Premalignant;Prevention strategy;Proteome;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Research Personnel;Sampling;Serum;Solid Neoplasm;Syndrome;System;Technology;Therapeutic;Tissue Sample;Tissues;United States;Whole Blood;base;collaborative approach;colon microbiome;colorectal cancer risk;cytokine;data portal;data visualization;epigenomics;experience;genome sequencing;lifetime risk;metabolome;microbiome;molecular imaging;multiple omics;novel;novel strategies;predictive modeling;prophylactic;spatiotemporal;transcriptome;treatment strategy;tumor;whole genome	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	STANFORD	CA	UNITED STATES	JAMES M.

project	1U54CA231637-01	9600132	2018	The Center for Therapeutic Targeting of EWS-oncoproteins	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall\nThe primary scientific focus of this Center is to understand the molecular underpinnings of EWS-ETS driven\nEwing sarcoma and to investigate novel treatments and therapeutic mechanisms to improve outcomes for\npediatric patients with this aggressive disease. Translation of molecular understanding of sarcoma\npathophysiology into effective new drugs in the clinic is a complex, risky proposition that requires the coordinated\nefforts of a talented team of individuals with complementary skills. This group brings expertise in Ewing sarcoma\nbiology and the EWS-ETS oncoproteins, epigenetics and transcription, structural biology, computational biology,\nchemical biology and drug development, mouse models, preclinical experimental therapeutics, and clinical trials\ndevelopment. A Center mechanism is essential to the success of this proposal. No one institution nor individual\ncan bring mastery of the diversity of approaches, technologies, and scientific domains needed to achieve the\ngoals of this proposal. We have elected to focus on understanding the fundamental inner workings of Ewing\nsarcoma from its transcriptional circuits, to the direct protein interactions with EWS-FLI1, to the direct and\nimmediate effects of EWS-FLI1 degradation. Moreover, a strong emphasis of this proposal is on target\nidentification and preclinical validation, critical steps in the process of bringing forward therapies with optimal\nchances for success in the clinic. The team that is assembled has all of the component pieces needed for\nsuccess. Our Center includes outstanding basic cancer biologists, chemists, computational biologists, and\ntranslational researchers, and five pediatric oncologists. Thus, the proposed Center can catalyze basic discovery\nand clinical translation by leveraging basic and clinical research talent within the Center and our strong ties to\noutside academic and industrial partners.

project	1U54CA231638-01	9600147	2018	The Center for Synovial Sarcoma Biology and Therapeutics	Grant	The Center for Synovial Sarcoma Biology and Therapeutics \nAbstract \nThe overarching goal of this FusOnC2 Center for Synovial Sarcoma Biology and Therapeutics is to develop and execute a comprehensive, multidisciplinary set of approaches rooted in protein biochemistry and structural biology to define the mechanistic underpinnings of synovial sarcoma and unmask opportunities for therapeutic development. This Center’s mission is tightly aligned with that of the larger Consortium on Fusion Oncoproteins in Childhood Cancers and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative. A major impetus for the development of this Consortium has been the growing knowledge that fusion oncoproteins that are pathognomonic for specific cancer types often function via disruption of the structure and/or activity of protein complexes that govern chromatin architecture and hence gene control. We have shown that at least two of the fusion oncoproteins highlighted as major areas of emphasis within the Consortium, SS18-SSX and EWS-FLI1, bind and act via BAF complexes to drive cancer-specific oncogenic gene expression. Importantly, genetic studies across human cancer types have indicated that genes encoding encoding mSWI/SNF complex subunits are among the most frequently mutated, at over 20% of all human cancers, further underscoring the need for a detailed understanding of BAF complex structure, topology and mechanisms on chromatin. \nOur multi-institutional collaborative network seeks to comprehensively interrogate biologic mechanisms underpinning the function of the SS18-SSX oncogenic fusion protein in synovial sarcoma and to use the approaches and the results generated to launch targeted therapeutic discovery campaigns that are directly linked to the mechanisms identified. Specifically, our approach encompasses three major areas: (1) BAF complex genomic targeting, gene regulation, and chromatin state interactions, including interactions with other chromatin regulators; (2) Understanding the role of the wild-type SS18 protein, its protein-level regulation, and mechanisms by which its stabilization can reverse SS18-SSX-mediated BAF complex activity and be exploited for therapeutic benefit; (3) Mechanistically characterizing synovial sarcoma-specific vulnerabilities, centered in chromatin-bound protein complexes and related pathways. The highly integrative nature of the PI-directed research projects and expertise within collaborator laboratories provide the strongest possible likelihood that the aims will be successfully achieved and that novel therapeutic strategies will emerge from this Center.

project	1U54CA231641-01	9600275	2018	An integrated approach to analyze and target EWS/FLI in Ewing sarcoma	Grant	Overall Section Summary/Abstract\nThe overarching goal of our FusOnC2 TEST (Targeting the Ewing Sarcoma Translocation) Center is to develop a new mechanistic understanding of EWS/FLI that will allow for the development of new therapeutic approaches for Ewing sarcoma based on inhibiting EWS/FLI.  EWS/FLI is an aberrant oncogenic transcription factor formed by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal translocation that is the driver oncoprotein of this tumor.  Multiple independent studies demonstrate a critical dependence of Ewing sarcoma cells on EWS/FLI such that blockade of the translocation is associated with a loss of proliferation, loss of cell cycle progression and ultimately reversal of oncogenic transformation.  Thus, most investigators believe that inhibition of EWS/FLI in the clinic would be the best way to treat patients with Ewing sarcoma.  \n\nTraditional chemical design of EWS/FLI inhibitors has proven challenging because the molecule does not contain traditionally “druggable” pockets.  We therefore hypothesize that a deeper scientific understanding of EWS/FLI transcriptional function in Ewing sarcoma will allow for identification of new agents.\n\nThe FusOnC2 TEST Center will focus on two critical molecular features of EWS/FLI required for its transcriptional and oncogenic function:  (i) binding of EWS/FLI to GGAA-microsatellites and related DNA response elements, and (ii) EWS/FLI self-association activities to form “hubs” that coordinate protein-interactions through low-complexity domains to mediate transcriptional function.\n\nTargeting EWS/FLI requires diverse expertise to be focused on this problem.  The TEST Center is designed to facilitate both independent and highly-focused studies on critical components of EWS/FLI function, while at the same time interacting with the entire FusOnC2 consortium to share new knowledge, techniques, and expertise that will help facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches to Ewing sarcoma.  We believe that the TEST Center will contribute greatly to the overall success of the FusOnC2 Consortium, and help to change the paradigm for how new therapies are developed for pediatric translocation-associated cancers.

project	1U54CA231652-01	9600594	2018	Targeting SS18-SSX biology in synovial sarcomagenesis	Grant	Overall: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThis application responds to RFA-CA-17-049 by proposing the establishment of a center distributed across\nthree institutions with labs all focusing on the biology of the SS18-SSX (formerly called SYT-SSX) fusion\noncogene. Among the FusOnC2 consortium cancers of interest, synovial sarcoma has the highest incidence in\nthe United States and worldwide, but has been a specifically underserved malignancy due to its predilection for\nthe adolescent and young adult population and its relatively poor responsiveness to systemic therapy,\ncompared to other pediatric sarcomas that also associate with fusion oncogenes. While much of the biology of\nSS18-SSX remains unknown and synovial sarcoma patients represent a clearly underserved, orphan-disease\npopulation, there are two principles at the extremes of the cancer biology spectrum that are well established.\nFirst, SS18-SSX has proven the capacity to recapitulate synovial sarcomagenesis faithfully in the mouse\nwithout the need of introduced or stochastically acquired secondary genetic changes, second SS18-SSX has\nbiochemically demonstrated interactions with an important chromatin remodeling complex called SWI/SNF or\nBAF. This application proposes to build three research projects focused on the cell biology of transformation,\ngenome-wide chromatin biology and SWI/SNF (BAF) complex componentry biology, each related to SS18-\nSSX. These discovery biology and therapeutic target identification efforts will be supported by two shared\nresource cores that will provide human validation of therapeutic targets and preclinical testing of therapeutic\nstrategies. The group of investigators has developed as an organically assembled network of collaborations,\nbuilt over the last decade, during which time each project has gathered substantial preliminary data using a\nvariety of functional screens, a newly identified cell of origin, the ability to track SS18-SSX genome wide\nlocalization and protein interactions, a powerful system to produce and evaluate recombinant SWI/SNF (BAF)\ncomplexes with variable componentry, and powerful mouse genetic models of synovial sarcoma—including\nspontaneous development of metastatic disease. Preliminary data are sufficiently robust to recommend\ntherapeutic strategies immediately from each research project for the cores to validate and evaluate in clinically\nrelevant mouse models and quantitative molecular imaging.

project	1U54CA232568-01	9617113	2018	Discovery and Development of Optimal Immunotherapeutic Strategies for Childhood Cancers	Grant	OVERALL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\n There is a major paradox confronting the field of childhood cancer research. Several decades ago,\npioneering investigators focused on children with cancer led a revolution resulting in previously incurable\nmalignancies becoming curable. In contrast, over the last two decades, basic science has continued to\nadvance fundamental understanding of the oncogenesis of pediatric cancers, but cure rates for most pediatric\nmalignancies have plateaued, and the field has witnessed first-hand that current standard therapies often\nsaddle survivors with life threatening therapy-induced morbidities. It is sobering that for most children who\nsuffer relapse, few if any novel therapeutic options exist, and most patients receive the same type of therapy\nthat failed them in the first place. The funding opportunity arising out of the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot\ninitiative directly addresses this paradox by forming a Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery and Development\nNetwork (PI-DDN). Immunotherapy for B-ALL and neuroblastoma is now credentialed, with CD19 directed\nimmunotherapies showing unprecedented activity in highly refractory cases of lymphoid malignancies. The\nfield is now poised for a focused and sustained multi-disciplinary effort to extend these early successes, and\nrethink our approach to childhood cancer therapy in general. Here, we propose a pediatric immuno-oncology\nCenter entitled Discovery and Development of Optimal Immunotherapeutic Strategies for Childhood\nCancers. We envision this Center providing a central hub for the PI-DDN, creating additional opportunities for\nmulti-disciplinary research with the common goal of creating new cancer immunotherapies for children. This\nCenter embodies three highly integrated multi-institutional Projects supported by a single Administrative and\nStatistical Core. The overarching hypothesis to be tested here is that childhood cancers harbor lineage-specific\nmechanisms of oncogenesis and immune evasion that can be precisely and effectively targeted by rationally\ndesigned and developed immunotherapeutic regimens. Project 1 will discover lineage specific cell surface\nmolecules that have project-defined optimal attributes for synthetic immunotherapeutic based targeting, and\nuse this to create and credential new therapeutics based upon preclinical efficacy in high-risk childhood cancer\nmodels. Project 2 will focus on major mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance by developing approaches to\ncircumvent the fundamental issues of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity and T cell dysfunction due to both\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors. Project 3 will focus on a major difference between pediatric and many adult\nmalignancies, with pediatric cancers typically eliciting little adaptive immunity, and develop approaches to\nenhance adaptive immune responses against pediatric cancer-specific antigenic targets.

In addition, these minority populations remain underrepresented in therapeutic clinical\ntrials. Our Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (M-PDTC) provides a unique\nopportunity to help address these racial/ethnic disparities. This Center is built on the scientific premise that,\nin addition to important socioeconomic factors, health disparities that burden racial/ethnic minorities in\nthe US are linked to poorly understood genetic and other intrinsic factors. We propose to leverage the\nhigh numbers of minority cancer patients at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in order to generate and\nutilize innovative PDX models of diverse racial/ethnic minority origin, which will assist the entire scientific\ncommunity delineate the molecular underpinnings of cancer of racial/ethnic minority origin. Houston is the most\ndiverse large US city, with ~20% of its residents being African American (AA) and ~40% Hispanic. BCM faculty\nare responsible for clinical care at two major teaching hospitals that serve large minority populations: Ben Taub\nHospital (BTH), a public hospital (91% of patients are minorities), and the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center\n(MEDVAMC), one of the largest VA Medical Centers in the US, which serves over 100,000 veterans in Southeast\nTexas (~30% are AA). Thus, there is a very large population of minority cancer patients available for potential\ntissue donations. BCM has a long track record of successfully enrolling minority patients in clinical trials.\nIn addition to our large AA patient population at BCM, 59% of patients at BTH are of Hispanic ethnicity. We have\nassembled a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional collaborative team, bringing together experts in PDX model\ngeneration, molecular biology and signaling pathways, animal drug treatment studies, pathology and clinical\nmanagement of prostate and breast cancer from BCM and MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). We are\nideally positioned to leverage the technical resources of our institutions and our high numbers of racial and ethnic\nminority cancer patients at BCM, in order to support the broader goals of the M-PDTC RFA, in particular to\nfacilitate biospecimen donations from these populations and increase the racial and ethnic diversity of the\nPDXNet repository in a wide spectrum of cancers, as well as to support the Specific Aims of our two research\nprojects in prostate and breast cancer. Few, if any, cancer centers have this combination of an outstanding\nresearch base, large numbers of African American, Hispanic and Asian cancer patients, and BCM’s robust track\nrecord of successfully enrolling minority patients from our catchment area (Houston) into clinical trials. Moreover,\nour two research projects will utilize whole exome sequencing (WES), global RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq),\nquantitative proteomic (qKiP) and metabolomic profiling and will conduct preclinical trials of promising NCI-IND\ndrugs to uncover novel, effective treatment strategies for prostate and breast cancer in minority populations.

We have established an accomplished\ntransdisciplinary research team with an outstanding infrastructure that includes a University of California-wide\ncentral IRB system called Reliance and strong preliminary data to support the proposed PDX and cancer\ndisparities research, thus allowing our results to be easily translated to clinical trials. UCaMP is comprised of\nfour University of California NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers: UC Davis Comprehensive\nCancer Center (UC Davis), UC Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCLA), UC Irvine Health\nChao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UC Irvine), and UC San Francisco Helen Diller Family\nComprehensive Cancer Center (UCSF). Our collective strengths include complementary expertise in PDX\ndevelopment and drug testing, cancer health disparities, and clinical trial development robustly supported by\ncores for PDX, Pilot Studies, Bioinformatics, and Administration. We will achieve our goal through two\nResearch Projects. Project 1 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Gastric and Liver\nTumors, specifically addresses cancer health disparities in gastric cancers (GC) and liver cancers (LC) that\ndisproportionately affect all racial/ethnic minorities especially in HLA and AANHPI populations. By\nunderstanding the genetic and response differences among HLA, AANHPI compared to NHWs, we could\nenhance the precision of therapeutic treatments, identify resistance-associated biomarkers, and study\nresistance mechanisms to targeted therapies. Project 2 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX\nModels for Lung and Bladder Tumors focuses on treatment disparities between AA and NHW patients to\nidentify therapies targeting common genetic alterations (e.g. PI3K pathway) and to reveal targeted therapy\nresistance mechanisms for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and advanced bladder cancer (aBC).

project	1UG3CA233229-01	9627196	2018	ACCISIS-Chicago	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nScreening for colorectal cancer (CRC) not only detects disease early but also prevents cancer by finding and\nremoving precancerous polyps. The overall goal of our project, Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening\nand Follow-up through Implementation Science in Chicago (ACCSIS-Chicago), is to test a multilevel,\nmulticomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among\nracial/ethnic minority and low income populations in Chicago, Illinois. In this project, we will include two\ndifferent types of implementation strategies: 1) evidence-based multilevel, multicomponent intervention to\nincrease rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care; and 2) implementation support strategies to\nsupport the implementation process that contribute to the adoption, implementation and sustainment of our\nproposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention. We will partner with 4 federally qualified health centers\n(FQHCs), which have 35 clinics in the Chicago area and provided primary care service to nearly 188,000\nracial/ethnic minority and low income populations in 2016. During the UG3 Planning-Exploratory Phase, we will\nwork with one of the 4 FQHC partners to pilot test, measure, and refine our proposed multilevel,\nmulticomponent intervention in preparation for the experimental trial in the UH3 Implementation Phase, as well\nas assess the effectiveness of our implementation support strategies. In the UH3 Implementation Phase, we\nwill use a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and impact of our\nmultilevel, multicomponent intervention on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care\nacross our 4 partner FQHCs. The selection of our intervention components will be based on intensive literature\nreview, and findings and lessons learned from our previous studies and projects. Our multilevel intervention\ncomponents will include EMR provider reminders, provider assessment and feedback, patient navigation,\nprovider education and community outreach. We will also test one local innovation, IL ColonCARES, during the\nUGH Phase to increase the rate of follow-up after a positive stool test among uninsured patients by linking\nuninsured patients with specialty services. We expect the finding from this study to have broad impact on\nunderstanding the implementation process to increase colorectal cancer screening, follow up, and referral to\ncare across diverse health systems.

project	1UG3CA233251-01	9627357	2018	Scaling Colorectal Cancer Screening Through Outreach, Referral, and Engagement (SCORE): A State-Level Program to Reduce Colorectal Cancer Burden in Vulnerable Populations	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nDespite strong evidence that colorectal cancer (CRC) screening reduces mortality, rates of CRC screening,\nfollow-up, and referral-to-care (herein referred to as “CRC screening”) remain suboptimal in the US. In North\nCarolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions.\nCommunity health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable\npopulations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%.\nSubstantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and\nsystem-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening\ntargets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based\nscreening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase\nscreening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to\nsystematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for\nuninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from\nstakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We\nhypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective\napproaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through\nimproved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research,\nimplementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central\nhypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based\ninterventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable.\nThe specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention\nto increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot\nstudies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a\nprocess for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2\n(Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening\napproaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess\nimplementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the\nmultilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This\nproject is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation\nmodeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact\non CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities.

project	1UG3CA233282-01	9627516	2018	(ACCSIS) Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia	Grant	Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening through Implementation Science in Appalachia\nThis multi-site project aims to increase screening and follow-up for colorectal cancer (CRC) in central Appalachia,\na medically underserved region recognized as one of three distinct “hotspots” for CRC mortality. Specifically, the\nAppalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern\nKentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the\narea are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents\nscreened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence\non CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of\nKentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with\nAppalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention\nand control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted\nfrom evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the\ncommunity (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in\n12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base\nfor a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically\nunderserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden\nof CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test,\nmeasure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH\nand Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI\napproval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI\nin a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC\nscreening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2)\nAssess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with\ncommunity and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to\nearly or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined\nby US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county-\nlevel behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk\nFactor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating\nCenter, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community\npartners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia.

project	1UM1CA233033-01	9625964	2018	Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) Pragmatic Clinical Trial	Grant	Cancer and its treatment engender disabling symptoms that are frequently undertreated, and associated with\nneedlessly increased healthcare utilization, non-adherence to oncologic treatments, and reduced survival. The\nkey to addressing this damaging situation lies in reliably detecting symptoms and providing evidence-based\ncare. Of note, the National Academy of Medicine has identified systematic screening with patient reported\noutcomes (PROs) as critical, not only to symptom control, but also to enhancing the patient centricity and\neffectiveness of cancer care in general. Unfortunately, experience has shown that simply presenting PRO data\nto over-loaded, treatment-focused clinicians has minimal or no impact on the outcomes of patients with many\ndiseases, including cancer. On the other hand, providing these data to mid-level providers and entrusting them\nto initiate, monitor and adapt individually tailored symptom management plans has proven robustly effective in\nthe control of cancer-related and other symptoms. However, the high resource requirements of this approach\nhave heretofore limited its dissemination and scalability. Encouragingly, such resource intense care is not\nalways required for meaningfully benefit, as attested by the effectiveness of interventions that provide patients\nexperiencing mild or moderate with self-management education. This application recognizes the need for both\nlow- and high-touch approaches to cancer symptom control and proposes the Enhanced, EHR-facilitated\nCancer Symptom Control (E2C2) pragmatic clinical trial to test a bundled intervention that leverages EHR\ninterface and clinical decision support functionalities to operationalize the population-level implementation of an\napproach that automatically triages symptomatic patients to low-touch automated self-management (Level 1),\nor high-touch nurse care management (Level 2), both validated, depending on PRO scores, as well as patient\nand clinical factors. The E2C2 intervention will target Sleep disturbance, Pain, Anxiety, Depression, and\nEnergy deficit/fatigue, the SPADE pentad which represents the most prevalent and potentially treatable group\nof overlapping cancer symptoms. To rigorously assess the effectiveness of discrete E2C2 intervention\ncomponents, we will initially test a Stage 1 Symptom Control Bundle for 12 months, after which we will add\na Stage 2 Implementation Bundle. The trial's stepped wedge design will randomize the order of E2C2\nimplementation among 21 clusters. Clusters will be defined at the level of the cancer care team, and will be\nrandomized to one of five different tranches to receive the intervention at staggered 6 month intervals.\nOutcomes will include SPADE symptom scores (primary), physical function, social participation, quality of life,\ndistress, healthcare utilization, adherence to cancer treatment, and vital status which will be collected for 9-12\nmonths during each trial phase; pre-E2C2, Stage 1 and Stage 2. A multi-stakeholder, mixed methods\napproach will be used to comprehensively assess the impact of the Stage 2 Implementation Bundle, as well as\nboth Stages' impact on rurally-based and elderly patients, groups prone to disparities in symptom control.

project	1UM1CA233035-01	9625977	2018	Implementation and Evaluation of an Expanded Bilingual Electronic Symptom Management Program across a Multi-site, Fully-integrated Comprehensive Cancer Center	Grant	Cancer, and cancer treatment, cause many symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life. Despite the\ndevelopment of improved symptom management interventions, and several evidence- and consensus-based\nguidelines, their timely delivery remains uneven in the health care system. Our research center, Northwestern\nUniversity IMPACT (NU IMPACT), builds upon an integrated cancer symptom monitoring and management\nsystem (NMPRO), currently deployed by our health care delivery system. We will test the effectiveness of a\nsystem-wide symptom management intervention when implemented across the Northwestern Memorial\nHealthCare Corporation (NMHC) outpatient oncology clinics. Using a clinic-level randomized roll-out\nimplementation trial design, we will further test, using an embedded patient-level randomized controlled clinical\ntrial, the effectiveness of an enhanced care (EC) approach aimed to engage participants actively, and to\nincrease self-efficacy, in the monitoring and managing of their symptoms. The existing NMPRO will constitute\nusual care (UC), and added patient engagement and activation features will comprise the EC condition. This\ninnovative hybrid trial design allows for a within- and between-site evaluation of implementation along with a\nsufficiently powered group-based comparison to demonstrate effectiveness on individual patient outcomes.\n We propose three specific aims that target both patient- and system-level outcomes. Aim 1: Implement a\nfully-integrated oncology symptom assessment and management program across six clinical units that are part\nof the NMHC healthcare delivery system; Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the program by conducting a hybrid\nType I effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the enhanced care program (EC: symptom monitoring &\nself-management intervention), relative to usual care (UC) on patient- and system-level outcomes; Aim 3:\nIdentify facilitators and barriers to implementation and disseminate to other health systems. We will enroll an\nestimated 12,671 participants. To address possible contamination effects within each clinical unit, and allow for\nunit-level data collection for pre- and post-implementation comparison within and across clinical units, 50% will\nbe enrolled and followed prior to program implementation. The other half will be enrolled post-implementation\nand will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (stratified by sex and cancer phase; curative intent, non-curative\nintent & survivorship) to UC versus EC. Fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression will be assessed using\nPROMIS® computerized adaptive tests (CATs). In addition, we will assess patient clinical outcomes, including\nhealthcare utilization, and cancer treatment delivery outcomes. The NU IMPACT study design allows joint\nevaluation of system-level implementation and patient-level effectiveness metrics.

project	1UM1CA233080-01	9626037	2018	SIMPRO Research Center: Integration and Implementation of PROs for Symptom Management in Oncology Practice	Grant	Project Summary\nIn 2018, more than 1.7 million Americans will receive a new cancer diagnosis and nearly 600,000 will die from\ntheir disease. Cancer treatments, including major surgical resection and palliative chemotherapy, are\nassociated with frequent adverse symptoms. The primary burden for managing symptoms falls on patients and\ntheir caregivers, and there is ample evidence that untreated symptoms impair quality of life, lead to inefficient\nuse of emergency care, avoidable hospitalizations, and even shorten survival. Electronic tracking of patient-\nreported outcomes (ePROs) between face-to-face clinic visits has been shown to both reduce symptom burden\nand decrease the need for acute care. Although there is abundant evidence that symptom monitoring can\nimprove cancer care, current experience has been largely limited to single centers or as part of clinical trials.\nUsing ePROs to facilitate symptom control is an attractive strategy but, evidence for effectiveness in different\ntreatment contexts and across varied populations is needed. Further, ePRO tracking systems have not been\nfully integrated into health systems' electronic health records (EHR) and this deficit prevents them from\ndelivering the maximal benefits of proactive symptom management.\nTo fill gaps in the evidence base about the optimal strategy for deploying ePROs, a multidisciplinary team from\n6 health systems have formed the Symptom Management IMplementation of Patient Reported Outcomes in\nOncology (SIMPRO) Research Center. SIMPRO's overarching goal is to develop, implement, and evaluate a\nmulti-component ePRO reporting and management system to improve symptom control for patients recovering\nfrom cancer surgery or patients receiving palliative chemotherapy in small, rural, and community cancer\ncenters. The Specific Aims of the project are to: (1) Adapt existing ePRO symptom management systems and\nintegrate them into the EHR and routine clinical workflow at six health systems; (2) Determine the effectiveness\nof an EHR-integrated ePRO symptom management system on health outcomes; and (3) Evaluate the\nfacilitators and barriers to implementation of an EHR-integrated ePRO symptom management system from the\npatient, clinical and organizational perspectives. Following the adaptation of operational ePRO prototypes and\nfull integration into an EHR, the SIMPRO investigators will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial with\nstepped wedge rollout to investigate the effectiveness of a symptom monitoring system from a patient, clinician\nand health system perspective. Across all study phases, the implementation process itself, including ePRO\nadoption, appropriateness, acceptability, penetration/scalability, and adaptation, will be critically evaluated.\nThis approach will create knowledge that can be used to guide dissemination of ePROs and other interventions\nto improve cancer care delivery.

project	3R01CA124633-11A1S1	9758342	2018	Pathogenesis and Treatment of NUT-Midline Carcinoma	Grant	Project Summary Abstract. NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), with a median survival of 6.7 months, is one of\nthe most aggressive solid tumors known. It is a subtype of squamous cell carcinoma characterized by\ntranslocation of the NUT (aka NUTM1) gene, most commonly forming a fusion to the double-bromodomain\nencoding protein (BET), BRD4. There is an urgent need for the identification of more specific therapeutic\ntargets in NMC. The over-reaching goal of this proposed project is to greater understand the mechanism of\nBRD4-NUT oncogenesis and identify effective therapeutic targets for treating this disease.\n BRD4-NUT functions to block differentiation and maintain proliferation of NMC cells, largely through\nactivation of MYC expression. This function is disrupted upon treatment with BET inhibitors, which as acetyl-\nlysine mimetics prevent binding of BRD4 bromodomains to acetylated chromatin. BRD4-NUT drives the\nexpression of pro-growth target genes, including MYC, through the formation of megabase-sized massive\nhyperacetylated 'megadomains'. BRD4-NUT megadomains arise from pre-existing active enhancers and\nspread to fill cell-type-specific topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are higher order genomic\nstructures whose function is to orchestrate cell-fate determining transcriptional programs through DNA-DNA\ncontacts. Unique proteins recruited by BRD4-NUT recently identified by our group include the histone acetyl-\ntransferase (HAT), p300, and several ZNF proteins collectively termed Z4. These findings indicate that BRD4-\nNUT ‘hijacks’ cell-type specific TADs to drive transcription of pro-growth, anti-differentiative genes as\npostulated in the following model: First, BRD4-NUT complex proteins seed regions corresponding to cell-type-\nspecific active TADs through the chromatin-binding of BRD4. Second, megadomains form from contiguous\nexpansion of BRD4-NUT complexes across chromatin in a feed-forward manner dependent upon p300 HAT\nactivity. Third, megadomain size is limited by TAD boundaries and HDAC activity recruited by the Z4 complex.\nFourth, hyperacetylated chromatin, recruitment of chromatin remodelers, and upregulation of cis lncRNAs\nchanges the chromatin configuration to enhance DNA-DNA interactions to drive transcription of key pro-\ngrowth, anti-differentiative genes. The goals of this proposal are to test this hypothetical model, as listed in the\nspecific aims below.\nAim 1. To determine how BRD4-NUT megadomains form.\nAim 2. To determine how BRD4-NUT megadomains function.\nImpact. Successful completion of the aims is expected to identify key BRD4-NUT-associated proteins in\npathologic megadomain formation, and will identify novel and possibly more effective therapeutic targets in\nNMC and other cancers. In addition, we predict that BRD4-NUT megadomains will provide a model with far-\nreaching impact on the structure-function relationship of chromatin conformation in cancer and development.

project	3R01CA163915-07S1	9590552	2018	ATP-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling in Human Malignancy	Grant	ABSTRACT\nRecent exome sequencing studies have found that over 20% of human cancers have deleterious mutations in\nthe genes encoding the subunits of mSWI/SNF (BAF) complexes. A much larger number of tumors have\namplifications or deletions of these genes. These complexes are polymorphic assemblies of 15 subunits\nencoded by 28 genes giving rise to remarkable combinatorial specificity. This biologic specificity is reflected in\nthe highly selective pattern of oncogenic mutations in specific subunits in specific cancers. Cancer mutations\ngenerally have the characteristics of tumor suppressors and are generally heterozygous, implying that they\nplay a genetically dominant role in suppressing tumor formation. Work in our lab and others has led to the\nconclusion that the ability of these complexes to oppose polycomb-mediated repression contributes to their\nroles in both development and oncogenesis. Hence, we will focus our work on the mechanisms underlying the\nopposition between BAF and polycomb and its therapeutic consequences. First we will use a novel, newly\ndesigned in vivo chromatin remodeling assay to fully characterize the nature of the opposition on a minute-by-\nminute basis. Secondly, we will define the energetic requirements for BAF-polycomb opposition and the\nessential role of ATP in regulating binding and release of PRC1 from BAF. Third, we will fully characterize the\ndirect interaction between BAF and polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in terms of subunits and domains\nthat are essential for this interaction. Fourth, we will explore the consequences of disruption of BAF-polycomb\nopposition for repair, recombination and transcription over the genome. Finally, we will define the therapeutic\npotential of a group of small molecule BAF inhibitors that we identified in earlier screens. At the conclusion of\nthese studies we should have a mechanistic understanding of BAF-polycomb opposition and have explored at\nleast two potential paths for the production of cancer-specific drugs. 	ATPase Domain;Amino Acids;Binding;Biological Assay;Characteristics;Chromatin;Complex;Dependence;Development;Gene Deletion;Genes;Genetic Recombination;Genetic Transcription;Genetic study;Genome;Grant;Human;Human Genetics;Investigation;Kinetics;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Missense Mutation;Molecular;Mutation;Nature;Normal Cell;Oncogenic;PRC1 Protein;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Polycomb;Production;Proteins;Recurrence;Repression;Role;Specificity;Surface;System;Techniques;Therapeutic;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Work;base;cancer cell;chromatin remodeling;combinatorial;design;early screening;exome sequencing;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;novel;repaired;small molecule;tool;tumor;tumorigenesis	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	STANFORD	CA	UNITED STATES	Gerald R.

project	3R01CA204915-02S1	9654988	2018	Dissecting the Pathogenesis of Ewing Sarcoma with Integrative Genomics	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nEwing sarcoma is a rare tumor that occurs in children and young adults. While Ewing sarcoma is relatively\nrare, the biology of this disease is also relevant to non-Ewing sarcomas, and to other cancer subtypes, due to\nthe presence of the EWS/FLI translocation, the driving event in this disease. Similar translocations involving\nETS transcription factors occur in other malignancies, including prostate cancer. Thus, understanding the\nbiology of Ewing sarcoma may provide insight into many cancer types. We will investigate the role of\nsecondary genetic events in the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma. These secondary events have been\nidentified through next-generation sequencing of primary tumors and cell lines. Specifically, we will evaluate\nthe role of STAG2 in mediating epigenetic and transcriptional changes induced by the driving oncogene in\nEwing sarcoma, EWS/FLI.\nIn Aim 1, we will use genomic approaches (RNAseq, ChIPseq, WGS, etc.) to assess the mechanistic role of\nSTAG2 in the regulation of chromatin architecture, transcription, and aneuploidy in Ewing cells. In Aim 2, we\nwill study the role of STAG2 in progression, maintenance and metastasis in Ewing sarcoma, using functional\nstudies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In Aim 3, we will determine whether there\nis a synthetic lethal dependency on STAG1 when STAG2 is absent in Ewing sarcoma cells. Our central\nhypothesis is that STAG2 loss plays a key role in the epigenetic reprogramming that drives the oncogenic\nfunction of EWS/FLI.

project	3R01CA205967-03S2	9597705	2018	(PQ5) Investigation of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity of mitochondrial apoptotic sensitivity	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inter- and intra-tumoral mitochondrial heterogeneity in response to chemical perturbation in cancer Response to therapy is heterogeneous between tumors of different histology, between different tumors of the same histology, and even among different tumor cells within the same tumor. Much of the cytotoxic response to therapy in cancer is governed by the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that heterogeneity in response at all three of these levels is governed by functional and molecular heterogeneity of mitochondria. BH3 profiling provides a functional measure of how close a cell is to the threshold of apoptosis by measuring mitochondrial sensitivity to BH3 peptides, a property we also refer to as apoptotic "priming". We have previously shown, in both hematologic and solid tumors, that pretreatment baseline priming of patient tumors predicts clinical response to conventional chemotherapy. Our approach to understanding response to targeted therapies is distinct. In contrast to the ubiquitous nature of the DNA and microtubules that are the targets of conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapies attack vulnerabilities that are selectively present in certain cancer cells. To identify where these vulnerabilities exist, we briefly (less than 24 hours) expose cancer cells to drugs and measure whether the drugs increase apoptotic priming. We have shown that this approach, which we call dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), can predict death of tumor cells from targeted agents in vitro and in vivo for both hematologic and solid tumors. There are two important advantages of DBP over conventional measures of cytotoxicity. First, DBP can be applied much more efficiently to primary patient samples. Experiments measuring cytotoxicity in cancer cells often require days of culture. Because the long-term culture of primary patient samples is so unreliable, cytotoxic measurements in primary tumors are unreliable. DBP requires no more than a day of ex vivo culture since we measure well before frank cell death occurs, and we have demonstrated its predictive power in primary liquid and solid tumors. Second, there are many useful anti-cancer agents that do not cause frank cell death, but which nonetheless provoke apoptotic signaling that facilitates killing in combination regimens. Classical cytotoxic measurements do not identify these, but DBP does. We propose to study intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity based on differential response to compounds that sensitize mitochondria for apoptosis. We will focus on colon cancer tumors, as we have access to primary and PDX specimens of these tumors. Our main goals are to develop a therapeutic toolbox of potentially useful drugs, determine how best to combine these in a personalized way, and also to understand the molecular basis of the heterogeneity of mitochondrial function that underlies differences in response to these drugs.

project	3U54CA224065-01S1	9722511	2018	University of Texas PDX Development and Trial Center	Grant	SUMMARY\nOur overarching goal for the University Texas PDX Development and Trial Center (UTPDTC) is to optimize\npersonalized biomarker-based cancer therapy and identify effective targeted drugs based on the molecular\ncharacteristics of each tumor. Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly-\nannotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The\nprimary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single\nagents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs\nor combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets\nof tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused\non non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative\nbreast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other\nhistologies. Over the past 9 years, both University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDACC) and The University of\nUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) have established institution-wide efforts to generate\nnovel PDX models and perform preclinical testing. Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX\nmodels of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC,\nn=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases\nwhere there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We have characterized many tumor subtypes in our existing\nPDXs and plan to characterize many more with the ultimate goal of developing drug combinations in defined\ntumor subsets in a context that can lead to clinical trials which will validate the experimental results. We plan to\nfocus on NCI-IND agents that are primarily used by the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network. The\navailability of hundreds of PDXs of diverse histologic types and molecular profiles provides a unique opportunity\nfor synergistic interactions among the UTPDTC investigators, PDXNet, and ETCTN. Each Project will identify\nmolecular subtypes and then test with drugs targeted to putative pathways. Similar molecular subtype profiles\nwill be identified across projects and histologic classifications. This provides an opportunity to test the activity of\ndrugs targeting specific molecular pathways that may be active in several histologically distinct subtypes. Such\npan-histologic activity could greatly accelerate drug development. Our proposed studies focus on targeted\ntherapeutic agents for treatment of diseases and/or molecular subtypes that have unmet medical needs. The\nproposed studies are highly relevant to public health, as their success will lead to effective precision therapy for\ncancers, for which current therapies are ineffective.

project	3U54CA224076-01S2	9729212	2018	PDX Trial Center for Breast Cancer Therapy	Grant	Project Summary\nThe scientific premise of this Center is that breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models\nrepresent the diversity of human breast tumors, and can be feasibly utilized to test new drugs and drug\ncombinations to find therapeutic approaches that match with molecular features of various tumor types.\nThe goal of our PDX Development and Trials Center (PDTC) is to obtain preclinical data that will\nfacilitate prioritization of drugs to be tested in breast cancer clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute\n(NCI). Toward this goal, our PDTC focuses on testing drugs that are already available through the NCI\nas NCI-IND agents with the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). Scientifically,\nthis PDTC will focus on preclinical evaluation of approved and investigational drugs and drug\ncombinations in a large collection of breast PDX models representing primary and metastatic breast\ncancer. One project will screen 35 NCI-IND drugs as single agents and in combination with standard-\nof-care therapies, in >100 breast PDX models using a novel organoid system, and validate these\nresponses in PDX-bearing mice. Another project will test therapies that are predicted to target tumor-\ninitiating cell populations, with the goal of reducing chemotherapy resistance and recurrence – the major\ncause of death from breast cancer. These two synergistic research projects will be supported several\nkey Cores: a PDX Core to propagate the PDX models and run the drug studies; a Biostatistics and\nBioinformatics Core to identify molecular features of tumors that do (or do not) respond to various\ntreatments; a Pilot Projects and Trans-network Activities Core to foster exploration of new ideas within\nthe PDTC and in collaboration with the PDXNetwork (PDXNet); and an Administrative Core to facilitate\neffective communication within the PDTC and with the PDXNet. Taken together, these elements will\nconverge to reveal high-priority treatment strategies for future clinical trials in breast cancer patients.

project	5R01CA214530-02	9443610	2018	Mis-Implementation in Cancer Prevention and Control	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nBACKGROUND: Through application of existing knowledge, much of the cancer burden is preventable. State-\nlevel practitioners are in ideal positions to affect programs and policies related to cancer control. Mis-\nimplementation refers to ending effective programs and policies or continuing ineffective ones. Greater\nattention to mis-implementation should lead to use of effective interventions and more efficient expenditure of\nresources, which in the long term, will lead to positive cancer outcomes.\nGOAL: This proposal seeks to describe the extent of cancer control mis-implementation and to identify\nleverage points for addressing mis-implementation in the United States.\nAIMS AND METHODS: This is a three-phase study that takes a comprehensive approach, leading to the\nelucidation of tactics for addressing mis-implementation. Phase 1: The first aim seeks to assess the extent to\nwhich mis-implementation is occurring among state cancer control programs in public health. This initial phase\nwill involve a survey of 800 practitioners representing all states. The programs represented will span the full\ncontinuum of cancer control (from prevention to survivorship). Phase 2: Using data from Phase 1 to identify\norganizations in which mis-implementation is high or low, we will conduct eight comparative case studies to\nunderstand contextual differences. These case studies will highlight lessons learned about mis-implementation\nand identify hypothesized drivers. Phase 3: The 3rd aim seeks to build agent-based models to identify dynamic\ninteractions between individual, organizational, and contextual (external) factors driving mis-implementation.\nAgent-based modeling will be used to determine the most effective potential approaches for reducing mis-\nimplementation. We will translate and disseminate findings from Phases 1-3 to practitioners and practice-\nrelated stakeholders in order to support the reduction of mis-implementation. All study phases will rely on an\nAdvisory Group of public health practitioners and close collaboration with key practice partners.\nINNOVATIONS AND IMPACT: This study is innovative and impactful because it will: 1) be the first to refine\nand further develop reliable and valid measures of mis-implementation of public health programs; 2) bring\ntogether a strong, transdisciplinary team with significant expertise in practice-based research; 3) use agent-\nbased modeling to address cancer control implementation; and 4) use a participatory, evidence-based,\nstakeholder-driven approach that will identify key leverage points for addressing mis-implementation among\nstate public health programs. This research is expected to result in a replicable model that can significantly\nimpact mis-implementation in cancer control and can be applied to other health areas.

project	5R01CA218156-02	9527012	2018	Optimizing remotely delivered Smoking Cessation Services for Low-Income Smokers	Grant	ABSTRACT\nCigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer and many other deadly diseases, and the burden\nof tobacco use is greatest among those with limited socioeconomic resources. Although we have driven down\npopulation smoking rates, and with them, cancer rates, roughly 28% of the socioeconomically disadvantaged\nstill smoke regularly. Low-income (L-I) smokers also develop cancer at higher rates and struggle more to quit\nthan do higher-income smokers. These disparities in tobacco use and its burdens must be addressed. Highly\neffective cessation treatment services that can be delivered remotely, flexibly, and conveniently with few cost\nor logistical barriers have the potential to achieve this aim. Tobacco quitline and SmokefreeTXT services are\nsuch treatment resources with demonstrated attractiveness and reach among L-I smokers. The current\nproposal will use an efficient factorial design to evaluate 4 smoking cessation interventions with vast reach and\ndissemination potential. The target population will be N=1,408 Medicaid-eligible or uninsured smokers who\nhave recently enrolled in the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL), but who report continued smoking 4-\nmonths following engagement in standard WTQL services. These treatment non-responders will be invited to\nparticipate in an experiment that will randomize them to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following 4 factors in a\n2X2X2X2 design: WTQL counseling intensity (1 session vs. 4 sessions), medication intensity (2-week nicotine\npatch monotherapy vs. 4-week nicotine patch and lozenge combination therapy), a supportive text messaging\nprogram (SmokefreeTXT vs. none), and financial incentives (rewards of up to $150 for treatment engagement\nvs. no treatment incentives). The primary outcome will be 26-week biochemically confirmed point-prevalence\nabstinence. Analyses will examine the main and interactive effects of these 4 treatment components on 26-\nweek and secondary abstinence outcomes to identify the components and combinations of components that\nsignificantly enhance success in quitting in this high-risk population. This experiment will identify especially\neffective combinations of highly scalable interventions of modest cost and few barriers that could be\ndisseminated nationally to reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking cessation among those seeking to\nquit. Additional analyses will: compare intervention components and promising component combinations in\nterms of cost-effectiveness, examine whether or not treatment engagement differs across component\ncombinations, examine baseline variables that may moderate treatment response, and identify mediators of\ntreatment effects on abstinence outcomes. Because delivery of the study interventions can be centralized\nthrough established and efficient services (WTQL and SmokefreeTXT), the potential for both scalable\ndissemination and cost-effectiveness of the interventions tested is great. The proposed research will help\nidentify ways to reduce tobacco cessation disparities in L-I smokers who have tried to quit smoking but\nrelapsed and may benefit from improved assistance.

project	5R01CA221290-02	9527109	2018	Metabolic reprogramming of Tregs in tumor immunity	Grant	Program Description/Abstract\nMetabolic reprogramming is a fundamental process underlying the growth of cancer cells and activated\nlymphocytes. These rapidly dividing cells markedly upregulate aerobic glycolysis (Warburg metabolism) and\nalso reprogram mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to support the energy and growth\ndemands. Moreover, mTOR signaling is a central regulator of anabolic metabolism in cancer cells and\nlymphocytes. While Warburg and mitochondrial metabolism and mTOR signaling are being actively studied, we\nare just beginning to appreciate the involvement of other biosynthetic programs such as de novo lipid synthesis\n(lipogenesis). Emerging evidence highlights that cancer immunotherapy is a powerful tool to combat cancers,\nbut immune tolerance mediated by immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) represents a major obstacle\nfor effective anti-tumor immunity. Although mTOR was generally considered a crucial negative regulator of\nTregs, our genetic studies have revealed that mTORC1 is a pivotal positive determinant of Treg function by\nlinking immune signals to the lipogenic program. In our preliminary studies, disruption of the lipogenic program\nin Tregs rendered the mice to reject tumor cells but did not cause obvious autoimmune disorders under steady\nstate. We hypothesize that lipogenic program contributes to Treg suppressive activity in the tumor\nmicroenvironment, which could represent a novel target for cancer immunotherapy. We will test this hypothesis\nby establishing the roles of Treg lipogenic programs in tumor immunity, and determining the metabolic and\nsignaling basis whereby lipogenesis programs Treg functions. We predict these studies will establish a new\nparadigm on our understanding of lipogenic program in Tregs and how this impinges upon tumor immunity.\nInsights gained from this project will likely lead to innovative strategies on cancer immunotherapy by\ncapitalizing on metabolic reprogramming of Tregs.

project	5R21CA215968-02	9527063	2018	Investigating developmental Hox programs as determinants of sarcomagenesis	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nHijacking of normal developmental programs is a common mechanism of tumorigenesis and deregulation\nof developmental HOX programs, in particular, contributes to the pathogenesis of leukemia, as well as\nsome solid tumors. We recently discovered that HOX gene expression is highly deregulated in Ewing\nsarcoma, an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor that has a peak incidence in adolescence. Specifically,\nthe posterior HOX genes, HOXD10, HOXD11 and HOXD13, are over-expressed compared to other\nnormal and malignant tissues, and down-regulation of HOXD13 in Ewing sarcoma cell lines results in a\ndramatic decrease in tumorigenicity. The expression of all Hox genes normally becomes restricted to\ndistinct regions of the developing musculoskeletal (MSK) system during embryonic development, with the\nposterior genes becoming restricted to the lumbosacral vertebrae, pelvis and developing forelimb and\nhindlimb – the dominant sites of Ewing sarcoma presentation clinically. Recent work from the Wellik\nlaboratory has shown that Hox-expressing cells arise as mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells (MSCs)\nduring embryonic development and persist as regionally-restricted MSCs through postnatal and adult\nstages. MSCs have been implicated as putative cells of origin for Ewing sarcoma, but the precise identity\nof the target cells, the molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation and a clear explanation of the\nregion-specific etiology of this tumor type remain poorly understood. Important for this application, the\nLawlor lab has shown that ectopic expression of the Ewing sarcoma driver oncogene, EWS/FLI1, in bulk\npopulations of MSCs initiates tumorigenesis and disrupts HOX gene expression as a result of epigenetic\nderegulation. These two key findings lead us to the novel hypothesis that EWS/FLI1-dependent disruption\nof the posterior HOX program in MSCs where these genes are developmentally and regionally expressed\n(i.e. the posterior skeleton) is central to Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis. We will determine the efficiency\nand latency of EWS/FLI1-induced tumor formation in Hox-expressing MSCs that are isolated from different\nanatomic sites and test the hypothesis that oncogenic transformation occurs more readily in MSC\npopulations where restricted, posterior Hox gene expression has been established. We will use\nHoxa11eGFP reporter mice to monitor ectopic induction of the posterior Hox program in transduced cells\nand their resultant tumors. Use of MSCs from control and Hox mutant mouse lines will allow us to\ndetermine if posterior Hox genes are functionally required for the transformation process in vivo as our in\nvitro data suggest. With the biochemical, molecular and in vivo genetic tools the two labs have developed,\nsuccessful demonstration of this novel hypothesis during this funding period will provide the basis for\nfuture highly impactful and mechanistic dissection of the etiology of Ewing's sarcoma, including a\nmolecular basis for understanding the regional specificity of this tumor in vivo.

project	1P50CA244289-01	9868790	2019	Building Research in Implementation and Dissemination to close Gaps and achieve Equity in Cancer Control (BRIDGE-C2) Center	Grant	OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe Building Research in Implementation and Dissemination to close Gaps and achieve Equity in Cancer\nControl (BRIDGE-C2) Center will take on the grand challenge of advancing implementation science to\nimprove cancer screening and prevention in underserved populations. This work is urgently needed\nbecause cancer screening and prevention disparities exist with regard to delivery of evidence-based\ninterventions (EBIs). Effective strategies to improve implementation of EBIs in primary care community health\ncenters (CHCs) that can eliminate these disparities are not known or poorly understood. Implementation\nscience can contribute new knowledge that will transform CHCs' ability to serve the nation's most vulnerable\npopulations. The BRIDGE-C2 Center will: 1) create a sustainable infrastructure for developing, conducting, and\ncontinuously evaluating implementation strategies that enhance primary care's ability to equitably deliver\nevidence-based cancer screening and prevention interventions to all people, emphasizing closing care gaps\nfor vulnerable populations; 2) build capacity and training opportunities, and engage a multi-disciplinary team of\nimplementation science and methods experts, to facilitate the development of innovative approaches relevant\nto our grand challenge; and 3) identify strategies to improve implementation of cancer screening and\nprevention EBIs in primary care, and conduct research / develop pragmatic methods to tailor, enhance, and\nsupport the adoption and sustainability of these strategies. We will build on the strong established partnerships\nbetween researchers at Oregon Health & Science (OHSU) primary care, the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute,\nand the OCHIN Implementation Laboratory (a well-established national network of >500 CHCs that share an\nelectronic health record through the OCHIN Practice-Based Research Network). The BRIDGE-C2 Center will\nconduct pilot studies that develop and test strategies to improve implementation of EBIs, rapidly scale up\nsuccessful pilots to conduct large scale pragmatic trials, and widely disseminate effective innovations to\nprimary care practices caring for underserved populations. Woven throughout these activities will be the\nCenter's focus on mentoring and training early career implementation scientists and leveraging collaborations\nto increase implementation science capacity. The Center's Administrative Core will serve as the nucleus that\nbridges the Research Program and Implementation Laboratory, providing support for research activities,\nleadership, governance, investigator development, dissemination, evaluation, and a connection to the national\nISCCC network. Our first two research pilots aim to improve cervical cancer screening and follow-up care and\ntobacco cessation. Our first two methods pilots will create novel capabilities to predict needed implementation\nsupport based on provider and practice characteristics. We will spread our discoveries and create mechanisms\nfor widely disseminating our findings and innovations to scientific, professional, and community networks to\nincrease implementation of cancer screening and prevention EBIs and decrease health disparities.

project	1P50CA244431-01	9869208	2019	Washington University Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Component\nBackground and vision. As an Advanced Center, the vision of the Washington University Implementation\nScience Center for Cancer Control (WU-ISCCC) is to conduct implementation research to help eliminate\ncancer disparities in rural and other disadvantaged communities.\nGoal. The overall goal of the WU-ISCCC is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for rapid-cycle\nimplementation research to increase the reach, external validity, and sustainability of effective cancer control\ninterventions. Our goal and Center activities capture three distinct features: (1) a focus on elimination of cancer\ndisparities; (2) the need for rapid-cycle studies; and (3) the use of systems science approaches to enhance\nmethods and outcomes in implementation science.\nSetting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration,\ncatalyzes new ideas, and ensures support for research that finds solutions for complex implementation\nchallenges in real-world settings with high cancer disparities (rural and urban counties in Missouri and Illinois).\nSubstantial matching contributions from Washington University will allow us to strategically invest in new ideas.\nAims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) advance the field of implementation science in cancer control\nby conducting innovative and impactful research; (2) expand an exceptional, diverse team of implementation\nscience investigators and stakeholders; (3) organize and integrate Center components to facilitate\ntransdisciplinary team science; (4) develop an Implementation Laboratory (known as the “Innovation\nIncubator”) to serve as a conduit for innovative, rapid-cycle, and impactful research; and (5) address cancer\ndisparities by making it as easy as possible for disadvantaged populations to encounter, use, and benefit from\nevidence-based interventions.\nInnovations and impact. The WU-ISCCC will be innovative and provide a significant return on the scientific\ninvestment. First, our Center has distinctive features that include a combined focus on cancer disparities, the\napplication of strategies to conduct rapid-cycle studies, and the use of systems science approaches. Second,\nwe have assembled a diverse, world class team with strong linkages to multiple practice settings that will be\ncritical parts of our Innovation Incubator. Third, we will engage investigators from different disciplines and\ninvest in the development of early career scholars as cancer implementation scientists. Fourth, we will\nstrategically and creatively disseminate products in ways that will benefit researchers, practitioners, and\ncommunity members. Fifth, we have developed a focused strategy for collective integration of our projects,\ncores, and units to ensure that the WU-ISCCC impact is greater than the sum of its individual parts. In\nsummary, the WU-ISCCC will be a national resource for furthering implementation science for eliminating\ncancer disparities.

project	1P50CA244432-01	9869213	2019	Optimizing Implementation in Cancer Control: OPTICC	Grant	OVERALL SUMMARY\nThe mission of the OPTICC (Optimizing Implementation in Cancer Control) Center is to improve cancer outcomes\nby supporting optimized implementation of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) in cancer control. Optimized\nimplementation occurs when: (1) the strategies employed to implement EBIs address the key barriers to\nimplementation that are active in the specific settings in which implementation occurs, and (2) those strategies\nreflect the best possible methods for addressing the barriers. Despite two decades of progress in implementation\nscience (IS), practical tools and guidance to support optimized EBI implementation are lacking; as a result,\nstrategies are often mismatched to barriers and are often not optimized for effectiveness, efficiency, or fit with local\nresources. The result is suboptimal implementation in the form of lost time, effort, and resources and, ultimately,\npoorer cancer outcomes. The OPTICC Center will advance IS and, in turn, improve EBI implementation in cancer\ncontrol by developing, testing, and refining innovative methods for optimizing EBI implementation. The OPTICC\nCenter is a strategic collaboration of the University of Washington (UW), Kaiser Permanente Washington Health\nResearch Institute (KPWHRI), and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three cores will\nsupport its work. The Administrative Core will promote multidisciplinary collaboration, research excellence, and\nmethodological innovation. It will also lead Center outreach and dissemination efforts, evaluate Center impact, and\ncoordinate Center activities. The Research Program Core will conduct innovative implementation studies, method\nand measurement studies, and small pilot studies that advance the Center’s “grand challenge” IS theme of\noptimizing EBI implementation. A three-stage approach to optimizing EBI implementation will be taken—identify\nand prioritize barriers, match strategies, and test strategies—with measurement development spanning all three\nstages. The Implementation Laboratory Core will establish and coordinate a network of diverse clinical and\ncommunity sites to conduct “in vivo” IS studies, implement cancer control EBIs, and shape the Center’s research\nagenda. The Center’s initial studies will focus on optimizing implementation of screening EBIs for cervical,\ncolorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer. However, the methods for optimizing EBI implementation that the Center\nwill develop, test, and refine can be applied broadly across the cancer care continuum, for a wide range of cancers,\nto answer a wide range of IS questions.

project	1P50CA244433-01	9869339	2019	The Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity	Grant	Abstract - Overall\nAfter decades of research developing and testing interventions for cancer control, we have the evidence\nneeded to prevent more than half of all cancers. The impact of these strategies on cancer outcomes is\nsignificant for both the general population and low income and under-represented groups that bear a\ndisproportionate share of preventable cancer burden, but evidence-based interventions have not been\nuniformly used across population groups. Gaps in implementation of the evidence base can be seen for nearly\nall known cancer prevention and early detection strategies. As a result, we incur substantial avoidable cancer\nmorbidity and mortality and tolerate preventable inequities.\nThe Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity (ISCCCE) will create an ecosystem for robust\nimplementation science (IS) related to cancer prevention and control in Massachusetts community health\ncenters (CHCs) and their local communities. Our theme, improving community health by integrating health\nequity and implementation science for evidence-based cancer control, reflects our critical mass of expertise in\ncancer disparities, IS, and community-based cancer prevention and control research. Our “grand challenge”\nis to address the inequitable implementation and limited scale of evidence-based interventions by developing\nand testing implementation strategies aimed at narrowing health inequities and by advancing methods that\ncarefully consider the low-resource, complex nature of CHCs where adaptation and cost-effective solutions are\nneeded most. The implementation studies we conduct will address inequities within CHC clinical practice as\nwell as prevention interventions that link to community resources and assets. Our I-Lab is comprised of 31\nCHCs who are members of the Mass League of Community Health Centers and use a common EHR vendor-\nneutral population management system that has extensive reporting capability within and across CHCs, which\nwill allow us to study implementation outcomes in different geographic settings across the state using common\nmeasures. Given that achieving equity in community health requires clinical, community, and policy-level\ninterventions, our pilots will also examine how to expand the impact and sustainability of CHCs’ cancer\nprevention efforts through effective partnerships in community and policy settings. Our Network Unit connects\nus directly with other Moonshot IS initiatives and national community health leadership, and expands\nopportunities for collaboration and synergy, building IS capacity in our own institutions and across the nation.

project	1P50CA244688-01	9870154	2019	Pragmatic Implementation Science Approaches to Assess and Enhance Value of Cancer Prevention and Control in Rural Primary Care	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract – Overall\nThe theme of our proposed Implementation Science Center is “Pragmatic implementation science approaches\nto assess and enhance the value of cancer prevention and control in rural primary care.” We will apply and\nadvance frameworks, pragmatic methods, and measures related to cost, benefits, and value that are rigorous,\nbut also generalizable across rural primary care settings that are often struggling with low resources, and a\nhigh need population. These models and methods will be used to guide selection and implementation of\nevidence-based programs for cancer prevention and control (CPC). We will initially focus on lung cancer\nscreening in rural primary care settings, first in Colorado and then nationally through collaboration with a well-\nestablished primary care network (i.e., National Research Network).\nOur overarching framework will be our enhanced RE-AIM/PRISM model, which is an extension of the broadly\nused Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework with the addition of\ncontextual factors (e.g., Intervention characteristics, implementation and sustainability infrastructure). It will\nserve as the basis to develop and test innovative assessments of costs, benefits, and value from the\nperspective of different stakeholders to understand and guide implementation. We will meaningfully engage\nwith and include the perspectives of patients, providers, and staff stakeholders in all our studies. Our pilot\nImplementation Study will adapt, implement, and evaluate strategies using stakeholder-engaged approaches\nto value to guide the implementation of shared decision-making and smoking cessation related to lung cancer\nscreening.\nOur Methods Unit will refine and evaluate our pragmatic cost assessment methods to determine\nimplementation/replication costs from the perspective(s) of patients, providers, and delivery staff and then\ndevelop and pilot test brief survey measures of preferences regarding the relative benefit of different RE-AIM\noutcomes.

The\nAdministrative Core will manage the Center, ensure that iDAPT is engaged with “real world” clinical partners,\npatients, and families, is well-networked with the Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control\nconsortium, and engage in a comprehensive evaluation of Center activities and milestones. The Research\nProgram will include an Implementation Studies Unit with an initial 2-year pilot study using adaptable\ntechnology to enhance shared decision-making in survivorship care planning for survivors of breast cancer.\nThe Research Program also includes a Methods Unit with an initial innovation pilot study to test the feasibility\nof natural language processing to measure communication patterns pre-implementation and to monitor\nimplementation fidelity of programs designed to enhance within-team and clinical team-to-patient electronic\ncommunication. The Research Program is expected to complete 8 to 10 pilot studies. In order to foster\nresearch aligned with iDAPT’s theme, we will build and sustain iDAPT’s Implementation Laboratory which\nincorporates capacity building and infrastructure for testing the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and\nreal time deployment of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The laboratory\nincludes primary care and oncology clinics in our local “Hubs” in southern Appalachia (North Carolina) and the\nnortheast (Massachusetts) and “Spokes” including over 900 community-based oncology clinics in the NCIs\nNational Community Oncology Research Program and nationwide Veteran’s Administration clinics. iDAPTs\nleadership is a multi-disciplinary team of experts with extensive experience in cancer-focused implementation\nscience, behavioral science, computer engineering and computer science, clinical informatics, formative\nqualitative methods, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The iDAPT Developing Center will be considered\nsuccessful if we achieve the following outcomes: (1) a robust, collaborative Implementation Laboratory with\npartners who are knowledgeable and experienced with implementation science in cancer control; (2)\ncompletion of 8 to 10 pilot projects related to iDAPTs emerging theme; (3) pilot grantees and lab partners are\nprepared to lead investigator initiated studies as a result of capacity building and pilot grant experiences; (4)\njunior faculty and underrepresented persons are engaged in all Center activities; (5) The field of\nimplementation science in cancer control is advanced aligned within iDAPT’s emerging theme; and (6) iDAPT\nis part of a new network of ISCCCs who collectively build the field of implementation science in cancer control.

project	1U01CA232361-01A1	9839146	2019	Defining and overcoming intrinsic T cell dysfunction to enable pediatric immunotherapy	Grant	Project Summary and Abstract\nImmune therapy for cancer has risen to prominence by successfully overcoming chemotherapy\nresistance. One of the most successful therapies is chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR) that\ntarget the CD19 protein on the surface of leukemia. Landmark clinical trials led by our group\ndemonstrated unparalleled efficacy in relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n(ALL), with complete remission rates in excess of 80%, resulting in the first ever FDA approval\nof a gene modified cell therapy (Kymriah, tisagenlecleucel). There is a great need to develop\nCAR therapies for other pediatric cancers, and we face many challenges to achieve the same\nlevel of success in solid tumors and lymphoma.\nPrimary among these challenges is the difficulty in collecting healthy T cells from pediatric\ncancer patients. Our experience not only treating the most children in the world with CAR\ntherapy but also getting the most referrals gave us insight into the difficulty of getting healthy T\ncells from children with cancer. We have identified two main problems: dysfunction in T cells\nfrom children with solid tumors present at diagnosis and progressive difficulty getting functional\nT cells after intensive chemotherapy. As we have investigated these problems, we learned how\nfortunate we were with pediatric ALL, a patient group that has proven to have T cells uniquely\nwell preserved for CAR therapy generation.\nThis project seeks to identify the mechanisms of dysfunction in T cells from pediatric cancer\npatients both before and after chemotherapy, and reverse them to enable the generation of\nhighly active CAR T cell therapies for cancers other than ALL. Our preliminary data indicates\nthat Naïve T cells are the key starting material for successful CAR T cell generation in\npediatrics, and that in their absence preserving Naïve-like function during CAR manufacture can\nsubstitute. Metabolic pathways are key in the transitions from Naïve to memory and effector\nstates, and these feed into the energy reserve of a T cell as measured by its mitochondrial\npotential. Our research plan centers on manipulating metabolic pathways and restoring\nmitochondrial respiratory capacity to T cells from pediatric cancer patients. This will enable the\nhigh level of proliferative capacity required for effective CAR therapy as we develop new targets\nwithin the Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery and Development Network. Our work will support\nthe discovery efforts of the PI-DDN by developing the specialized T cell manufacturing required\nfor these difficult to treat cancers.

project	1U01CA232795-01A1	9845571	2019	Implementing the moon: Getting genomic testing to the public	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nGenetics reports on 22 areas of clinical practice guidelines on how to use genetic tests, based on data that\nclinical outcomes are enhanced or improved by regular use. Current practice guidelines from ACMG provide\nreferral indications for cancer predisposition assessment. Identifying patients with high genetic risk for breast,\novary, colon, or other cancers has important clinical ramifications for an individual's healthcare, but genetic risk\nif often not identified because of testing barriers at several levels. Barriers at the provider level include\ninadequacies in risk recognition, patient referrals and availability of genetic professionals to provide counseling\nin a traditional testing paradigm. Barriers at the level of the patient include poor understanding of the\navailability and benefits of testing and inadequate access to testing services. How to best implement\nappropriate genomic testing and follow-up care into an operating healthcare system is not known. Issues of\ncommunication, clinical flow, reportable actions, and transmission of information and support are of critical\nimportance, and must change and grow to accommodate the new information contained within genomic\ntesting. Studies to date of the implementation process have been conducted in high resourced facilities, under\noptimal conditions, often not at the system level. Aims include:\n1. Compare the efficacy and implementation of two strategies for identifying members of a primary care clinic's\npopulation who have a family or personal history of cancer and offering high-risk individuals to obtain genetic\ntesting for cancer susceptibility mutations in a randomized trial. The two methods are: 1) Point of Care (POC)\napproach: A tablet-based screening for family/personal history of cancer will be offered to all patients aged 25-\n65 coming in for a routine appointment at the clinic. 2) Direct Patient Engagement (DPE): Letters will be sent to\nall individuals aged 25-65 in a clinic's population, inviting them to visit a web site for screening for family\n/personal history of cancer. In both strategies, those determined to be high-risk will receive online education\nabout genetic testing and an invitation to obtain such testing through a web-based platform. Outcomes will be\nthe fraction of the active clinic patient population that completes screening and the fraction of the active clinic\npatient population that undergoes testing.\n2. Identify changes, problems, and inefficiencies in clinical flow and interactions during and after the\nimplementation of genomic testing for cancer risk across primary care clinics.\n3. Evaluate the effects of two methods of implementation of genomic screening for cancer risk on patient,\nprovider, and health system leader reports of benefits and harms, satisfaction, perceived quality of care,\nincluding across gender, racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and genetic literacy divides.\n4. Evaluate the value (cost-effectiveness) and affordability (budget impact) of each screening strategy.

project	1U01CA232829-01A1	9848671	2019	Improving identification and healthcare for patients with Inherited Cancer Syndromes: Evidence-based EMR implementation using a web-based computer platform	Grant	Project Summary\nFrom the earliest recognition of families with a high rate of cancer over 100 years ago, researchers have been\nfocused on the genetic underpinnings of inherited cancers; however, identification remains a significant\nchallenge due to persistent barriers across patient, provider and health system stakeholders, despite recent\nadvances in the development of electronic medical records (EMR) and risk prediction tools that use family\nhealth history (FHH) information. Innovations in bioinformatic technology hold great promise in overcoming\nmany of these barriers, particularly with the development of FHH applications that collect and analyze family\ndata, and SMART-on-FHIR capabilities that can integrate third party apps with the EMR. MeTree, a patient\nfacing risk assessment platform for 23 hereditary cancer syndromes with integrated education and evidence-\nbased clinical decision support, is one such platform that served as the backbone of the Implementing\nGenomics in Practice (IGNITE) network's FHH clinical utility study, where it demonstrated improvements in the\nidentification of those at risk, yet, also highlighted ongoing challenges particularly around undergoing genetic\ncounseling and testing, and awareness of risk. We submit that these barriers can be overcome and that we\ncan significantly improve identification and management of those at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes by\nbringing together a single clinical care platform that contains: a patient-facing risk assessment program\nintegrated into the EMR, automated risk calculation with clinical decision support for patients and physicians for\nmultiple hereditary cancer syndromes, systematic assessment of risk across a variety of clinic settings,\nguidance and education on family health history, genomics, risk management, and cascade screening, and an\nimplementation sciences framework to allow us to build a novel and scalable clinical care paradigm for\nhereditary cancer risk assessment and risk management. To do this we will: 1) deploy a care delivery model\nthat will facilitate systematic risk assessment for hereditary cancers in diverse clinical environments\n(in primary care and cancer care clinics at two different medical centers) in a randomized controlled trial of\n4000 patients; 2) improve access to genetic healthcare providers for participants at risk for hereditary\ncancer syndromes by deploying the care delivery model in the cancer genetic counseling clinics in a\nrandomized controlled trial of 300 patients; and 3) explore the feasibility of our care delivery model to\nimprove family engagement for cancer risk assessment for patients who are found to have cancer gene\nvariants or strong family histories of cancer.\nWiesner GL and Orlando LA 1	Academic Medical Centers;Appointment;Awareness;Bioinformatics;Cancer Family;Caring;Clinic;Clinical;Clinics and Hospitals;Collection;Communities;Computerized Medical Record;Computers;Counseling;Coupled;Data;Development;Education;Elements;Enrollment;Environment;Family;Family Cancer History;Family health status;Family member;Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources;Genetic;Genetic Counseling;Genetic Medicine;Genetic screening method;Genomics;Geography;Grant;Health;Health Personnel;Health system;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm;Hereditary Neoplastic Syndromes;High Prevalence;Improve Access;Individual;Informatics;Inherited;Interview;Life;Link;Low income;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical;Medical center;Modernization;Oncogenes;Online Systems;Participant;Pathogenicity;Patient Education;Patients;Perception;Physicians;Preventive therapy;Primary Health Care;Provider;Public Health;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recording of previous events;Research Personnel;Resources;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Management;Savings;Service delivery model;Specialist;Structure;Surveys;Syndrome;System;Technology;Telecommunications;Telephone;Testing;Time;Training;Translating;Underserved Population;Universities;Variant;Vertebral column;Wait Time;base;biomedical informatics;cancer care;cancer genetics;cancer risk;clinical care;clinical decision support;evidence base;evidence based guidelines;flexibility;genetic variant;health record;high risk;implementation science;improved;innovation;novel;patient engagement;pressure;programs;screening;support tools;tool;treatment as usual	VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER	NASHVILLE	TN	UNITED STATES	Lori Ann Orlando,GEORGIA L WIESNER	DCTD	Nonniekaye F Shelburne	5339027	5339027	2019-09-17T04:00:00Z	2019-09-17T04:00:00Z	2024-08-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-19-017	Moonshot
project	1U01CA232836-01A1	9848961	2019	Randomized trial of universal vs. guideline-directed germline testing among young adults with cancer	Grant	Cancer is the leading nontraumatic cause of death among young adults. In individuals under age 40, cancer\nhas a distinct biology and often has an underlying genetic etiology. However, consensus guidelines driven by\nphenotypic characteristics fail to identify many young adult patients with inherited genetic risk, in part due to\ntheir complexity and to lack of data on mutation frequency. We likely vastly underestimate the frequency and\nspectrum of germline susceptibility in young adults with cancer, knowledge of which would have far-reaching\nimplications both for their treatment and follow-up care and for the diagnosis and management of relatives.\nThus, better strategies for diagnosing inherited risk among young adults with cancer are needed. Further,\ngenetic testing rates among relatives of those identified with inherited cancer risk range from 50-60%;\ninterventions to overcome the barriers that patients and relatives face, so they can take appropriate screening\nand risk-reducing measures, must be developed and tested. Finally, there is a critical need to integrate genetic\nevaluation and test results into the electronic medical record (EMR) to facilitate tailored clinical decision\nsupport for both clinicians and patients. The present proposal seeks to overcome the limitations of current data\nand models of care through two Specific Aims. First, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial among 1421\nyoung adults with cancer, one-third of whom will be members of racial or ethnic minorities or medically\nunderserved groups, to compare rates of ascertainment of genetic risk between guideline-driven, phenotype-\ndirected genetic testing (current standard of care) and universal cancer panel genetic testing. Working with the\nPenn Medicine Nudge Unit and Information Services, we will develop EMR-based algorithms for automatic\npatient referral and clinical decision support, driven by discrete genetic test results ported into the EMR via\nHL7, that will include ‘active choice’ nudges, direct-to-patient alerts, and physician dashboards that minimize\nphysician burden. We will compare adherence to screening recommendations among participants to that\namong historical controls. Second, we will compare the impact of the two up-front testing strategies among\npatients, enhanced by a novel strategy of direct team outreach to at-risk relatives, on ascertainment of genetic\nrisk among family members. We also will conduct qualitative interviews with a diverse sample of patients,\nrelatives, and family groups to describe the critical interactions that facilitate or impede communication about\nrisk and cascade testing within families and to explore the acceptability of direct clinical team outreach to at-\nrisk relatives. The proposed study promises to immediately alter national standards of care and payer policies\nby identifying the preferred approach to evaluating young adult cancer patients for genetic risk through a\nrigorous randomized trial, while measuring ascertainment among both patients and their relatives. In addition,\nbeyond its potential to change standards of care, the study will generate shareable EMR-based code,\nalgorithms, and models that will further enhance the sustainability of the proposed approach.

project	1U01CA233085-01A1	9869478	2019	Reprograming the tumor microenvironment to overcome multiple primary and acquired immune resistance mechanisms in ovarian cancer	Grant	The goal of our studies is to generate robust and long-lasting tumor-specific T cell responses for durable\ntumor regression in patients with chemotherapy-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Although\nimmunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive T cell therapy, or oncolytic viruses has generated\nremarkable results in several other tumor types, long-term tumor control has been infrequent in EOC patients.\nStudies by our group have identified key stumbling blocks underpinning the limited efficacy of immunotherapy\nin EOC, which include: (i) insufficient expansion of tumor-specific T cells, (ii) tumor-derived CXCL12 production\nthat recruits Tregs and MDSC within tumors, (iii) expression of PD1 and LAG3 marking severely dysfunctional\ntumor infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), (iv) compensatory upregulation of LAG3 upon blockade of PD1 and\nvice-versa, and (v) disorganized and tortuous tumor vasculature lacking adequate flow dynamics to support\ntrafficking of anti-tumor T cells. While combinatorial immunotherapy strategies have the potential to overcome\nthese immune resistance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME), they are often associated with\nunacceptably high rates of toxicities in patients. Our proposal addresses these stumbling blocks using\ninnovative, clinically-translatable strategies to reprogram the TME and to identify mechanisms that drive or\nhinder T cell trafficking into ovarian tumors.\n We previously demonstrated blockade of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in the ovarian TME by intraperitoneal\ndelivery of an oncolytic vaccinia virus expressing a CXCR4 antagonist (OV-CXCR4-Fc) reduced intratumoral\naccumulation of immunosuppressive mediators and stimulated spontaneous antitumor immunity to\nendogenous tumor antigens. OV-CXCR4-Fc also improved T cell trafficking. We will build on the multifaceted\nantitumor activity of OV-CXCR4-Fc by further “arming” with antagonists of PD1 and LAG3, the two co-inhibitory\nreceptors we have shown mark severely dysfunctional TILs in EOC patients. In addition, we plan to uncover\nthe molecular mechanisms by which OV-CXCR4-Fc enhances T cell migration and trafficking to overcome the\novarian tumor “vascular checkpoint”. We hypothesize that in vivo tumor destruction by OV engineered to\nexpress the CXCR4 antagonist and PD1/LAG3 inhibitors (OV-CXCR4-Fc-PD1/LAG3) will limit dampening of\nthe immune response in the TME and induce a molecular signature that promotes trafficking and homing of\ntumor-specific T cells. To test our hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims:\n Aim 1. Determine the therapeutic synergy of arming OV-CXCR4-Fc with PD1/LAG3 inhibitors.\n Aim 2. Determine the mechanism by which OV-CXCR4-Fc promotes T cell trafficking in murine and human\n ovarian tumors.\n Aim 3. To manufacture and certify a Master Viral Bank (MVB) and Final Product (FP) of OV-CXCR4-Fc for\n IND qualification.

project	1U01CA233096-01A1	9868724	2019	Cytokine immunotherapies for melanoma	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nImmunotherapies for cancer, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), have exhibited impressive efficacy for\na broad spectrum of cancers, including melanoma. However, despite their potential to produce dramatic\ntreatment responses, ICI have proven to be ineffective for most patients and tumor types. Consequently, there\nremains a need for new immunotherapies that are effective in patients who are resistant or non-responsive to\ncurrent ICI. To this end, immune cytokines have potent immunostimulatory activities that make them attractive\npotential therapeutics. Compared to the effect of ICI to “tune” existing immune responses, cytokines can tap into\npowerful programs that can effectively “reprogram” immune cells and control their activation, differentiation, and\nproliferation. Among cytokines, Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is an appealing immunotherapeutic candidate given its\nability to stimulate both adaptive and innate immunity through CD8+ T and NK cells, respectively. However, the\nactivity of IL-18 is limited by an endogenous decoy receptor, IL-18BP, which is induced as part of a negative\nfeedback loop by interferon gamma activity, reminiscient of the regulation of the PD-1:PD-L1 axis and suggesting\nthat it may represent a “soluble immune checkpoint” in cancer. Using directed evolution, the Ring lab has created\nan engineered version of IL-18 that is fully capable of activating the IL-18 receptor, but impervious to inhibition\nby IL-18BP. This decoy resistant IL-18 (DR-18) is active as a mono-immunotherapy in preclinical mouse models,\nwhere it can induce complete and durable tumor regressions. DR-18 also synergizes with ICI (anti-PD-1) therapy\nand is associated with high cure rates and limited toxicity in this setting. Notably, DR-18 is also effective for the\ntreatment of MHC class I deficient murine tumors, which are resistant to ICI treatment, consistent with the ability\nof IL-18 to also activate anti-tumor activity of NK cells. In order to better understand the mechanism of DR-18\nimmunotherapy and enable its translation into the clinic, we propose to leverage a comprehensive series of\nsophisticated, genetically-defined syngeneic mouse models of melanoma called YUMM and YUMMER that we\nhave developed. We propose to more comprehensively evaluate our hypothesis that bypass of the IL-18BP\ncheckpoint by DR-18 will enable responses in ICI-resistant tumors in two Aims: 1) Evaluation and optimization\nof DR-18 therapy in melanoma, and 2) Development of DR-18 for the treatment of ICI-resistant tumors. We will\nutilize techniques including single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitiative pathology to better characterize DR-18\nresponses in the tumor microenvironment over time.

project	1U01CA243688-01	9848695	2019	The AYA-RISE Intervention: Risk Information and Screening Education for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Predisposition Syndromes	Grant	ABSTRACT\nGrowing evidence shows that hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of cancer patients, with\nheightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults\n(AYAs). Genetic counseling is therefore recommended for all AYAs with new cancer diagnoses, for whom\nresults can lead to future cancer screening, risk-reducing surgeries, and reproductive counseling. Testing can\nalso have a domino effect, identifying other affected relatives and reducing cancer risk in entire families.\nAYAs require unique considerations when communicating cancer risk due to wide variability in developmental\nand emotional maturity. Genetic counseling necessitates complex cognitive and affective processing from\nAYAs, ideally resulting in an active ownership of their condition and a commitment to life-long health behavior\nchange. This tall order comes as AYAs are forming their identity, gaining parental independence, and\nconsidering future childbearing – often under the shadow of enormous personal or family losses from cancer.\nThese factors complicate AYAs' ability to weigh tradeoffs of genetic testing and screening recommendations –\nsometimes with tragic consequences. Unfortunately, there have been few if any efforts to optimize cancer risk\ncommunication and decision-making for AYAs. The goal of this project is to develop, implement and test\nan AYA-specific intervention for cancer risk communication and decision-making.\nOur interdisciplinary team of experts in health communication, cancer genetics, oncology, and pediatric\npsychology from 4 major Cancer Risk Programs will develop AYA-RISE (Risk Information and Screening\nEducation), a web-based intervention comprised of (1) an interactive chatbot designed to communicate\ngenetic information to AYAs in developmentally appropriate ways; and (2) an individualized patient portal,\nserving as an educational resource and longitudinal repository for cancer risk and screening information.\nIterative user testing with qualitative feedback from AYAs will be used to optimize the program prior to\nconducting a type I hybrid implementation effectiveness trial of AYA-RISE. Our aims are:\nAim 1: To refine and pilot AYA-RISE, adapting implementation to ensure feasibility and acceptability\namong AYAs with cancer risk syndromes, their family members, and providers.\nAim 2: To test AYA-RISE among AYAs with cancer predisposition syndromes at 4 centers to determine\nimpact on (1) patient knowledge of cancer risk and recommended screening; (2) psychological\ndistress; (3) patient ownership of information; and (4) follow-up for recommended care.\nAim 3: To evaluate implementation outcomes of AYA-RISE, including ways that AYAs use the chatbot\nand patient portal, and AYA, family, and provider experiences, to facilitate future dissemination.\nIf successful, this study will yield a scalable, patient- and family-centered intervention to improve cancer risk\ncommunication and decision-making for AYAs and their families, with an ultimate goal of cancer risk reduction.

project	1U01CA244291-01	9868844	2019	Optimizing myeloma-specific immunity after autologous stem cell transplantation	Grant	Abstract\nMultiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy and despite improved patient\noutcomes in the era of novel agents, it remains largely incurable. Clinical studies show that autologous stem cell\ntransplantation (ASCT) remains an efficacious consolidation treatment for eligible patients and a subset of\ntransplant recipients achieve long-term control of disease. Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced\nby ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates\ninflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the\npotential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. We have recently utilized novel preclinical models to provide\ndefinitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific T cell immunity and the re-establishment of a state of\nimmune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these systems\nis a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive populations\nand the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. These inhibitory pathways are highly\namenable to immunotherapeutic approaches after ASCT that invoke long term survival. This proposal will utilize\nsophisticated protein and transcriptional based approaches to examine the relationship of T cell function in the\nperi-transplant period to subsequent survival and disease control in well-annotated clinical cohorts. A major focus\nwill be the optimization of innovative immunotherapy approaches after ASCT in preclinical systems for clinical\ntranslation.

project	1U01CA244314-01	9868156	2019	Human CD3epsilon co-potentiation to boost immunotherapy	Grant	Project Summary / Abstract\nA novel approach to exogenously manipulate the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) on T cells has been found that\nincreases the sensitivity of these lymphocytes to identify and attack cancer cells in mice. This approach holds\npromise to function as an effective immunotherapy against metastatic cancers in humans using monovalent\nFab fragments (Mono-Fabs) specific for the CD3 complex that is associated with the TCR. In the absence of\nstrong antigen, anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs do not stimulate T cell immune function because they do not crosslink\nreceptors for intracellular signaling. However, when exposed to antigen, T cells treated with anti-CD3 Mono-\nFabs increase their level of response to weak antigenic stimulation in vitro, indicating that the Fabs bound to\nCD3 alter the TCR/CD3 complex and enhance T cell triggering, an effect we denominate ‘receptor co-\npotentiation’. When tested in mice in vivo, anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs display therapeutic properties against\nmetastatic melanoma that depend on the presence of T cells able to recognize antigens associated with the\ntumor. Since anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs target the TCR/CD3 complex, testing combinations with alternative\nimmunotherapies that target other receptors on T cells was. Anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs showed a synergistic effect\nwith the alternative immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibition or adoptive cell therapy, which resulted in\nsignificantly extended survival of the mice tested. Now, Mono-Fabs specific for human CD3 have been\nidentified that may mediate T cell co-potentiation in vitro, as well produce anti-tumor T cell responses in two\ndifferent and ccomplementary humanized-mouse models of metastatic melanoma. In the present proposal,\ntransgenic mice expressing human CD3 will be crossed with inbred and outbred mouse strains in order to\nproduce different degrees of genetic diversity to resemble adult humans. Additionally, so called “dirty mice”\nfrom pet stores will also be co-housed with human CD3-transgenic mice to induce levels of “foreign” and\nimmune experience that better correspond with those observed in adult human immunotherapy patients. Mice\nfrom these various conditions will be used to determine the extent to which candidate anti-human CD3 Fabs\ndisplay anti-tumor potential against metastatic melanoma (aim 1), in single and combination immunotherapies\n(with checkpoint inhibition and adoptive cell theapy), as well as the extent to which immunotoxicity occurs (aim\n2). Results will inform the choice of optimal candidate(s) to subsequently undergo development for anti-cancer\ntranslational application. Finally, the CD3 signaling mechanism promoted by anti-human CD3e Fabs will be\nstudied in a mechanismtic manner to better understand T cell co-potentiation (aim 3). If successful, this project\nwill produce a novel modality of immunotherapy that may be exploited alone and/or to synergize other\nimmunotherapies, and will provide a biochemical mechanistic basis for this function. The hope is that soon\nthereafter, experimentation might advance these studies to translational application with an ultimate goal of\nhelping prolong survival of patients suffering from metastatic melanoma and additional malignancies.

project	1U01CA244452-01	9869561	2019	Mechanisms of Exosome Driven Immunoregulation of Cancer Progression	Grant	PROJECT ABSTRACT:\nAntibodies against the immune checkpoint proteins PD-L1 and PD-1 have revolutionized cancer therapeutics\nresulting in durable remissions in many patients previous considered incurable. However, a majority of patients\nremain resistant and cancer types can vary greatly in their response rates. Thus, there is an urgent need to\nunderstand the variation in response in order to improve cancer care. This proposal brings together a team of\ninvestigators with complementary expertise in basic, translational, and clinical science who share the long-term\ngoal of finding novel approaches to categorize and personalize cancer treatments. Recent results from the\ninvestigators suggest a major role for the packaging of immune checkpoint proteins in exosomes underlying the\nvariation in responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors among patients. Specifically, varying amounts of PD-L1\ncan be trafficked to exosomes, which in turn can act at a distance to suppress anti-tumor T cell function, enabling\ntumor progression, even in models resistant to anti-PD-L1 treatments. The objective of this proposal is to build\non these findings by focusing on the mechanism of exosomal PD-L1 packaging, action, and resistance to\ntherapeutic antibodies. In particular, the proposal will test the overall hypothesis that tumor cells can selectively\npackage PD-L1 into exosomes that suppress T cell priming at distal sights in a fashion that is distinct from the\ncell-cell interactions of PD-L1 and PD-1 normally seen in the tumor bed. The hypothesis is premised on extensive\npreliminary data using in vitro and in vivo models showing that the relative fraction of PD-L1 packaged in\nexosomes versus retained in cells varies between cell lines, that suppression of exosomal PD-L1 can result in\nlong-term systemic anti-tumor immunity, and that exosomal PD-L1 is resistant to anti-PD-L1 antibodies. To test\nthe overall hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: 1) Uncover mechanisms underlying the selective\npackaging of PD-L1 into exosomes, 2) Evaluate the mechanistic basis of exosomal PD-L1’s impact on systemic\nimmunity, 3) Dissect how exosomal PD-L1 interacts with and regulates its target cells. In aim 1, structure/function\nand proteomic approaches are proposed to identify the regulators of PD-L1 packaging into exosomes.\nFurthermore, associations between expression of these factors and resistance to therapy will be evaluated using\nprimary patient samples. In aim 2, mouse-based immunological approaches and patient samples will be used to\ndetermine where in the immune axis exosomal PD-L1 functions. Uncovered insights will then be used to develop\na novel therapeutic approach to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. In aim 3, microscopy and functional\nstudies in in vitro models along with association studies with patient samples will be used to determine how\nexosomal PD-L1 interacts with its target cells potentially explaining its resistance to antibodies. The proposal is\nhighly significant in that it is expected to provide new fundamental knowledge that can be used to identify and\ntreat the large fraction of patients resistant to current immune therapies. While this proposal focuses on a subset\nof cancer models with a particular emphasis on prostate cancer, the paradigms uncovered are expected to be\nrelevant across most if not all tumor types.

project	1U01CA246568-01	9892593	2019	Utility of memantine in preventing cognitive dysfunction in children receiving cranial radiotherapy	Grant	ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether oral memantine daily for 6 months, when compared to\nplacebo, is associated with reduction in decline of cognitive function at 12 months in children ages 4-18\nreceiving cranial radiotherapy (RT) for primary central nervous system tumors and to correlate protective\neffects of memantine with imaging biomarkers. Radiotherapy is a proven curative therapeutic tool in the\ntreatment of primary brain tumors. However, cranial RT results in significant cognitive morbidity. The\nmechanisms of radiation-induced injury result in a picture that is a combination of the small vessel disease\nseen with vascular dementia as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s dementia. Ischemia\nand injury can induce excessive NMDA stimulation and lead to excitotoxicity, and pre- clinical data suggests\nthat selective blocking of the NMDA receptor can restore long-term potentiation and restore learning in both\nmodels of ischemia as well as models of radiation injury. Memantine is a non- competitive, low-affinity, open-\nchannel NMDA blocker, which has been shown to be neuroprotective in pre- clinical models. In two placebo-\ncontrolled phase III trials, memantine proved to be effective treatment for Alzheimer’s and vascular\ndementia, especially for patients with small-vessel disease. Memantine has also proven effective in reducing\ncognitive dysfunction in adults receiving whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases. Memantine delayed\ntime to cognitive decline and reduced the rate of decline in memory, executive function and processing\nspeed. Importantly, cognitive function in patients receiving memantine remained stable even after\nmemantine was discontinued; suggesting memantine had a protective effect rather than simply a therapeutic\neffect. In this study, we propose evaluating the efficacy of memantine in preventing cognitive dysfunction in\npediatric patients receiving cranial radiation through the clinical trial mechanism of the Children’s Oncology\nGroup. This study is novel in that children will undergo early cognitive evaluations (baseline prior to\nradiation, 3, 6, and 12 months post-radiation) with a brief computerized testing battery that we will correlate\nwith formal cognitive testing as well with long-term cognitive function (30 and 60 months) assessed with both\nmethods. If successful, this study will provide validated early cognitive assessment time points that correlate\nwith late cognitive toxicity and result in an framework for accelerated study design that will allow for early\nassessment of efficacy for future neuro-protectant trials. Dose- and volume-dependent reduction in brain\nvolume is seen after radiotherapy exposure and is associated with cognitive decline. We hypothesize that\nneuroprotection with memantine will also preserve relevant brain volume and this will correlate with domain-\nspecific improvements in cognitive function. We will use quantitative volumetric MRI analysis to correlate\nprotective effects of memantine with brain substructure (white matter, hippocampus, frontal lobes etc) volume\nchanges over time and correlate with cognitive assessments. Radiographic analysis will provide proof-of-\nprinciple for the mechanism of action of memantine as well as a biomarker that can be utilized in future trials\nof radio-protectants, which is especially important for young patients or patients not neurologically capable of\ncompleting cognitive assessments but who may benefit the most from neuroprotective interventions.

project	1U01CA246612-01	9893629	2019	Using Information Technology to Improve Outcomes for Children Living with Cancer	Grant	This application plans to develop a program, Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and\nReporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS), to enable timely mitigation and management of\nunrelieved symptoms for children with cancer. The SyMon-SAYS will administer, score, interpret and display\nthe results of symptom assessments in “real-time” between clinic visits in cancer care ambulatory settings,\nwhen patients are likely to be more symptomatic. We hypothesize that this system can facilitate prompt\nidentification of problematic symptoms; consequently, with the availability of graphical symptom reports over\ntime, timely providers’ clinical care, and an informative symptom management booklet, patients will become\ninformed about their condition and take an active role in treatment, which will further improve self-management\nskills. Better self-management promotes adherence to treatment plans, builds individual capacity, improves\ninteraction between patients and caregivers, reduces the use of medical specialists, and optimizes clinical\noutcomes across the lifespan throughout the treatment and disease continua. The proposed waitlist control\nrandomized trial is based on our preliminary study testing the feasibility of the patient-centered SyMon-SAYS in\na pediatric oncology clinic. Results showed that the SyMon-SAYS was acceptable to patients/parents and they\nwere willing to use it during their routine clinical care. Clinicians expressed interest in receiving reports yet\npreferred to review them in the medical record. Based on what we learned from this pilot, we now propose to\nintegrate the SyMon-SAYS system into the electronic health record (EHR), to streamline the alert notification\nwith clinician workflow by using EHR (Epic) messaging, and to include a broader range of symptoms. Patients\nand parents will complete the weekly symptom assessment and review the symptom report by logging into the\nEpic MyChart patient portal. Instead of using a standalone SyMon-SAYS app, we will align the SyMon-SAYS\nprogram with the Epic EHR. We plan to conduct a single institution modified waitlist control randomized trial of\n200 children (ages 8-17) with cancer over 16 weeks (Group A: 16-week SyMon-SAYS intervention; Group B:\n8-week usual care and then 8-week SyMon-SAYS intervention) to achieve the following specific aims: 1)\nevaluate effectiveness of SyMon-SAYS at week-8 and its maintenance effects at week-16. We hypothesize\nthat Group A (versus Group B) will report decreased parent-perceived barriers to managing their children’s\nsymptoms, decreased patient symptom burden, increased patient and parent self-efficacy, and ultimately\nincreased patient HRQOL at week-8 and no significant differences between Groups A & B at week-16; 2)\nevaluate influential factors to Aim 1, including contextual patient and parent factors, adherence to the SyMon-\nSAYS intervention, and symptom communication; and 3) evaluate predictors of adherence to the SyMon-SAYS\nintervention and preference of SyMon-SAYS versus usual care.

project	1U01CA246665-01	9895223	2019	A Randomized Trial of a Mobile Health and Social Media Physical Activity Intervention Among Adolescent and Young Adult Childhood Cancer Survivors	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nInterventions to increase physical activity (PA) are vitally needed in adolescent and young adult childhood cancer\nsurvivors (AYA survivors) who are largely inactive but are at lifelong elevated risk of cardiomyopathy, insulin\nresistance, and other cardiometabolic disorders. To reach AYA survivors, their desire for peer connections,\nalmost ubiquitous use of smartphones and social media, and strong preferences to exercise in their homes and\ncommunities and as part of social activity must be leveraged. The intervention must also be accessible and\naffordable for patients without private health insurance as they are less likely to receive survivorship care and\nmore likely to have greater morbidity. The transdisciplinary study team has completed two recent pilot studies\namong AYA survivors that provide substantial scientific premise for the proposed research by demonstrating\nthat the intervention is feasible, has high rates of uptake and adherence, and appears promising for increasing\nPA. The proposed multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will enroll 384 AYA survivors currently ages 15.0-\n20.9 years who are 3-36 months off therapy and not meeting PA guidelines. The 12-month trial will test the\nefficacy of a 6-month intensive multi-level PA intervention combining a wearable Fitbit PA tracker (intrapersonal\nlevel) with integration of activity data leading to individualized goal setting by text (intrapersonal level) and a\nprivate Instagram account serving as a virtual peer support group of survivors (interpersonal and community\nlevel) followed by a 6-month maintenance phase to improve PA in AYA survivors. Given the ubiquity of PA\ntracking devices and apps, the control group will receive the Fitbit only without integration of Fitbit data in other\nactivities. A nationwide sample of patients drawn from rural, urban, community, and academic centers will be\nrecruited using the Children’s Oncology Group consortium of >200 hospitals. This rigorously designed, multi-site\nRCT will test the efficacy of the mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention, compared to the control group,\nto achieve the following Specific Aims among AYA survivors over 12 months: Aim 1 - To increase PA; Aim 2 -\nTo improve biomarkers predictive of cardiometabolic health; and Aim 3 - To improve health-related quality of life.\nAnalyses of hypothesized mediation factors for Aims 1-3 and post-trial qualitative interviews among participants\nwith and without private health insurance will provide explanatory knowledge to help refine intervention\nprocedures and tailor the intervention for future RCTs among patient subgroups who will most benefit. If shown\nto be efficacious, this mHealth intervention to improve PA in AYA survivors is highly scalable because\nsmartphones and social media are widespread, PA trackers are popular and affordable, goal setting can be\nautomated, and social media activities do not require specialized staff.

project	1U01DE029188-01	9869230	2019	Defining mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nPD1 checkpoint blockade with nivolumab or pembrolizumab has given new hope for poor prognosis\nrecurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, but response rates of only\n15-20% highlight the need for continued investigation. In this application, we have assembled a\nmultidisciplinary team to address tumor cell intrinsic and adaptive resistance programs that are a critical barrier\nto immunotherapy. Together, this targeted and discovery based approach coupled with human functional\nimmunophenotyping aims to generate new translational approaches to improving response rates for HNSCC\npatients. The foundation of this proposal is based on supporting data showing robust preclinical modeling\nplatforms that span the spectrum of clinical responses to anti-PD1 therapy including response, intrinsic and\nadaptive resistance. Using high dimensional time of flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and an isogenic model of\nresponse and resistance, we identified distinct tumor microenvironmental remodeling with anti-PD1 and anti-\nCTLA4 therapies. We also completed a genome scale CRISPR screen for T cell recognition in a PD1 resistant\nHNSCC model and identified 355 candidate genes that may regulate this interaction. Candidates included\nones that may be relevant in all cancers as well as ones specific to HNSCCs. A major category to emerge from\nthis and other screens represents targets in the chromatin accessibility pathway. We validated a top screen\ncandidate that modulates chromatin accessibility, the histone methyltransferase and transcriptional regulator\nEzh2, and identified reduced anti-PD-1 resistance in combination with Ezh2 targeting. These data illustrate the\nvalidity of our approach as well as potential for clinical translation, as agents targeting Ezh2 are currently in\nclinical development. In a separate study of immunotherapy treated HNSCC patients, we identified mutations\nin SMARCA4, a catalytic subunit key for the PBAF nucleosome remodeling complex, in immunotherapy\nresponsive HNSCC patients, highlighting chromatin remodelers as modulators of immunotherapy response in\npatients and the potential for improved clinical management by targeting these activities in conjunction with\nimmunotherapy. In the proposed work, we will complete analysis of Ezh2 targeting with further validation of\ncandidate immunotherapy resistance modulators. Coupled with these preclinical studies we will complete\nfunctional immunophenotyping of human HNSCC patients using CyTOF and a novel patient derived\norganotypic platform. In parallel to these preclinical approaches, we have a strong clinical trial portfolio\nincluding a novel neoadjuvant pembrolizumab clinical trial that has shown surprising pathologic response in a\nsubset of patients and highlights this approach as an ideal setting in which to address resistance mechanisms\nin previously untreated patients. We will interrogate genomic data from our neoadjuvant trial to assess\nresistance mechanisms defined in preclinical models. In conclusion, this integrated approach will define\nmechanistic and therapeutic approaches to address the intrinsic immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC.

project	1U01DE029255-01	9864460	2019	Robust Immuno-prevention Strategies for High-Risk Oral Epithelial Dysplasia	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\n Immune checkpoint blockade has proven an effective treatment for a subset of head and neck cancer\n(HNC) patients. However, over 85% of the patients cannot benefit from this strategy, largely due to the highly\nimmunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in established cancers. Oral leukoplakias / Oral Epithelial\nDysplasias (OEDs) precede HNC and offer a unique time window for disease eradication. However, surgical\nresection in the orofacial region results in significant morbidity and function loss, and more importantly, cannot\nreverse field cancerization. A subset of OEDs transform into malignancy despite vigilant follow-ups. Frequent\nimmune cell infiltration is a common feature of OEDs, however, little is known about when and how OEDs\nevade from immuno-surveillance and reach a point-of-no-return. In addition, it remains unclear which sub-\ngroup of OEDs is more likely to suppress host immunity and establish themselves as high-risk lesions.\nAmplification of the chromosome locus 3q26.3 is a defining genomic feature of HNC, and two oncogenes at\nthis locus inhibit innate immune sensing pathways and elicit a metabolic restraint in the TME, which collectively\ndisadvantage anti-tumor immune cells. We have developed strategies to bypass the inhibition of innate\nimmune sensing and synthesized a novel drug-like molecule that exhibits potent metabolic remodeling\npotential and anti-tumor activity in vivo. We constructed two unique genetically engineered mouse models,\nwhich can model a spectrum of OED/HNC lesions with high-fidelity histologic and immunophenotypic\nresemblance to human diseases, to recapitulate 3q26.3-driven OED transformation. We also identified unique\ncollections of case-control and longitudinal paired OED/HNC specimens, which allow us to validate key\nfindings on the temporal shift of exploitable immune targets with clinical specimens. The overarching goal of\nthis translational program is to test the hypothesis that 3q26.3 amplification is a key early high-risk event that\nleads to OED immune escape and that a combination of metabolic remodeling agent with immunotherapy\neffectively prevents OED progression. Thus, this proposal is fully responsive to the RFA-CA-19-014 and is\nfocused on the deeper understanding of the time-course of immune landscape shift as pre-malignant lesions\nprogress, using 3q26.3 amplification-driven OEDs as a high-risk disease model. We will qualify a novel\nmetabolic remodeling drug-like molecule as a priming agent to maximally improve immuno-prevention. The\n3q26.3 amplification is not unique to HNC and commonly found in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung,\nesophagus and skin, hence, our findings will help address a broad class of public health concerns.	3q26;Address;Agonist;Automobile Driving;Bypass;CD8B1 gene;Cells;Chromosomes;Clinical;Collection;Cross-Priming;Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes;Dendritic Cells;Disadvantaged;Disease;Disease model;Effector Cell;Epithelial;Erythroplasia;Esophageal carcinoma;Event;Excision;Exhibits;Gene Expression Profile;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Glucose;Glycolysis;Glycolysis Pathway;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Histologic;Human;Hypoxia;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immune response;Immunity;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;Infiltration;Interferon Type I;Interferons;Intraepithelial Neoplasia;Lead;Lesion;Longitudinal cohort;Lymphocyte;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic stress;Modeling;Molecular Profiling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mucous Membrane;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oral;Oral Leukoplakia;PIK3CA gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Premalignant;Prevention;Prevention strategy;Public Health;Regimen;Resolution;Signal Transduction;Skin Carcinoma;Specimen;Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma;Stains;Subgroup;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Time;Tumor Burden;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Warburg Effect;cancer cell;case control;combinatorial;design;effective therapy;extracellular;head and neck cancer patient;high risk;high risk population;human disease;immune activation;immune checkpoint blockade;improved;in vivo;individualized medicine;inhibitor/antagonist;loss of function;malignant mouth neoplasm;mutant;novel;novel therapeutics;oral cavity epithelium;orofacial;prevent;programs;public health relevance;recruit;response;restraint;tumor;tumor hypoxia;tumor microenvironment	UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR	ANN ARBOR	MI	UNITED STATES	John Chadwick Brenner,Yu Leo Lei,NOURI  NEAMATI	DCTD	ZHONG  Chen	3799975	2516200	2019-09-25T04:00:00Z	2019-09-24T04:00:00Z	2024-08-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-19-014	Moonshot
project	1U54CA231630-01A1	9833682	2019	Defining and targeting the molecular vulnerabilities of the PAX3-FOXO1 protein in rhabdomyosarcoma	Grant	ABSTRACT – Overall (revised)\nFusion-positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) remains one of the most fatal but least understood cancers of childhood. The driving oncoprotein in ARMS is the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein, a chimeric transcription factor that hijacks normal gene expression and chromatin state. Five-year survival for children with PAX3-FOXO1- positive ARMS is ~30% for all-comers, and <10% when metastatic. Despite the discovery of PAX3-FOXO1 in 1993, treatment strategies for affected children remain unchanged. This deficiency stems equally from a lack of understanding of the basic biology of the disease and an inability to directly target the fusion protein. No systematic or comprehensive approach has been undertaken to identify the proteins and regulatory elements required to support PAX3-FOXO1-mediated tumorigenesis. As a result, the field has been limited to a patchwork of data with no unified scientific strategy. To overcome this, this FusOnC2 Center has an innovative team and dynamic environment in which data interpretation is informed by complementary technological approaches and by biological and clinical knowledge. This comprehensive approach will transform understanding of PAX3-FOXO1-mediated oncogenesis and create opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The Center’s overarching goal is to advance the therapeutic tractability of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein in ARMS by comprehensively identifying the druggable co-regulators, modulators, and intrinsic activities of PAX3-FOXO1. To accomplish this goal, the Center includes two complementary Projects, each led by expert RMS biologists paired with specialists in pioneering experimental approaches undertaking the most cutting-edge research in cancer biology, genomics, proteomics, structural biology, and medicinal chemistry. The Projects will be supported by RMS investigators within each project who will provide curated RMS cell lines, unique human primary RMS tumor cells, and murine models to enable rapid in vitro and in vivo validation and cross-prioritization of targets. An Administrative Core will integrate and coordinate the Center components, providing leadership and oversight, and promoting cross-pollination of ideas and resources. The Overall Specific Aims are to: (1) define and target the PAX3-FOXO1 interactome; and (2) perform chemical probe discovery for PAX3-FOXO1 to create additional tools for investigating the fundamental biology and tractability of PAX3-FOXO1 and fusion-positive RMS. Approaches used include proximity labeling, saturation mutagenesis, single and combinatorial CRISPR screens, high-throughput phenotypic assays, and mechanistically unbiased approaches to chemical probe discovery using novel high-throughput binding assays. We will use information gleaned to prioritize targets and agents for validation and to inform compound optimization and PROTAC preparation. This Center’s strengths and resources will synergize with the FusOnC2 Consortium, speeding development of knowledge generalizable to the biology of multiple fusion oncoproteins in childhood cancers, accelerating advances in clinical care.

project	1U54CA231649-01A1	9834547	2019	Targeting EWSR1-FLI1 through Functional, Structural and Chemical Approaches	Grant	Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone and soft tissue malignancy in children and adolescents. The\nfive-year survival of Ewing sarcoma patients is 70%, and falls to less than 20% for those with metastatic\ndisease, a situation that has not improved despite many years of increasingly intensive chemotherapy\nregimens. Survivors of Ewing sarcoma often suffer long-term deleterious effects of treatment. An immediate\nneed exists for the development of effective, targeted therapies with decreased toxicity. Molecularly, Ewing\nsarcoma is characterized by one of several reciprocal chromosomal translocations that fuse a FET family\nprotein with an ETS transcription factor, the most common of which is EWSR1-FLI1. The EWSR1-FLI1 fusion\nprotein is completely specific to Ewing sarcoma tumor cells, and thus presents an ideal target for novel\ntherapeutics. To date, however, no such targeted therapy has become clinically available, owing to 4 major\nknowledge gaps. First, there is a dearth of robust in vitro model systems for functional studies of EWSR1-FLI1.\nKnockdown studies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines can give inconsistent results, and few primary cell types\ntolerate exogenous EWSR1-FLI1 expression. Second, the protein encoded by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion is a\ntranscription factor, and there is widespread perception that such proteins are “undruggable”. Third, lead\ncandidates of small-molecule screens reported to date have either not been shown to have a mechanistic link\nto EWSR1-FLI1, or fail to replicate the phenotype of Ewing sarcoma cells depleted of EWSR1-FLI1 activity.\nFourth, the field has lacked relevant animal models for functional genomics and preclinical testing. Developing\ntargeted therapy for Ewing sarcoma will require an integrated approach executed by an experienced team. Our\nstrategy is based on several fundamentals, namely 1) systems to specifically deplete and reconstitute the\nEWSR1-FLI1 protein in cells; 2) an understanding of the structural biochemistry of low-complexity (LC)\ndomains found in EWSR1 and related proteins; and 3) novel in vivo models of Ewing sarcoma for functional\ngenomics and drug testing. Standing on this foundation, we will perform biochemical and genetic experiments\nto identify the binding partners and functional effectors of EWSR1-FLI1 and dissect its mechanisms of\ntranscriptional activation. We will use our experimental systems to conduct phenotypic and target-based high-\nthroughput screens. Finally, we are well-positioned to perform the work required to transform a compound with\npromising initial activity into a preclinical drug lead. Our approach to drug discovery is built upon medicinal\nchemistry coupled with secondary assays that maximize potency and specificity of lead compounds. We will\nperform target identification for lead compounds using strategies our team has successfully used for several\nagents currently in active preclinical development. A dedicated preclinical pharmacology core, highly integrated\nwith the projects and with the high throughput screening core and medicinal chemistry core, will ensure\noptimization of delivery, PK/PD and toxicity properties of the most promising lead compounds.

To complement the funded U54 (Maris and Mackall, MPI) of the PI-DDN that largely\nseeks to harness adaptive immunity to further develop CAR-T cells against newly identified antigens, we propose\nto harness innate immunity to target pediatric cancers, to circumvent resistance to conventional therapy, and to\nfurther enable adaptive/hybrid immune approaches.\nOur aims are to (1) Identify and overcome barriers to utilizing NK and CAR-NK cells as cancer therapeutics, (2)\nbreak tolerance to “self” cancer-associated proteins and (3) enhance immunotherapies by targeting suppressive\nmyeloid cells. We will accomplish our aims through four projects, based at two major sites based in Ohio\n(Nationwide Children’s Hospital) and New York (New York Medical College) with subsites in Columbus (The\nOhio State University) and Minneapolis (Univeristy of Minnesota). In addition to an Administrative Shared\nResource (Core A, directed by Dr. Timothy Cripe and Associate Director Dr. Mitchell Cairo), the projects are\nscientifically supported by a comprehensive Genomics & Immune Monitoring Shared Resource (Core B, directed\nby Dr. Elaine Mardis with several subspecialy assistant directors). Core B provides integrated datasets via state-\nof-the-art technologies including mass cytometry, single cell transcriptomics, and an array of other genomics\napproaches that enable detailed characterizations and tracking of cancer cell immunogenicity, the tumor immune\nmicroenvironment, and immunologic responses. We have also assembled strong external and internal scientific\nadvisory boards of renowned leaders whose expertise spans the projects and shared resources. The projects\nare highly integrated and cross-informative. We propose that therapeutic regimens that combine modalities will\nproduce synergy that drives anti-tumor immune responses in preclinical pediatric cancer models, overcoming\nthe limitations of low mutational burdens. Our goal is to generate a sufficient body of knowledge with compelling\ndata to inform the rational design of future clinical trials and thereby improve the lives of children with cancer.\n1	Address;Adoptive Immunotherapy;Adoptive Transfer;Adult;Antigens;Binding;Biological;Cancer Burden;Cancer Model;Case Study;Cell surface;Cells;Childhood;Childhood Solid Neoplasm;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Combination immunotherapy;Complement;Cytometry;Data;Data Set;Development;Effectiveness;Funding;Future;Genomic approach;Genomics;Goals;Homing;Hybrids;Immune;Immune response;Immunologic Adjuvants;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Inflammatory;Innate Immune Response;Interruption;Knowledge;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Minnesota;Modality;Mutation;Myeloid Cells;Myeloid-derived suppressor cells;Natural Immunity;Natural Killer Cells;New York;Normal Cell;Ohio;Oncolytic viruses;Patients;Pediatric Hospitals;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Physicians;Pre-Clinical Model;Proteins;Regimen;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resource Sharing;STAT3 gene;Scientist;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid Neoplasm;Source;T cell response;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Traction;Transforming Growth Factor beta;Tumor Immunity;Universities;Virotherapy;Virus;Virus Diseases;adaptive immunity;anti-tumor immune response;base;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapy;chemokine;chemoradiation;chimeric antigen receptor;chimeric antigen receptor T cells;combinatorial;conventional therapy;cytokine;design;effective therapy;embryo/fetus antigen;experience;immunogenicity;immunotherapy clinical trials;improved;macrophage;medical schools;neoantigens;novel;oncolytic virotherapy;pre-clinical;resistance mechanism;response;small molecule;success;synergism;trafficking;transcriptomics;translational study;tumor;tumor microenvironment	RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP	COLUMBUS	OH	UNITED STATES	TIMOTHY P CRIPE,Elaine R Mardis	DCTD	Judy  Mietz	10242127	10242127	2019-09-12T04:00:00Z	2019-09-12T04:00:00Z	2024-08-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-19-003	Moonshot
project	1U54CA243124-01	9834651	2019	Experimental and preclinical modeling of NUP98-rearranged acute leukemia	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY - Overview\nFusion oncoproteins (FO) arising from the rearrangement of Nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) to a diverse range of\npartner genes are a hallmark of multiple subtypes of high risk myeloid malignancies in children and adolescents,\nincluding acute erythroleukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Such leukemias are associated with poor\noutcome, and more effective therapies are required. The long-term goal of this Center for Experimental and\nPreclinical Modeling of NUP98 Leukemia is to determine the molecular role, and potential vulnerabilities, of\nNUP98-fusion oncoproteins in leukemia through the development and interrogation of human and mouse model\nsystems, and to develop and test novel therapeutic approaches. The Center has assembled a consortium of\ninvestigators with complementary expertise in genomic characterization, leukemia modeling, chromatin biology,\nstructural biology and preclinical modeling. The Center is led by Dr Charles Mullighan of St Jude Children’s\nResearch Hospital together with Project Co-Leaders Drs Scott Armstrong (Dana Farber Cancer Institute),\nTaosheng Chen (St Jude), Alex Kentsis (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute), Jeffery Klco (St Jude) and\nRichard Kriwacki (St Jude). These investigators will co-Lead four projects performing experimental modeling\n(Project 1), investigating chromatin biology (Project 2), phase separation (Project 3) and drug development\n(Project 4) that will address the following questions and unmet needs: (1) to define how NUP98 fusions drive\nleukemogenesis using complementary, integrative engineered models and proteomic, transcriptomic and\nepigenomic profiles; (2) to develop genetically faithful engineered mouse, human and xenograft models of\nNUP98 leukemia for mechanistic interrogation and preclinical modeling; (3) to define the macromolecular\nchromatin and protein complexes assembled by NUP98 FOs; (4) to define the role of phase separation in NUP98\nFO leukemogenesis; (5) to define the dependencies and vulnerabilities of NUP98-rearranged leukemic cells;\nand (6) to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for NUP98-rearranged leukemia. The Center is\nsupported by an Administrative Core A that with an External Advisory Board will oversee project progress\ninteraction and reporting, a Genome Editing Core B led by Dr David Chen (City of Hope) that provides expertise\nand support for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing scans and screens; and a Chemistry Core C led by Dr Zoran\nRankovic (St Jude) that supports chemical library screen and drug design and development. This highly\nintegrated, interactive and synergistic Center will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of\noncogenesis of the different classes of NUP98 FO, and new therapeutic modalities that will be validated in\npreclinical models and translated into human clinical trials. All data and resources will be made freely available\nby websites, data deposition, and establishment of resource and genomic data portals to the FusOnC2\nconsortium and broad scientific community.

We will use a combination of novel mouse\nmodels and human neuro stem cell systems with readouts of single cell analysis, immunology, tumor\nmicroenvironment, systems biology, and data visualization. In addition to the administrative core, the grant has\nthree main Projects, a data visualization and sharing core. The research projects include, Project 1) Mechanisms\nand models of C11or95 and C11or95-RELA fusions (RELAFus), Project 2) Genetic interrogation of therapeutic\nvulnerabilities for C11orf95-RELA fusion, and Project 3) Identifying small molecules with therapeutic effects in\nRELAFus -driven EPN and testing them in preclinical genetically engineered models of EPN.

project	1U54CA243126-01	9834349	2019	Center for therapeutic targeting of the Fusion Oncoprotein of Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma	Grant	Project Summary / Abstract\nFibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a usually lethal primary tumor in children, adolescents and young adults. The primary tumor is initiated and driven by a single alteration in the DNA: A deletion of ~400kb that results in a fusion gene between the heat shock co-chaperone DNAJB1 and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, PRKACA. If the tumor is limited to the liver, then surgery is the accepted therapy. However, if the tumor has metastasized, there is no accepted therapy. This project will determine how the fusion oncoprotein leads to pathogenesis and will develop therapeutics targeted to the fusion oncoprotein. Pathogenesis is being probed by examining what is different about the fusion oncoprotein that causes changes in the cell. Therapeutics will target the fusion oncoprotein through small molecules to block activity, or small molecules to send it to the proteasome, or small molecules for allosteric inhibition.

project	1U54CA244438-01	9869709	2019	UCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology: Tools to Reprogram the Immune System to Combat Cancer	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nUCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology: Tools to Reprogram the Immune System to Combat Cancer\nThe immune system has emerged as an extraordinarily powerful tool for combating cancer. One of the most\npotent agents are engineered T cells programmed to recognize and kill tumor cells. Nonetheless, our ability to\nengineer T cells and other immune cells and program them to execute new functions remains relatively\nprimitive. Aside from CAR T cells for treatment of blood cancers, most engineered cell therapies are risky,\npotentially highly toxic, unreliable and often ineffective, especially those cell therapies that attempt to target\nsolid cancers. We hypothesize that to fulfil the promise of engineered immune cell therapies, we must first\ntransform cell engineering into a systematic and predictable process; one that uses reliable technology\nplatforms and principles. Our center will focus on developing a set of sophisticated immune engineering\nplatforms that address three major needs in next-generation cell therapies:\n1) Smart recognition of cancer – develop antigen-pattern recognition circuits that direct immune cells to\n optimally recognize solid tumors and discriminate against normal tissue crossreaction, guided by\n computational bioinformatic analysis of gene expression patterns.\n2) Overcoming the tumor microenvironment – develop multiple classes of cellular circuits that can\n overcome or locally remodel immune-suppressive tumor microenvironments to promote highly efficient\n therapeutic immune cell trafficking, proliferation, persistence, and tumor-killing activity\n3) User-control and safety – to increase control over and safety of these powerful engineered cells, we will\n develop a suite of ways to communicate with and control the activity of engineered immune cells in vivo,\n including nano/microparticles and small molecules.\nTo achieve these goals, we have assembled the UCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology, a tightly\nintegrated interdisciplinary team that encompasses synthetic biologists, immunologists, bio-informaticists,\ncontrol engineers, and materials scientists. The products of this center will include publicly available toolkits of\nparts and circuits for cell engineering, high-throughput platforms for rapid circuit assembly, new programmable\nnanomaterials for controlling immune cell behavior, searchable bioinformatic databases for optimization of\ntumor recognition, and computational frameworks for circuit design and for modeling/prototyping in vivo circuit\nfunction. These platforms will help to advance immune cell engineering to be far more reliable, predictable,\neffective and safe.

project	1U54CA244711-01	9870707	2019	Engineering the Next Generation of T Cells	Grant	OVERALL SUMMARY\nThis U54 “Immuno-engineering to Improve Immunotherapy (i3) Center” was developed in response to\nRFA-CA-19-013. The purpose of this U54 is to employ immuno-engineering principles to design more\ndurable, accessible, and less toxic immunoprevention and immunotherapy strategies. A national priority\nset by the Cancer Moonshot initiative is to support studies incorporating next-generation genetic\nengineering, engineered biomaterials, nanotechnology, computational and mathematical modelling, or\nsystems biology approaches in the design, implementation and evaluation of next generation\nimmunotherapies focused on overcoming immunosuppressive barriers, targeting tumor cells for killing,\nand generating long-lasting anti-cancer immunological memory. The focus of our U54 entitled\n“Engineering the next generation of T cells” is on developing next-generation gene-editing or\nmodification of immune cells to improve persistence in vivo, control and manipulate the immune system\nto reduce oﬀ-target toxicities and enhance anti-tumor eﬀectiveness of adoptive cell therapy. Our central\nhypothesis is that next generation engineering can improve the safety and efficacy of CAR T cells\nwhile decreasing the cost of goods. There are three scientific projects in our U54 Center. The shared\ngoal of these projects is to enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with\nblood cancer and solid cancers. In Project 1, we are using CRISPR/Cas9 to edit the epigenome of T\ncells and to make cells resistant to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), while employing engineering\ntechnologies to automate CAR T cell culture. The goal of Project 2 is to generate universal CAR T cells\n(UCART) using advanced genetic editing technologies and then to compare UCAR to autologous CAR\nT in a unique model of canine cancer. In Project 3 we will use advanced protein engineering, cell\nengineering and oncolytic vectors to test synthetic cytokine and cytokine receptor systems in mouse\nand human T cells, with the long-term goal of eliminating or reducing the need for lymphodepleting\nconditioning chemotherapy prior to adoptive cell transfer. Our approach is multidisciplinary and multi-\ninstitutional. We have brought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines\nwho have collaborated and published together for many years. State of the art genetic editing with\nCRISPR/Cas9 and cell culture technologies at the University of Pennsylvania are synergistically\ncoupled with world-class protein engineering and structural biology at Stanford University. Each project\nis led by recognized authorities in the field.\nThe Administrative Core for this U54 is designed to manage and coordinate all i3 Center Research\nProject activities and serve as the liaison between the i3 Center and the IOTN Data Management and\nResource-sharing Center (U24) and other Cancer Moonshot consortia, including the Pediatric\nImmunotherapy Discovery and Development Network (PI-DDN). In addition, the Administrative Core\nwill coordinate collaborative research activities between the i3 Center Research Project PD(s)/PI(s) and\nIOTN (or other) investigators. The potential for paradigm-shifting impact this U54 is to transform the\nlessons of first-generation CAR T for leukemia and lymphoma into meaningful efficacy against all\nmalignancies.

project	1U54CA244719-01	9870537	2019	Nano-Immuno-Oncology Approaches to Overcome Tumor Immune Evasion	Grant	Abstract\n While immunotherapies have achieved remarkable success in cancer care in recent years, a large\npercentage of patients remain unresponsive to currently available treatments. Growing evidence\nindicates dysfunctional innate and adaptive immune responses in the tumor microenvironment are\nresponsible for tumor evasion that limits the efficacy of the current immunotherapies. Efficacious cancer\nimmunotherapy requires a holistic, system approach to identify and engage key molecular and cellular\npathways as well as tumor microenvironment signals to benefit a broad spectrum of cancer patients.\nThe overarching goal of this U54 i3 Center application is to harness research synergy in immunobiology,\nprotein engineering and cancer nanotechnology to develop and validate new nano-immuno-oncology\ntherapeutics for cancer therapy. Four investigators, Zhijian `James' Chen, Yang-Xin Fu, Baran Sumer,\nand Jinming Gao, supported by the Administrative Core, will advance the frontier of knowledge of\nmolecular and cellular engineering of the tumor immune milieu for robust antitumor immunity. Each\nproject will bring a unique toolset and therapeutic strategy to tackle the immune refractory challenges in\nsolid tumors. Dr. Chen will lead Project 1 to investigate the role of cGAS-STING pathway in intrinsic\ntumor immunity and evaluate antitumor efficacy of cGAMP nanoparticles in endogenous tumor models.\nDr. Fu will lead Project 2 to engineer tumor-targeted delivery of CD47 and T cell activators (IL-2/IL-15) to\nstimulate innate and adaptive antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Dr. Gao and Dr. Sumer\nwill lead Project 3 to establish CD47-encoded ultra-pH sensitive nanoparticles as a broad nanoplatform\nfor tumor-targeted delivery of innate and adaptive immune modulators. If successful, our studies will\ndevelop innovative and synergistic combinations of small molecular agonists, engineered antibodies and\ncytokines, and pH sensitive nanoparticle technology. The U54 i3 Center will create a new paradigm for\ncancer immunotherapy by targeting key molecular, cellular and tumor microenvironment signals to\ngenerate and sustain tumor-specific innate and adaptive immunity. Ultimately, this paradigm could\nsignificantly advance clinical care for patients with intractable cancers.

project	1U54CA244726-01	9870084	2019	Biomaterials to Create T Cell Immunity	Grant	Summary – Overall:\nT lymphocyte (T cell) responses against tumor antigens are key to cancer immunotherapy, and this proposal is\nfocused on enhancing T cell mediated anti-cancer immunity using biomaterials. Defects in T cell number,\ndifferentiation, activation and anti-cancer activity can compromise anti-cancer immunity. We envision\nbiomaterials that act at various stages of T cell differentiation and activation to enhance anti-cancer immunity in\na number of settings. This i3 Center will advance efficacious biomaterial-based immunotherapies through\nmarrying the expertise in bioengineering from accomplished investigators at the Wyss Institute for Biologically\nInspired Engineering with the expertise in cancer immunology, stem cell biology, and clinical oncology from\naccomplished basic and translational scientists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General\nHospital. Our groups have made major contributions to the development of checkpoint blockade therapy,\nneoantigen vaccines, cellular therapies, and therapeutic biomaterials in the past, and here will take a material-\nbased approach to address a number of related, fundamental questions in immunoengineering. The Specific\nAims of the i3 Center are: (1) To develop artificial antigen presenting cells that closely mimic normal T cell\nactivation to selectively expand large numbers of highly functional polyclonal antigen-specific CD8 T cells, and\nexplore if adoptive transfer of polyclonal T cells will provide tumor control. (2) Determine if co-delivery of\nneoantigens and adjuvants with precise nanoscale distribution and stoichiometric loading, using DNA origami,\ncan provide a powerful platform to boost the development of cytotoxic T lymphocyte anti-cancer responses, and\n(3) Create biomaterials which recreate key features of the normal hematopoietic stem cell niche, and utilize to\nenable rapid reconstitution of T cells in settings where there are deficiencies in T cell number and repertoire, in\norder to enhance generation of T cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity. The leadership and organizational\nstructure of the i3 Center, which includes a Biostatistics Core, reflect the close collaboration among the\nparticipating disciplines and institutions, and will promote the effective execution of the proposed work and its\nfuture translation to clinical testing. The synergistic set of activities in the i3 not only address specific stages\nwhere immune control can fail, but the lessons learned and technologies developed in each project strongly\nimpact the others. The Center is expected to yield major scientific and translational advances in cancer\nimmunotherapy.

Grant	ABSTRACT\nColorectal cancer (CRC) screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality. The US\nPreventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends CRC screening through a variety of invasive and non-\ninvasive tests for individuals aged 50 to 75 years. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and other strategies\nexist to promote CRC screening, but adoption and implementation of these are limited, especially in CHCs.\nOur hypothesis is that a Hub and Spoke multilevel intervention will be superior to usual care. The hub will be\nHealth Quality Partners of Southern California (HQP), a non-profit organization comprised of 16 CHC systems\n(spokes), serving 135 rural and urban clinic sites. We propose a 2-phase study to pilot and optimize (Phase I)\nand rigorously test (Phase II) the Hub and Spoke approach and its impact on CRC screening, follow-up, and\nusual care. UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary\noutcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed\nmethods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients\nserved by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and\ncoordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3\nImplementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a\nregionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care\namong CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability\nModel (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,\nMaintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness\nof the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post\nimplementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3)\nproportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and\nsustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods\napproach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM\nconstructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e.\npatients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and\nSustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of\nImplementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate\nprogress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are\nscalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.

project	1UG3CA244298-01	9868743	2019	Screening More patients for CRC through Adapting and Refining Targeted Evidence-based Interventions in Rural settings (SMARTER CRC)	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:\nThis two-phase project is designed to achieve the Cancer Moonshot objectives by reducing the burden\nof CRC on the US population. Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up\ncolonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing\nprogram with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage\npartnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest\nCenter for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation\nsupport to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate\nworking with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics\n(reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients).\nIn Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a\nlarge-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor\nsupported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never\nbeen screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to\nsupport follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and\nrecruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the\ntraining and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings.\nIn Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi-\nexperimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice\nfacilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan-\nvendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never\nbeen screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred\nfor colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will\nevaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and\nqualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program\nthrough partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care\nclinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO\n(Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model.

project	1UG3CA244687-01	9870148	2019	Recurrent Tumor-Specific Alternately Processed Transcripts as a Source of Neoantigens for NF1-associated Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor Immunoprevention	Grant	Abstract/Summary\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome is an autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndrome that is\ncaused by loss-of-function mutations of NF1 gene encoding neurofibromin. Among patients with NF1, loss of\nthe non-mutant allele of NF1 in a rare Schwann cell or precursor, along with other ill-defined factors, leads to\nbenign dermal or plexiform neurofibromas. The main cause of death among NF1 patients is the malignant\nperipheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most likely develops\nfrom plexiform neurofibroma, in particular the so-called “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma. Approximately half of\nMPNSTs are NF1-associated, and NF1 patients have 10-15% lifetime risk of developing this terrible cancer.\nMPNSTs metastasize early and are often resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main treatment for\nMPNSTs is surgical resection but, despite radical excision with wide surgical margins, followed by\nchemoradiation, 5-year survival rates are poor due to metastases as well as local recurrence. NF1 patients\ncould greatly benefit from prophylactic vaccination that would prevent the malignant transformation of benign\nplexiform neurofibromas into “atypical” plexiform neurofibromas and to MPNSTs. We aim to determine if the\nmutations that govern the development of “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma (NF1 loss followed by CDKN2A\nloss) and MPSNT (NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12 loss) lead to the expression of recurrent alternately processed\ntranscripts, such as transcriptionally-induced chimeras, that could express neoantigens and be used as targets\nfor prophylactic vaccines. Such transcripts can be translated to produce novel peptides downstream of\nframeshift mutations caused by coding exon read-through into introns, mis-splicing from a coding exon to a\nnon-canonical splice acceptors or splice acceptors in other genes. In most cases, a premature termination\ncodon (PTC) will be rapidly encountered by the ribosome translating such transcripts. Therefore, we\nfurthermore hypothesize that these alternately processed transcripts can express what we call “cryptic”\nneoantigens when treated with drugs that suppress utilization of premature codons such as Ataluren or\ngentamycin. In such a way, we could administer a prophylactic vaccine and induce conditionally active immune\nresponse that would eliminate nascent tumors only when drug treatment is used.

project	1UG3CA244697-01	9870498	2019	Intercepting progression from pre-invasive to invasive lung adenocarcinoma	Grant	Abstract\nDespite advances in therapeutic strategies, non-small cell lung cancer remains a deadly disease. An\nimproved understanding of the biology of lung cancer is needed to intercept the disease at an early point in\nits progression. Our project, which is inspired by that challenge, focuses on events transpiring in the earliest\nradiographically-detected manifestation of lung cancer: the computerized tomography (CT)-detected non-\nsolid nodule, of which as many as 40% harbor frankly invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, despite conventional\nwisdom that CT-detected non-solid nodules represent pre or minimally invasive malignancy, clearly transition\nto more invasive histologies occurs in a significant proportion of these nodules.\nUnderstanding the cellular and molecular changes within non-solid nodules that drive progression will provide\nunique and novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that\nalterations in cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a role in initiating and supporting this\nprogression. In agreement with that proposal, our preliminary multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) studies\nsuggest that progression to a more invasive phenotype is associated with the development of a strong\nimmunosuppressive TME. In this project we test our hypothesis using multidimensional methods to profile the\nTME and to determine the crosstalk between cancer cells and the TME in pre-invasive to invasive human\nlung non-solid adenocarcinomas. Comparative analysis of the cellular and molecular events associated with\nthe distinct histological stages will lead to identification of the critical events triggering progression and\nthereby identify targets to intercept disease progression. We will use appropriate mouse models in pre-clinical\nstudies to develop these targets as strategies to intercept progression of pre-invasive to invasive cancer.\nIn the first phase of these studies (UG3 phase), we will define TME alterations associated with progression of\nlung nodules using RNAseq profiling and image-based methods (multiplex IF and imaging CyTOF) in studies\nof our archival tumor samples. These studies will generate a comprehensive catalogue of the cellular and\nmolecular events that trigger progression of indolent lesions to frankly invasive cancers, with a strong focus\non immune mechanisms. These analyses will provide novel and detailed insights into how the composition\nand activity of the TME changes with progression. In the second phase (UH3 phase), we will leverage mouse\nmodels to explore interception strategies to target immune mechanisms and prevent progression.\nThe proposed cohort satisfies the RFA’s focus on High-Risk Cohorts for Cancer-Immunoprevention Studies,\nsince lung nodules are premalignancies highly prevalent in smokers.

project	5U19CA214253-02	9739310	2019	Research on Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry: Defining the Roles of Genetics, Immunity and Stress (RESPOND)	Grant	Abstract – Program Project Overview\nAfrican American (AA) men have a >60% higher incidence and are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive\nPCa than white men. Reasons for the greater burden of aggressive disease in AA men are unknown, but are\nlikely to include a multitude of factors including social factors such as lifetime stress, inherited susceptibility, and\ntumor-related features such as somatic alterations and local inflammation in the microenvironment. The\noverarching goal of this Program Project is to uncover the social and biological factors that are related to PCa\naggressiveness in AA men. To accomplish this objective, we will establish a large, national, population-based\ncohort study, RESPOND, (Research on Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry: Defining the Roles of\nGenetics, Immunity and Social Stress) of 10,000 AA men with incident PCa identified through nine SEER and\nNPCR U.S. cancer registries from states that include 38% of all AA PCa cases in the U.S.. The cohort will provide\ncomprehensive information on multilevel stressors over the lifecourse such as discrimination, early-life adversity,\nand neighborhood disorder, including geospatial neighborhood data over time and degree of perceived stress;\n2) lifestyle factors and health behaviors; 3) disease-specific factors including PSA screening history and\ntreatment choice; 4) germline DNA to study genetic susceptibility, and 5) tumor block samples for\ncharacterization of somatic variation and immune profiling of the tumor microenvironment. No previous study\nhas attempted to obtain information across these domains in a single large sample in order to understand the\nrelative contribution of each and relationships between molecular and non-genetic components. In order to\naddress these goals, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and clinicians with established\ntrack records in PCa research. Leveraging the RESPOND resource and investigator expertise, we have\ndesigned a Program Project composed of four Projects that are supported by four Cores which are all focused\non the central theme of identifying social and biological factors related to PCa disease aggressiveness in AA\nmen. These Projects include: the investigation of multilevel social stressors across the lifecourse in relationship\nwith aggressive PCa (Project 1); genome-wide discovery efforts of germline susceptibility loci for aggressive\nPCa and examination of the relationship between germline and somatic variation (Project 2); the identification\nof underlying somatic alterations in PCa tumors and biological pathways that are related to aggressive disease\n(Project 3); and, a detailed assessment of inflammation in the tumor microenvironment as it relates to PCa\naggressiveness in AA men (Project 4). Each of the four Projects address a distinct research domain, however,\nwhen studied together, create scientific synergy and a far more comprehensive picture of the major factors that\ncontribute to aggressive PCa in AA men. The information we will discover is likely to have immediate clinical\nimplications in the areas of improved patient stratification and personalized medicine. Hence, this study has\nbroad reaching significance and addresses numerous challenges in the clinical management of PCa in AA men.

project	1R01CA249419-01	9966703	2020	The EPICS (Engaging Primary care in Cancer Survivorship) study: A randomized trial of novel models of care for cancer survivors	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nSignificant growth in the number of cancer patients, particularly those ≥65 years, is predicted within the U.S\nover the next 20 years. The majority of these patients will enter into a prolonged post-treatment survivorship\nphase of care. However, we are currently facing unprecedented challenges in survivorship care delivery.\nSerious gaps in the care of survivors have been identified, including underuse of guideline-recommended\ncancer surveillance services, such as annual mammography for breast cancer survivors and colonoscopy for\ncolorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, and underuse of recommended preventive care services such as\nvaccinations, lipid testing and cardiovascular risk management, and disease screenings. Compounding these\nissues, our current oncology workforce is insufficient to care for the rapidly growing population of survivors.\nPrimary care provider (PCP)-led survivorship care is a feasible model of survivorship care. In observational\nstudies, survivors who receive care that involves PCPs received higher quality of care; international\nrandomized trials comparing PCP-led to oncology-led survivorship care have shown no significant differences\nin time to detection of cancer recurrence or quality of life for early-stage survivors. However, there is a paucity\nof high-quality research on models of survivorship care in the U.S, particularly in community-based settings,\nseriously limiting our ability to provide high-quality cancer survivorship care. To address these issues, we will\nconduct a prospective cluster randomized trial of two models of cancer survivorship care in early-stage, low-\nrisk breast cancer and CRC survivors cared for in a community-based, integrated health care setting. Building\non our pilot work and drawing on the empirical literature, we will test the efficacy of an embedded PCP model\n(experimental condition) in which PCPs are embedded within an oncology practice and will care for low-risk\nsurvivors who will be transitioned at 12 months post-treatment. These PCPs will be given training in cancer\nsurvivorship care focused on cancer surveillance and chronic disease prevention. This model will be compared\nto the extant oncology physician model (usual care) that is the default condition in this healthcare system. The\nprimary outcome will be receipt of guideline-recommended care (e.g., cancer surveillance, preventive care),\nassessed over a 36-month period. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated\nmeasures of patient-provider communication, care coordination, quality of life, self-efficacy in managing care,\nand other measures. We will also compare utilization of unplanned care (hospitalizations, urgent care) and\nreceipt of non-recommended care. We will explore PCP perceptions of confidence in delivery of survivorship\ncare. We will conduct this trial in 8 large, hospital-based medical centers of an integrated health care system,\nKaiser Permanente Southern California, with approximately 2,000 early-stage breast and CRC survivors. Our\nresults will provide more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of a scalable model of PCP-led survivorship\ncare, addressing the critical shortage of oncology providers while maintaining or improving quality.

project	1R01CA249460-01	9967342	2020	Technology-Enabled Activation of Skin Cancer Screening for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Survivors and their Primary Care Providers	Grant	SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nHematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative option for a growing number of patients with hematologic\ndiseases and malignancies. However, HCT-related factors, such as total body irradiation used for conditioning,\ngraft-versus-host disease, and prolonged exposure to immunosuppressive therapy, result in very high risk for\nsubsequent skin cancers. Compared with the general population, HCT survivors are also more likely to develop\nskin cancers at a younger age, have advanced disease at presentation, and experience multiple recurrences.\nDespite this high burden, less than 20% of long-term HCT survivors report being examined for skin cancer, even\nthough >90% were seen by their primary care physician (PCPs) in the prior year. In HCT survivors, skin cancers\ndevelop at a time when their follow-up care has largely transitioned from oncology care to the primary care\nsetting, emphasizing the need to develop innovative strategies that 1) provide HCT survivors with the skills to\nconduct effective skin self-examinations, and prompt action from their providers when worrisome lesions are\nfound; 2) engage PCPs in HCT risk-based screening for skin cancer; and 3) ensure rapid access to dermatologic\nexams. Advances in technology, including widespread availability of cell phones and teledermoscopy (remote\nexpert assessment of a photographed lesion) offer promising opportunities to improve early detection and\ntreatment of skin cancer. We propose a comparative effectiveness study that will examine the impact of patient\nactivation and education (PAE), alone or in combination with physician-tailored strategies, on clinically\nmeaningful behavioral outcomes. We will enroll 720 HCT survivors at a large, diverse HCT center to:\n1) Determine the impact of PAE alone or with physician activation (PAE+Phys) on skin cancer screening and\nprevention practices at 12 months; and 2) Among PCPs of HCT survivors, determine the impact of a\nteledermoscopy e-learning program compared with provision of print materials for identifying suspect lesions.\nWe hypothesize that compared to PAE, patients randomized to PAE+Phys will report higher rates of thorough\nself- and provider skin exam, shorter time to referral of suspicious lesions, and improved quality of life; compared\nto print materials alone, physicians randomized to teledermoscopy e-learning will have greater recognition of\nsuspect lesions and more appropriate, cost-effective referral patterns. Our multi-disciplinary team will: 1)\nestablish the efficacy of PAE, and the relative benefit of physician activation; 2) inform the practice of skin cancer\nscreening using innovative mobile strategies that are readily applicable in the clinical setting; and 3) identify\nfacilitators of and barriers to appropriate delivery of survivorship-focused preventive care for long-term HCT\nsurvivors. Information obtained from the current study can be used to develop strategies for management of\nother late effects (e.g. cardiovascular, endocrine) in HCT survivors in the primary care setting, and to improve\nskin cancer screening in other high-risk (e.g. radiation-exposed) cancer survivor populations.

project	1R01CA249467-01	9967391	2020	Optimizing Functional Outcomes of Older Survivors After Chemotherapy	Grant	Project Summary:\nThe overarching goal of this proposal, submitted in response to RFA-CA-19-035, is to evaluate if an aging-\nsensitive survivorship intervention improves outcomes valued by older adults and their caregivers\nduring the transition into survivorship from curative-intent chemotherapy. This proposal is important\nbecause by 2040, 73% of survivors will be aged 65+ and almost 50% will be aged 75+. Unfortunately, aging-\nrelated conditions (e.g., physical and cognitive function impairments) are not addressed routinely in survivorship\ncare. Preliminary research by all multiple principal investigators (MPIs: Mohile, Janelsins, Mustian) suggests that\na Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) intervention is effective for surveilling, triaging and managing\nphysical and cognitive impairments, improving patient and caregiver satisfaction, and fostering communication\nabout aging-related conditions during chemotherapy in older cancer patients and their caregivers. Preliminary\nresearch by MPIs also suggests that a Survivorship Health Promotion program is effective for improving physical\nfunction among older survivors after chemotherapy. Our MPI team has shown that GEM and Survivorship Health\nPromotion are feasible to implement in older patients, survivors and caregivers in nationwide samples recruited\nvia the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP)\nResearch Base network. To fill existing empirical gaps in survivorship care for older survivors and caregivers,\nwe created a novel intervention called Survivorship-GEM by combining these two very promising and synergistic\nprograms. Survivorship-GEM is directed by oncology advanced practice providers (APPs), because they\nroutinely direct care for survivors in the community. We propose to conduct a two-arm cluster randomized trial\ncomparing the efficacy of our novel Survivorship-GEM intervention to usual care for improving physical and\ncognitive function, satisfaction with care, completion of referral appointments, and hospitalizations among older\nsurvivors. We will also examine the effect of Survivorship-GEM on oncology APP communication with primary\ncare providers and on caregiver distress and satisfaction with care. We will randomize 30 NCORP community\noncology practices to two arms: 1) Survivorship-GEM or 2) usual care. Survivors aged 65+ (n=720) and\ncaregivers (if available, estimated n=500) will complete baseline assessments at the end of curative-intent\nchemotherapy for a solid tumor malignancy with follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Our uniquely qualified,\nmultidisciplinary team includes expertise in geriatrics, clinical trials, nursing, primary care, behavioral oncology,\nrehabilitation, health disparities, biostatistics, and implementation science. The team also benefits from\ncollaborations with the Cancer and Aging Research Group Advisory Board and the SCOREboard patient\nadvocate group. The APP-directed Survivorship-GEM intervention is highly innovative and has tremendous\npotential to improve outcomes in older survivors and caregivers by surveilling, triaging and managing the effects\nof chemotherapy and by fostering health promotion.

project	1R01CA249501-01	9967767	2020	Self-Management to Optimize Survivorship Care and Outcomes in Lung and Colorectal Cancer	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe overarching goal of this five-year grant proposal, submitted on behalf of the Beckman Research Institute of\nCity of Hope and the University of California, Riverside, in response to RFA-CA-19-035, is to test the efficacy\nof an advance-practice nurse (APRN)-driven telehealth Survivor Self-Management (SSM) Intervention in 414\nlung and colorectal cancer survivors. This research is critical because lung and colorectal cancer survivors\nhave high post-treatment needs, are older, and suffers from greater co-morbidities and poor quality of life\n(QOL). Lung and colorectal cancer survivors remain underrepresented in research, leading to significant\ndisparities in post-treatment outcomes. Based on the Chronic Care Self-Management Model (CCM), the SSM\nIntervention includes the following components: 1) care coordination and communication between oncology\nand primary care on surveillance/follow-up, health promotion, disease prevention, and comorbidity\nmanagement; 2) provision of clinician care plan to PCPs; 3) comprehensive patient/geriatric assessment for\nsurvivors of all ages; 4) personalized care plan for survivors; and 5) survivor self-management skills building\nfor surveillance/follow-up, late and long-term effects of treatments, comorbidities, and healthy living. It is\nadministered in five telehealth sessions (Zoom videoconferencing) and three subsequent maintenance\ntelehealth sessions for survivors who are four months post-treatment. We will test the efficacy of the SSM\nIntervention using a randomized design of attention control arm versus an intervention arm to pursue the\nfollowing specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (Primary): Determine the efficacy of the intervention on care\ncoordination, communication, and provider knowledge at 4 months post-accrual; Specific Aim 2 (Primary):\nDetermine the efficacy of the intervention on survivor outcomes at 4 months post-accrual; and Specific Aim 3\n(Exploratory): Assess the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the\nintervention. The RE-AIM Framework informs intervention delivery process, which will set the stage for future\nlarge scale implementation for sustainability in real-world care settings. This proposal is innovative because it\naddresses a critical need to improve care delivery and outcomes for high needs, understudied survivorship\npopulations (lung, colorectal, older survivors), and the telehealth approach promotes scalability. The\ninterdisciplinary team, which includes expertise in nursing science (Sun, Reb, Ferrell), oncology (Fakih), and\nprimary care (Kim) is uniquely suited to conduct this research. The proposal is significant, with high scientific\nrigor and outcomes that are of critical importance to survivors, clinicians, healthcare systems, the National\nCancer Institute, and the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM. The research will address a critical gap in\nknowledge of how self-management interventions improve care delivery and outcomes during post-treatment\ntransitions to follow-up care.

project	1R01CA249568-01	9968717	2020	Onco-primary care networking to support TEAM-based care - the ONE TEAM Study	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nSince the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released the seminal report, From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor:\nLost in Transition 13 years ago, there has been substantial progress in understanding the health issues\naffecting cancer survivors, yet little has changed regarding survivorship care delivery. There remains a\ndisconnect between primary care providers and oncology care teams that has led to persistent problems\nimplementing risk-stratified survivorship care for cancer survivors.\nWith advances in cancer therapy and improved survival rates, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease\n(CVD) now exceeds that of the cancer for many survivors. While cancer therapy may contribute to this risk, it is\ngenerally a compilation of non-modifiable factors (i.e., genetics, aging), as well as modifiable lifestyle behaviors\n(i.e., diet, exercise) that lead to both the cancer and to cardiovascular disease (CVD). With the lack of primary\ncare provider (PCP) integration in the cancer care team and time constraints and difficulty keeping up with\nrapidly evolving non-cancer therapeutics for medical oncologists, there is an inferred lower priority for\ncomorbidity management.\nWe will determine the effectiveness of the multi-level iGuide intervention and the up-titrated iGuide2\nintervention compared with usual care on the primary outcomes. The theory-driven, self-guided iGuide\nintervention consists of patient-level components (video vignettes, patient-facing webinars) and PCP-level\ncomponents (electronic health record [EHR] automated cancer specialist-PCP letter, tele-education series, and\nautomated reminders). The up-titrated iGuide2 intervention consists of tailored patient-level video vignettes\nand targeted EHR specialist-PCP communication.\nThe primary outcomes of the ONE TEAM SMART-design study are (1) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and\nInformation Set (HEDIS) quality measures of management of the three CVD comorbidities (hypertension, type\n2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia) based upon laboratory and clinical measurement; (2) medication\nadherence assessed pharmacy refill data using Proportion of Days Covered (PDC); and (3) patient-provider\ncommunication (Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care). Secondary aims include exploring\nmoderating and mediating factors in each level of the intervention, support of patient-centered outcomes,\nhealth care use, measures of provider activation, and costs of care resulting from the multi-level intervention.\nThe overarching goal of this proposed project is to optimize the management and outcomes of individuals with\ncancer, both during and after treatment, and to develop a ‘low-touch’ multi-level intervention that can be\ngeneralized, adapted and scaled in other health care systems. The proposed ONE TEAM study brings together\na multi-disciplinary research team with the necessary expertise and experience in survivorship research,\npopulation and behavioral science, primary care, oncology, and biostatistics. Results from this intervention will\nhave important implications in the advancement of healthcare delivery for cancer survivors.

project	1U01AI156189-01	9921601	2020	Finding the optimal balance of immunotherapy efficacy and toxicity.	Grant	U01 Abstract\nDespite extensive research into cancer immunotherapy, immune-related adverse events (irAE)\nremain a critical and poorly understood issue. To address this critical need, we have assembled a\nmultidisciplinary research team with broad and relevant expertise. The co-PIs of this proposal have\nexpertise in cancer immunotherapy, immunology, assay development, and bioinformatics. Together, we\nhave assembled a cohort of ~400 cancer patients treated with ICI, collecting longitudinal treatment, efficacy,\nand toxicity data, as well as blood samples at pre-treatment baseline, throughout therapy, and at time of\ntoxicity. In our real-world data set, over 10 percent of cases have a history of autoimmune disease,\nproviding insight into use of ICI in a population widely excluded from clinical trials yet routinely treated with\nthese therapies off protocol. Our high-quality clinical data annotation—without which correlative studies\nhave little meaning—addresses the reality that irAE may occur months after ICI initiation and are far more\ncomplex to detect and characterize than toxicities of conventional chemotherapy or molecularly targeted\ntherapies. Through existing funding mechanisms, we have already completed autoantibody, cytokine,\ngenetic, and functional assays in these cases. However, we do not currently have resources for\ncomprehensive, integrated analysis of these diverse laboratory and clinical data. The overarching goal of\nthis U01 proposal is to determine the optimal balance between ICI efficacy and toxicity, ultimately\nidentifying a set of biomarkers useful for selection of patients, treatment type and duration, and\nclinical monitoring. We will achieve this through determination of cellular immunity, comprehensive data\nanalysis, and clinical validation. We have three Aims: (1) Determine cellular immunity in patients\nexperiencing irAE and/or achieving beneficial responses from ICI. We will perform mass cytometry\n(CyTOF) and T-cell receptor sequencing at multiple time-points. (2) Determine genetic, humoral, and\ncellular factors associated with irAE and/or beneficial responses from ICI. We will develop a database\nto integrate and analyze the CyTOF and T-cell receptor sequencing data with clinical efficacy and toxicity\ndata, as well as data from the assays already completed through other mechanisms. (3) Perform analytical\nand clinical validation of emerging biomarkers. We will apply the best classifying phenotypes emerging\nfrom our comprehensive and integrated data analysis to a test set of patients from our existing cohort,\neventually identifying a subset of biomarkers with potential for clinical application. Together, these Aims\ndirectly address the FOA purpose of reducing the incidence and/or severity of irAE while retaining anti-\ntumor efficacy.

project	1U01AR077511-01	9920595	2020	Identification of  pathways to mitigate Immune-Related Adverse Events with Cancer Immunotherapy 	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:\nThe emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) has significantly improved outcomes for patients with a\nvariety of malignancies. By blocking the inhibitory signaling pathways of T cells, CPIs are associated with a\ndiverse spectrum of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Immune-related cutaneous adverse events (ircAE)\nare the most frequent AE and may result in CPI dose interruption or discontinuation. Current guidelines\nrecommend corticosteroids for the management of irAEs including those affecting skin. Yet ~25% of ircAEs are\nsteroid unresponsive, and their use has revealed a negative effect on survival, underscoring the need for early\nidentification of corticosteroid unresponsiveness and rational therapies. Although the underlying pathogenic\nmechanism of irAEs remain elusive, autoimmune and autoinflammatory reactions have a putative role in their\ndevelopment and maintenance. Thus, understanding the pathogenic events underlying irAEs are critical to their\nprevention and treatment. The underlying mechanisms of irAEs remain a significant knowledge gap that we will\naddress in this proposal. Our Central Hypothesis is that patients with ircAEs have unique endotypes\nassociated with polarized immune responses in the skin and blood, which results in corticosteroid responsive\nand unresponsiveness reactions that may require intervention with targeted immune pathway blockade. In\naddition, we hypothesize that specific ircAE skin manifestations are associated with unique immune dermatologic\nresponses. Cutaneous irAEs give us a unique opportunity to understand the immune reaction in the involved\nend organ and systemically. We will test our central hypothesis through;\nAim 1: Define and correlate ircAE phenotypes with their immune reaction endotype and response to toxicity-\ndirected therapy. In this aim we hypothesize that ircAEs are associated with distinct, polarized immune\nendotypes that correlate with specific cutaneous phenotypes and predict response to available interventions\n(corticosteroids, biologics targeting inflammatory pathways).\nAim 2: Identify skin and circulating lipid biomarkers which occur during and after ircAEs. This aim tests the\nhypothesis that distinct ircAE clinical phenotypes and their endotypes will manifest unique changes in the skin\nstructural and circulatory signaling lipidome and suggest novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate ircAEs.\nAim 3: Determine mechanisms associated with corticosteroid unresponsiveness in patients with ircAE. This aim\ntests the hypothesis that steroid unresponsiveness can be defined by understanding the major mechanistic\npathways involved, and ultimately allow targeted therapy to resolve the ircAE.\nIn this translational approach to understanding ircAEs, our goal is to define in patients, the mechanisms involved\nin ircAEs, activated polarized pathways, and advance our understanding of translational immunology as well as\nlead to actionable interventions to mitigate these devastating AEs that can limit cancer therapy.

project	1U01CA232819-01A1	9848432	2020	Evaluation of Population Based Testing for HBOC and Lynch Syndromes	Grant	SUMMARY\nThe standard of care for genetic testing of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome and Lynch\nsyndrome is based on guidelines from the NCCN. The paradigm was developed based on the principle that\ngenetic testing was expensive and that the incidence of these syndromes was low. Over the past twenty years\nthe price of testing has fallen dramatically and it is now recognized that both HBOC and Lynch syndrome are\nrelatively common (joint incidence of about 1 in 200). Many individuals in the population are affected by HBOC\nor Lynch but come from small families with few female relatives. Given the decreases in family size that have\noccurred over the past 50 years this is becoming a common situation. It is estimated that only 20% of those\naffected by HBOC are aware of their condition. Overall, there is a significant unmet need for those with HBOC\nand Lynch syndrome to be identified so they can have the opportunity for appropriate medical care.\nWhat we need are approaches that can rapidly, accurately, and inexpensively identify those with inherited\ncancer syndromes. The costs of sequencing have fallen dramatically and members of our team have QIAseq\nbased targeted resequencing platforms for germline studies that dramatically lower the cost of panel based\nsequencing while allowing easy, rapid multiplexing. The costs of testing will be near $90 per sample. We have\ntaken the task of developing a strategy that can be applied to detect HBOC and Lynch syndromes in broader\npopulations.\nWe will study the effectiveness of population scale testing of these two syndromes by enrolling 27,500\nindividuals, who are (a) eligible for inherited cancer syndrome testing (2,500) (b) have had cancer but are not\ncovered by current screening guidelines to receive a low cost genetic screen (7,500) or (c) healthy (17,500).\nThose individuals identified to have Lynch or HBOC will be followed for outcomes and compared to a matched\ncohort identified following standard screening guidelines. Additionally, relatives of those identified will be\nenrolled in cascade screening. We will determine if testing either cancer patients or the general population\nrepresents a sustainable strategy for population screening based on QALY measurements.

project	1U01CA232827-01A1	9848358	2020	Innovative Approaches to Expand Cancer Genetic Screening and Testing for Patients & Families in a Statewide Oncology Network through Community, State, & Payer Partnerships	Grant	Germline genetic variants that impact cancer risk, prevention, and treatment strategies are implicated in up to\n20% of cancers; however, only a fraction of people at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes undergo diagnostic\ngenetic testing. Barriers to testing, at both the patient and provider levels, include gaps in knowledge and poor\naccess to specialty genetics services. This multiphase project seeks to employ practice-level and patient-level\ninterventions to increase the proportion of patients in whom family history is documented and assessed for\ngenetic risk and in whom guideline-concordant genetic evaluation is completed. This proposal leverages\nexisting partnerships between a statewide oncology network, public health agencies, payers, and a\nmultidisciplinary team at the University of Michigan to encourage systematic family history ascertainment and\ngenetic risk assessment among newly-diagnosed cancer patients cared for in 68 medical and gyn-oncology\npractices. In partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and a network of nearly\nall oncology practices in Michigan, the Michigan Oncology Quality Consortium, we will deploy interventions to\npromote collection and assessment of family history and genetic evaluations for eligible patients with breast,\ncolorectal, ovarian, prostate and endometrial cancer cared for in diverse clinical and geographic settings\nacross the state. The first Specific Aim is to test the impact of innovative practice-based interventions on the\nproportion of patients who have a comprehensive family history documented in their medical record. In the first\nphase, using a stepped-wedge design, we will provide a tablet-based family health history survey tool to\npractices and evaluate the impact of the tool on quality measures of family history documentation and guideline\nconcordant genetic referrals. In the second phase, at Year 4, we will test the impact of adding value-based\nreimbursement using family history ascertainment as the quality improvement metric. The second Specific Aim\nis to evaluate the impact of two behavioral interventions (tailored messaging via mobile optimized web\ninterface vs genetic counseling using motivational interviewing) on uptake of genetic testing among patients\nwith cancer who meet clinical criteria and disclosure of genetic test results to at-risk relatives. Our third Specific\nAim addresses longitudinal follow up of cancer patients, exploring uptake of cascade genetic testing in families\nwith germline mutations. These projects directly address implementation and dissemination of genomic\nmedicine in diverse settings and will leverage both new and well-established partnerships among community\nand academic oncology practices, public health agencies, and payers in the state of Michigan. The University\nof Michigan is a leader in genomic medicine, behavioral interventions with diverse populations, healthcare\npolicy, and implementation science, and the proposed work engages multidisciplinary expertise in caring for a\ndiverse patient population and developing sustainable and scalable approaches for precision oncology in\ndiverse healthcare settings.

project	1U01CA247548-01	9921121	2020	Humoral immunity after CAR-T cell therapy for B cell malignancies: The HICAR Study	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe development of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies (CARTx) for B cell malignancies is a major\nmilestone in cancer immunotherapy with high rates of durable complete remissions. Although cytokine release\nsyndrome and neurotoxicity are the earliest and most dramatic immune related adverse events (irAEs) after\nCARTx, severe manifestations are transient and only affect a minority of patients. In contrast, on-target, off-\ntumor depletion of non-malignant B lineage cells affects the majority of patients and all long-term responders.\nCD19 expression declines as B cells differentiate into plasma cells, whereas BCMA is selectively expressed by\nplasma cells. Since plasma cells are responsible for maintaining long-lived antibodies and naïve/memory B cells\nare important for generating new immunity, CD19 versus BCMA-CARTx may differentially affect preexisting\nimmunity and vaccine responses. Dr. Hill’s goal is to understand the long-term effects of CARTx on humoral\nimmunity. This proposal incorporates the expertise of an outstanding group of researchers in infectious diseases,\nimmuno-oncology, epidemiology, laboratory medicine, and statistics who are dedicated to ensuring the success\nof this innovative research proposal. They will leverage their expertise and high-volume immunotherapy\nprograms to achieve the following aims.\nThe first Aim involves a prospective observational cohort study of 130 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 50\npediatric CD19, 30 adult BCMA) with relapse-free survival ≥6 months. Dr. Hill will use a novel systematic viral\nepitope scanning method (VirScan) to longitudinally characterize the antivirome to 206 viral pathogens. These\nresults will describe, and identify correlates of, antivirome diversity metrics at 6- and 12-months post-CARTx.\nVirScan will allow for a nuanced assessment of the differential impacts of CARTx on humoral immune\ncompetence. The second Aim will utilize samples from Aim 1 to determine the effect of CARTx on the durability\nof preexisting humoral immunity to vaccine-preventable infections and the proportion of patients lacking\nseroprotection after CARTx. These data will expand on Aim 1 to inform vaccination strategies. In the third Aim,\nDr. Hill will perform a prospective observational study of 95 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 25 pediatric CD19,\nand 20 adult BCMA) to define the frequency and correlates of positive vaccine responses ≥6 months after\nCARTx. Patients will be vaccinated for S. pneumoniae, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, H. influenza b, and\nhepatitis A and B according to institutional guidelines.\nThis proposal will address critical knowledge gaps by employing innovative methods to elucidate the scope of\npathogen-specific deficits in humoral immunity, and whether vaccination can mitigate these irAEs, after CARTx.\nThe findings will guide evidence-based strategies for infection prevention, such as vaccination or immunoglobulin\nreplacement, to improve outcomes in this rapidly growing population of high-risk individuals.

project	1U01CA247573-01	9921971	2020	Engineering immunotherapeutic probiotics to mitigate irAE	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nIn recent years, the field of cancer immunotherapy has seen a renaissance – with the use of monoclonal\nantibodies that target immune checkpoints to activate anticancer immune responses demonstrating unparalleled\nclinical success. Several of these therapies have now gained FDA approval and are part of routine treatment\nregimens for several malignancies. Despite the overall success of immunotherapeutic regimens, existing\nmodalities present complications that current research efforts seek to overcome: (1) systemic delivery of\ncheckpoint blockade monoclonal antibodies lead to diverse and unpredictable immune-related adverse events\n(irAE), (2) boosting responses from the endogenous antitumor repertoire often relies on the existence of pre-\nprimed antitumor T cells, which in the case of highly immunosuppressive tumors or those with low mutational\nburden may be extremely rare, and (3) attempts to combine immunotherapies to additively boost T cell responses\ndemonstrate increased on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Thus, to circumvent toxicity and immunosuppression,\ncontemporary strategies focus on developing methods to deliver potent immunostimulants directly into a tumor,\nlocally priming antitumor T cells to attack disseminated metastases exhibiting a similar antigenic profile. Bridging\nthese observations, the goals of this proposal are to engineer probiotic strains of bacteria that selectively colonize\ncolorectal cancer (CRC) and locally release immune checkpoint blockade. We hypothesize that this approach\nwill result in more robust and diversified antitumor T cell immunity and promote the clearance of colonized\nprimary and metastatic colorectal cancer lesions and systemically growing CRC-derived foci. The primary\ninnovations of this proposal are in engineering probiotics as an immunotherapeutic delivery vector to locally\nrelease high-dose immune checkpoint blockade. Specifically, the proposed system has several advantages over\ncurrent therapeutic strategies, including: (1) tumor-specific production of immunotherapies and LPS adjuvant,\n(2) bacteria lysis, leading to effective release of novel immunotherapeutics and LPS, (3) local delivery of novel\nimmunotherapeutics that are toxic to deliver systemically, and (4) oral delivery of probiotics that selectively\ncolonize CRC metastases. This work seeks to shift current research and clinical practice paradigms to overcome\ncurrent limitations of immunotherapies, by providing a unique vehicle to locally deliver immunotherapies that\nstimulate antitumor immunity while preventing systemic toxicity and mitigating irAE.

project	1U01CA247576-01	9921965	2020	Adrenergic modulation of cellular immune functions in CAR T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome	Grant	Immunotherapy using tumor-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells (CART) is a rapidly-\nemerging, promising cancer therapy that can elicit rapid, durable clinical responses, seen in anti-CD19 CART\n(CART19)-treated CD19+ B-cell malignancies. However, CART-evoked severe or fatal immune-related adverse\nevents (irAE) including cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) are significant clinical barriers and safety concerns\nthat impede CART use in cancer patients, even with strict patient monitoring and supportive care. Current tools\nfor mitigating such immunotoxicities/CRS target individual cytokines/receptors (e.g. IL-6R, IL-1Ra, GM-CSF) or\nnonspecific immunosuppression, but preventing and treating such toxicity will require better understanding of\ncellular/molecular mediators of CART-induced CRS. This project aims to overcome these barriers and enable\nmore effective interventions against immunotoxicities, and thus more effective CART treatments, building upon\nthe PIs' novel, potentially translatable findings of a key role of catecholamines (CATs) in shaping CART therapy-\nassociated immune activation. We found that blocking CAT synthesis both reduced CRS during CART therapy\nin mice and also enhanced its tumor eradication, and also found that CAT levels are elevated in patients with\nCART-evoked CRS, and correlated with symptoms and IL-6 levels, suggesting CATs contribute to human CRS\npathophysiology. The project's goal is to identify the mechanistic CRS-modulating roles of these novel CAT\nactions and their impacts on macrophages and anti-tumor responses, and assess translational potential for\nimproving CART cancer therapy outcomes using human patient samples. Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the\nmediating α1-AR subtype and its role in modulating CART-evoked cytokine release and anti-tumor responses in\nvitro and in vivo, based on our finding that CAT-associated cytokine release is mediated by α1-adrenergic\nreceptors (α1-AR), of as-yet unknown subtype(s). We will identify the α1-AR subtype(s) that mainly mediate(s)\nCAT-evoked cytokine production in macrophages and CART, using in vitro co-culture assays and a mouse CART\ntherapy model via genetic knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) of α1-AR subtypes. 2) Determine the impact of\nmyeloid-derived CATs on cytokine release and myeloid function during CART-therapy in vitro and in a mouse\nmodel, by inactivating CAT synthesis in myeloid cells via tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) KO, and assess its impact\non cytokine release and macrophage function in a co-culture assay and in vivo using a LysM-Cre-mediated TH\nKO mouse. 3) Assess CAT induction in human patients during CART therapy, and CATs' dual impacts on irAE\nand tumor responses, and potential utility of CAT measures and blockers in predicting and preventing CRS, by\nquantifying circulating CAT and cytokine levels in patient serum samples collected during CART therapy, and\nevaluating correlations of CAT levels with clinical and laboratory CRS indices, anti-tumor responses and survival.

project	1U01DK124165-01	9928257	2020	Characterizing and predicting colitis in immune checkpoint blockade-treated cancer patients	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\n The first combination immunotherapy of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) approved for\nmelanoma in 2015 has achieved longer progression-free survival compared to nivolumab alone (11.5 vs. 6.9\nmonths), with 53% of patients still alive at 4 years, of whom 71% remain treatment free. Yet, safety is the\nbiggest barrier to broader implementation of this successful combination, due to much greater occurrence of\nserious immune-related adverse events (irAEs) compared to nivolumab alone. In particular, immune-related\ncolitis (irColitis) is the most common occurrence, with 10-15% of patients developing it upon receiving anti-\nCTLA-4 alone or in combinations. Such irColitis is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment with high-\ndose steroids or biologics such as anti-TNF, as well as ipilimumab or immunotherapy discontinuation. These\nsafety concerns have hampered the development of CTLA-4 targeting agents and may have reduced their\nefficacy due to lower recommended dosing in combination therapy and limited treatment course. There is\ntherefore an urgent need to comprehensively study the nature of irColitis and find whether potential risk factors\ncould be identified and mitigated for greater safety and efficacy of combination treatments.\n We have assembled a unique team of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) scientists and clinicians, tumor\nimmunologists, microbiome specialists, and medical oncologists specializing in immunotherapy of melanoma to\nanalyze colorectal tissue lesions, the gut microbiome, and peripheral blood biomarkers that could predict or\ncontribute to development of irColitis. By comparing what we already learned from studying biospecimens of\nIBD patients, i.e., their genetic subsets at the single cell level, gut microbiome, and predictive immune\nsignatures, we aim to characterize the transcriptomic, immunopathologic, serologic, and gut microbiome\nlandscape of irColitis and leverage this knowledge for better therapeutic options.\n We will address irColitis by characterizing gut biopsies of melanoma patients during treatment using single-\ncell RNA sequencing and multiplex immunohistochemistry mapping, and we will relate immune subsets and\nmarkers discovered to those found in IBD lesions. We will also measure peripheral blood serologic markers\n(anti-microbial and anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies by ELISA, soluble cytokine and protein analytes with Olink\nproximity extension assay) that we recently found to be risk factors detectable prior to development of IBD, and\nanalyze them for their capacity to predict irColitis. From stool collected before and throughout treatment, we\nwill analyze by 16S and metagenomic sequencing the gut microbiome of melanoma patients with or without\nirColitis to compare it to known colitogenic structure in IBD, and functionally assess bacterial communities in\ngnotobiotic models. Finally, we will integrate our findings to establish a mechanistic model of irColitis compared\nto IBD, to propose novel stratifications of cancer immunotherapy patients by risk factors, and to offer future\ntherapeutic opportunities, such as actionable tissue genomic and protein targets or fecal transplants.	16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Address;Antibodies;Autoantibodies;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;CTLA4 blockade;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials Design;Colitis;Colorectal;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Crohn&apos;s disease;Data;Development;Disease remission;Dose;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Feces;Flowers;Future;Genetic;Genomics;Gnotobiotic;Goals;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immunohistochemistry;Immunologist;Immunotherapy;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Intestines;Knowledge;Lamina Propria;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical Oncologist;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibodies;Nature;Nivolumab;Patient risk;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Predictive Value;Progression-Free Survivals;Proteins;Proteomics;Risk Factors;Safety;Scientist;Serological;Serum;Serum Markers;Specialist;Specimen;Steroids;Stratification;Structure;Symptoms;TNF gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Treatment Side Effects;Ulcerative Colitis;anti-CTLA4;anti-PD-1;antimicrobial;bacterial community;base;cancer immunotherapy;clinical development;cytokine;density;fecal transplantation;frontier;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;immune checkpoint;immune checkpoint blockade;immune-related adverse events;improved;melanoma;metagenomic sequencing;microbial;microbiome;microbiome analysis;microbiome composition;novel;patient subsets;peripheral blood;predictive marker;prospective;response;serological marker;single cell analysis;single-cell RNA sequencing;targeted agent;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions	ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Jean-Frederic  Colombel,Jeremiah James Faith,Sacha  Gnjatic	DCTD	Terez  Shea-Donohue	594873	397393	2020-06-01T04:00:00Z	2020-06-01T04:00:00Z	2025-05-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-19-044	Moonshot
project	1U24CA252977-01	10048476	2020	Participant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS): Coordinating Center	Grant	Abstract\nCancer genomics aims to improve our understanding and treatment of all cancers by identifying differences in\nDNA sequence and gene expression between tumor cells and normal host cells. Cancer genomics has\ncontributed to many advances in treating several cancers, but the field is limited by a lack of genomics data. The\nParticipant Engagement and Cancer Genome Sequencing (PE-CGS) Network will promote and support\nresearch on direct participant engagement approaches to address these gaps, especially among rare cancers,\nhighly lethal cancers, cancers with an early age of onset, cancers with high disparities in incidence/mortality, and\ncancers among under-represented minorities.\n Our team wishes to contribute to the important work of the (PE-CGS) Network by serving as its\ncoordinating center. We have the necessary faculty, resources, and experience to address the needs and\ngoals of the Network by supporting network coordination, promoting effective and equitable outreach and\npromotion, and establishing and disseminating network best practices. In addition to meeting all the requirements\nof the RFA, we bring innovation by establishing Participant Engagement Community (PEC) by applying the\nprinciples of community-based participatory research and by promoting a diverse pool of future scientists,\nespecially those from underrepresented groups through a Summer Scholar Program and by two post-doctoral\npositions that will be supported by our comprehensive cancer center.\n Our proposal for the coordinating center is focused around four specific aims. First, we will effectively\nmanage administrative and scientific coordination of the PE-CGS network. This will include providing\nadministration/coordination, governing all advisory, organizing meetings/site visits, fostering collaboration,\ndissemination and implementation, and coordinating communication. Second, we will foster effective and\nculturally appropriate outreach and promotion activities. We will establish a common branded, public relations,\ncommunication resources, facilitating interactions, and managing outreach. Third, we will develop and\ndisseminate network best practices and data collection/processing standards. We provide support for participant\nengagement and cancer genome sequencing activities, establish data standards, ensure data are accessible to\nthe public, data are appropriately shared, and support efforts to make the Network sustainable. Finally, we want\nto address health disparities and promote equity throughout the Network and ensure there is a diverse pool of\nfuture scientists, including those from underrepresented groups, to support future efforts in participant\nengagement and cancer genomics. We envision that the network will need to evolve to address emerging issues\nin participant engagement and believe that being based in a university setting will provide us the capacity to\nanticipate and address these issues as they emerge. We are strongly supported by the OSU College of Medicine,\nthe OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the OSU Center for Clinical and Translational Science.

project	1U2CCA252973-01	10048641	2020	Engagement of American Indians of Southwestern Tribal Nations in Cancer Genome Sequencing	Grant	While American Indian (AI) Tribes and communities are highly diverse in ethnicity, language, and culture, there\nis one unfortunate characteristic that they share: profound cancer health disparities. Compounded by\ndisproportionately low rates of cancer screening and more limited access to healthcare, AI are more often\ndiagnosed at later stages of disease and have the poorest outcomes in all types of cancer when compared to\nany other racial and ethnic group in the United States. The cause of these significant cancer health disparities is\nundoubtedly multifactorial. However, an unexplored factor is the molecular characterization of tumors arising in\nAI. American Indians and Alaska Natives (AN) have been strikingly understudied in The Cancer Genome Atlas\nProject (TCGA) and account for only < 0.5% of the cancer patients studied. Of the nearly 11,000 patients\nsequenced in TCGA to date, only 27 (0.25%) were identified as AI/AN. It is our hypothesis that through\nappropriate participant and community engagement and comprehensive genomic sequencing, we will discover\nnovel somatic and germline mutations, differences in the spectrum and/or frequency of cancer-promoting\nmutations, and genome-wide mutational signatures reflective of behaviors and exposures, that can ultimately be\ntranslated to improved cancer screening, precision prevention, and therapeutic intervention in American Indian\nparticipants and communities. In this application, we will focus on the molecular characterization of cancers\nwhich show significant disparities in AI of the Southwest, including gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary cancers\n(stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, liver, gallbladder and biliary tree); genitourinary cancers (kidney, prostate\ncancer); and other hormone-dependent cancers (breast, ovarian cancers). Our Specific Aims are to develop\nculturally-appropriate, respectful, and trusted means to: 1) Engage American Indian participants (cancer patients\nand survivors) and their Tribal communities in participatory research studies of the molecular characterization of\ncancer, particularly focusing on cancers that display striking disparities in incidence and outcome in Southwest\nTribal Nations; 2) Discover novel somatic and germline mutations and/or differences in the spectrum and\nfrequency of cancer-promoting mutations, and genome-wide mutational signatures reflective of specific\nbehaviors and exposures, in American Indian participants, relative to other racial and ethnic populations in the\nU.S. and the world; 3) Disseminate knowledge gained through these studies to Tribal participants and Tribal\nCouncils, leaders, stakeholders, and communities using unique means of participant engagement and novel\nmeans of communication, such as visual arts and media, that are sensitive to cultural and religious beliefs and\npractices and that acknowledge the indigenous languages and dialects, many of which lack many scientific and\nmedical terms for words and concepts such as cancer, gene, genomics, mutation, and DNA, and 4) (Share\nknowledge with the broader scientific community through the NCI Genome Data Commons and publication of\nscientific results in accordance with NIH Data Sharing Policies and Tribal Agreements.

project	1U2CCA252974-01	10048560	2020	Count Me In: Partnering with patients to define the clinical and genomic landscape of rare aggressive sarcomas in children and adults	Grant	Osteosarcoma (OS) and leiomyosarcoma (LMS) are exceedingly rare cancers, both subtypes of sarcoma,\nthat arise in bone and smooth muscle respectively. There has been a failure to improve survival rates or decrease\ntreatment-related morbidity in OS/LMS due to insufficient characterization of the genomic landscape, resulting\nin a lack of targeted therapeutic approaches, diagnostic methods, and preventive strategies. There is an urgent\nneed for a large, shared database of clinical and genomic data in OS and LMS. Yet, because of the rarity of\nthese tumor types as well as other challenges in patient recruitment and the genomic characterization of these\ntumors, to date it has been difficult to generate this data. The overarching goal of this proposal is to engage\nadult and pediatric participants with OS and LMS as partners to generate a shared database of clinical,\ngenomic, molecular, and patient-reported data. This should accelerate discoveries that drive novel treatment\nstrategies, new clinical trials, and new standards of care. The Count Me In PE-CGS U2C Research Center will\nleverage our experience in patient engagement, genome characterization, computational analysis, and\nbehavioral research to create and launch two patient-partnered projects to generate this clinicogenomic\ndata. We will build two websites with patients in the OS and LMS communities—the Osteosarcoma Project\n(OSproject) and the Leiomyosarcoma Project (LMSproject)—and consent 3,000 patients over the course of the\nstudy. We will collect medical records, patient-reported data, archival tumor tissue samples, and saliva and blood\nfor genomic analysis. We will generate clinically annotated genomic data from at least 750 tumor specimens,\n500 circulating tumor DNA specimens, and corresponding germline specimens and share the de-identified data\nwidely. At the same time, we will study and optimize the approach to patient engagement in cancer research,\nparticularly among rural and minority participants and participants across a range of literacy levels, ages, and\nstages in development. To accomplish these goals, we will build on a well-established interdisciplinary team from\nthe Broad Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute with members who have pioneered these approaches. Our\nleadership (Wagle, Janeway) and Units are comprised of experts in patient-partnered cancer research (Wagle,\nPainter), sarcoma clinical and translational research (Janeway, George, Crompton, Raut), genome\ncharacterization, analysis, and clinical interpretation (Gabriel, Getz, Van Allen, Wagle, Janeway),\ncomputational biology/data science (Getz, Van Allen, Philippakis), and behavioral science (Mack, Rebbeck).\nOur Center will uncover the key clinicogenomic features of OS/LMS, integrate them into a single comprehensive\ndatabase with a goal of accelerating research and improving the lives of these patients. In doing so, we also\naim to present a general approach to patient-partnered research that can be disseminated broadly and applied\nto other tumors types and patient communities.

project	5R01CA176745-09	9929556	2020	Targeting DOT1L for Degradation in MLL-rearranged Leukemia	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nDespite marked progress in the rate of cure among patients with acute leukemia, chromosomal translocations\ninvolving the mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL1) give rise to highly aggressive acute leukemias associated\nwith poor clinical outcomes for pediatric and adult patients. Current treatment options are of limited effectiveness;\nthus, there is a pressing need for new therapies for this disease. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the\nhistone methyltransferase DOT1L is required for the development and maintenance of MLL-rearranged (MLL-r)\nleukemia in model systems. Likewise, work from the previous funding cycle clearly defined a role for DOT1L\ninhibition in MLL-r leukemia through characterization of a potent, specific DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ-5676\n(pinometostat), that has remarkably selective anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on MLL-rearranged\ncells. As pinometostat has progressed through Phase I clinical trials, responses and subsequent relapses imply\nthe development of acquired resistance to the inhibitor. In this proposal, we seek to understand the biological\nunderpinnings of DOT1L inhibitor resistance and develop a novel class of small molecule DOT1L degraders to\novercome resistance. In Specific Aim 1, we seek to understand the mechanisms of resistance through detailed\nstudies of chromatin structure and gene expression following the development of acquired resistance to DOT1L\ninhibitor therapy. We will also investigate the non-enzymatic role of DOT1L in MLL-r leukemia and define\ndependencies acquired in the resistant state. In Specific Aim 2, we will lead a chemistry and chemical biology\ncampaign and develop an assay platform for the identification and optimization of the first small molecule\ndegraders of endogenous DOT1L protein. In Specific Aim 3, we will utilize our cell culture and patient-derived\nxenograft models of MLL-r leukemia to explore the impact of DOT1L degradation on gene expression and tumor\nprogression while driving hit-to-lead optimization of DOT1L degraders that can prompt clinical investigation. We\nwill also test pharmacological hypotheses regarding combinatorial drug action with DOT1L degraders in\npredictive human models of MLL-r leukemia. We expect these aims to bring new more efficacious, less toxic\ntherapies to children and adults diagnosed with this devastating disease.

project	3R01CA175397-07S1	10213480	2021	A vicious cycle of pyroptotic cancer cells and fibroblasts fuels chemoresistance	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARYTO APPLICATION\nThis application is in direct response to the RFA-CA-19-049 “Revision Applications for Mechanisms of Cancer\nDrug Resistance”, to investigate a non-classical mechanism driving the chemoresistance of locally advanced\nbladder carcinomas. Advanced bladder cancer claims approximately 18,000 deaths annually in the United\nStates; yet, funding and research devoted to this cancer-type are significantly under-proportioned. A major\nclinical setback for bladder cancer treatment lies in the poor patient response towards chemotherapy with\ntreatments providing only a dismal 5% improvement in overall survival. Thus, the goal of this application aims\nto understand the less-studied biology, i.e., cancer cell-extrinsic mechanisms, causing chemotherapy drug\nresistance. The success of chemotherapy is long thought to depend on its direct cytotoxic effects upon tumor\ncells and this has attracted much research interest in the past decades. However, there is growing evidence,\nas shown by our own research and others, that successful chemotherapy is also dependent on: 1)\nfeedforward signals between dying cancer cells and the stromal fibroblast microenvironment, and 2) the\nactive role(s) of collagens secreted from cancer associated fibroblasts to serve as a protective niche for\nchemoresistant cancer cells. Our proposal will leverage existing patient-derived cancer associated fibroblasts\nand patient-derived primary tumor cultures/xenografts developed from the parent grant NCI CA175397,\nwhich allow us to venture into a new research direction: i.e., how cell death associated release of extracellular\nfactors impacts the fibrotic environment, consequently serves as a protective niche to fuel chemoresistant\ncancer cells? This proposal is innovative to elucidate the intricate feedforward loops between dying cancer\ncells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and residual cancer stem cells during the emergence of\nchemoresistance. The success of this study will be innovative and impactful to challenge the current\nparadigm that chemotherapy drug resistance is primarily driven by cancer cell-intrinsic properties. Indeed,\nsuccess of our proposal will establish an original concept: Dying cancer cells provide feedforward signals to\ncultivate a collagen-rich fibrotic environment, consequently initiating a “vicious cycle” of epithelial-stromal\nfeedforward signaling loop to fuel chemoresistance. Also, our proposal will provide new insights into the\nrational design of future intervention strategies to “break” this vicious cycle, and thus, improve chemotherapy\nresponse. Such a concept likely extends beyond bladder carcinomas into other cancer types.	3-Dimensional;ABL2 gene;Amino Acids;Apoptosis;Automobile Driving;Biological;Biology;CASP1 gene;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Patient;Cell Death;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Survival;Cessation of life;Chemoresistance;Cisplatin;Citric Acid Cycle;Clinical;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Collagen Fiber;Collagen Receptors;Communication;DDR1 gene;Drug resistance;Environment;Enzymes;Epithelial;Epithelial-Stromal Communication;Evaluation;Fibroblasts;Flow Cytometry;Funding;Future;Genetic;Goals;HMGB1 gene;Hydroxyproline;In Vitro;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-1 beta;Intervention;Knock-out;Label;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder;Mediating;Modeling;Nutrient;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Population;Population Heterogeneity;Primary Neoplasm;Proline;Proline Dehydrogenase;Property;Publishing;Research;Residual Cancers;Residual Tumors;Residual state;Role;Signal Transduction;Source;Survival Rate;System;Therapeutic;Treatment Failure;Tumor Tissue;United States;Validation;Xenograft procedure;bladder Carcinoma;cancer cell;cancer drug resistance;cancer stem cell;cancer therapy;cancer type;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;cohort;cytotoxic;design;extracellular;gemcitabine;implantation;improved;in vivo;innovation;insight;interest;multiplexed imaging;neoplastic cell;parent grant;patient response;progenitor;receptor;refractory cancer;response;src Homology Region 2 Domain;standard of care;success;tool;tumor heterogeneity;uptake	CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER	LOS ANGELES	CA	UNITED STATES	Keith Syson SYSON Chan	DCB	Elizabeth G Snyderwine	390397	390397	2021-04-22T04:00:00Z	2013-09-30T04:00:00Z	2025-04-30T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-19-049	Moonshot

project	1R01CA239701-01A1	9995648	2020	Admixture analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in African American children: the ADMIRAL Study	Grant	Abstract\nChildren with substantial African ancestry have long been known to have half or less the rate of B-cell acute\nlymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) than do children with other continental ancestries. This is true both in\ninternational comparisons of rates of ALL in African nations to those elsewhere, and in comparing rate of B-ALL\nin African-American (AA) children to that in European-American (EA) children in the United States. The inverse\nassociation of African ancestry with incidence of B-ALL is independent of established perinatal risk factors for\nthe disease. Moreover, AA children have lower incidence despite having greater exposure to many putatively\ncausal environmental risk factors for B-ALL than do EA children. Common genetic variants established by\ngenomewide association studies incompletely explain the deficit of B-ALL in AA children, suggesting\nundiscovered contributing genetic factors may be detected by admixture mapping. We have assembled existing\nDNA samples and data for 930 B-ALL patients with AA ancestry and will additionally accrue ~590 over the life\nof the project. We will conduct admixture mapping in the assembled group of patients to detect new genetic loci\nand new variants at established loci associated with occurrence of B-ALL. In addition, we will examine admixture\nin association with clinical characteristics at diagnosis and survival. Candidate genes/variants will be functionally\nevaluated through both in silico and in vitro techniques. The proposed research will potentially answer a long-\nstanding mystery by revealing critical genes or loci that explain the comparative deficit of B-ALL in AA compared\nto EA children. In addition, we may uncover genes or variants associated with the worse characteristics at\npresentation in AA patients as well as with worse survival, which will indicate avenues for improving outcome\namong AA children.

project	3UG1CA189828-07S1	10230790	2020	ECOG-ACRIN NCORP Research Base	Grant	Project Summary\nThe ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (EA) is dedicated to decreasing the burden of cancer. EA\nis a vibrant member of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and the NCI Community Oncology\nResearch Program (NCORP), focused on practice-changing clinical and translational research across\nthe cancer care continuum from prevention and early detection, through the management of advanced\ndisease and its impact. As an NCORP Research Base, EA has engaged community providers and\nresearchers to develop a robust research portfolio that spans Cancer Prevention, Cancer Control, and\nCancer Care Delivery, aligned with the overall scientific themes of precision oncology, immuno-oncology,\nreducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and leveraging novel biomarker platforms. Cancer control\ntrials examine and intervene on challenges associated with cancer and treatment-related symptoms and\nconcerns. EA's portfolio of therapeutic trials yield opportunities to apply patient-reported outcomes\nmeasurement science to quantify health-related quality of life, symptoms, and domains most relevant to\npatients in the context of evolving treatment paradigms. Behavioral and biomarker-driven symptom\ninterventions aim to improve quality of life and cancer survivorship. Cardiotoxicity research aims to\nmitigate risk through quantifying cardiotoxicity associated with treatment, identifying groups at risk, and\nadvancing interventions to reduce risk. Prevention trials embrace the NCI's broad definition of prevention\nto include primary prevention, cancer screening, and secondary prevention and aim to identify high risk\ngroups for precision prevention strategies. Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) examines the\ncomplex interactions between patient, provider, and system factors that influence care, and adapts and\nevaluates interventions in heterogenous community oncology practices. Health equity research\npermeates EA science through embedding disparities-related research questions that span EA activities,\nadopting a broad view of underserved populations including adolescents and young adults, the elderly,\nracial and ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities and rural residents. Key collaborations with\ncommunity-based oncology programs will ensure access to EA NCTN and NCORP trials in communities\nwhere patients receive their care. EA provides access to existing NCI-funded resources and a network\nof >10000 physicians, scientists, nurses, research associates (RAs), statisticians, biomedical information\ntechnologists, and patient advocates across approximately 600 institutions and organizations. EA has\nprovided scientific leadership in the NCORP community through advancing rigorous, practice-changing\nclinical trials and translational research in cancer control, prevention and care delivery and is well poised\nto continue to support the NCI's mission to engage community-based diverse populations in cancer\nresearch.

project	3U24CA237719-02S1	10228464	2020	Standardized and Genome-Wide Clinical Interpretation of Complex Genotypes for Cancer Precision Medicine	Grant	Project Summary\nClinical interpretation of genomic variants in childhood cancers is heavily reliant upon our ability to precisely\nlocate and apply structured biomedical knowledge. This exercise is uniquely challenging for pediatric cancers.\nEven compared to other cancers, childhood cancers are highly heterogeneous, often involving genes not\ntypically attributed to adult cancers and often involving complex, large-scale variations. Childhood cancers also\ntend to arise in less differentiated cell lineages, progress rapidly, and have much lower incidence and mutation\nburden. These characteristics are compounded by unique clinical challenges related to developmental factors\nand treatment-related secondary cancers, resulting in significantly fewer targeted therapy options available to\npediatric patients. These challenges have led to a significant under-representation of genes and variants\nrelevant to childhood cancers in public cancer databases and knowledgebases. Thus, there is a critical unmet\nneed for structured genetic variant level data in publicly accessible databases which document diagnostic,\nprognostic and therapeutic biomarkers for childhood cancers. The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI)\nfocuses on accelerating research on childhood cancers by developing and enhancing tools and methods to\nextract knowledge and enable sharing of childhood cancer data. The CIViC resource is a knowledge extraction\nand data sharing platform for clinical interpretation of cancer variants. Expert curators extract knowledge and\nevidence from the literature to produce rigorous and high-quality assertions following widely-recognized clinical\nvariant classification guidelines. The variant classifications are made freely available in the public domain and\nare widely utilized in clinical workflows. However, to date, CIViC knowledge curation has focused almost\nentirely on adult malignancies. Other key variant knowledgebases either do not provide clinical relevance, lack\nchildhood-specific interpretations, and/or have restrictive licenses. We propose to close this knowledge gap in\nCIViC by forging new and expanded collaboration with pediatric cancer experts, and building domain-specific\ntools for curation and dissemination of high-quality variant interpretations for childhood cancers. The CIViC\nvisual interface will be adapted to better support curation and dissemination of childhood cancer variants\ninterpretations. A modification of our existing natural language processing approach will be used to prioritize\nliterature relevant to childhood cancers and an expert panel will prioritize childhood variants and subsequently\nperform and also evaluate curation on taskforce calls. Based on the experience and products of this work, we\nwill develop childhood-cancer-specific curation guidelines and conduct pilot development of a childhood cancer\nvariant panel that is capable of evolving rapidly as childhood cancer variant knowledge accumulates in CIViC.

project	1R01CA222518-01A1	9973837	2020	Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis in AMKL	Grant	!\nProject Summary/Abstract\nFundamental analysis of the mechanisms of leukemogenesis is required in order to develop optimized\ntreatment approaches. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant RNA modification, plays key roles in\nRNA metabolism, transcript stability, and translation efficiency. Aberrant regulation of m6A writers and erasers\ncontributes to leukemogenesis, though the exact mechanisms how the methyltransferase machinery is altered\nin leukemia remains to be shown. Mutations in methyltransferase writers have not been identified to date, with\none exception: in the recurrent t(1;22) translocation in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) a component\nof the m6A writer machinery, RBM15, is fused with MKL1, a transcriptional cofactor of serum response factor\n(SRF). Understanding the mechanism by which the RBM15-MKL1 (RM) fusion protein causes leukemia will shed\nlight on the role of disordered m6A RNA methylation in leukemogenesis, specifically AMKL but also AML and to\ncancer in general. We hypothesize that for RM-associated AMKL to develop, the MKL1 domain aberrantly targets\nRBM15 activity to sites of SRF binding and that RBM15 recruits the m6A writer complex to associated RNAs,\naltering m6A mRNA methylation and expression of genes that are required for transformation and/or are\nimportant for megakaryocyte fate commitment and maturation. We propose focused, unbiased genome-wide\nstudies to determine how the m6A epitranscriptome and the SRF transcriptional networks are coopted in RBM15-\nMKL1 AMKL. The functional effects of candidate target genes common to the genomic approaches (m6A RNA\nimmunoprecipitation, chromatin mapping, RNA stability assays, and mapping of the translatome) as well as the\nrelevance of critical domains in RM-mediated leukemogenesis will be tested with assays of growth, differentiation\nand oncogene dependence in RM-induced murine AMKL as well as primary human AMKL patient derived\nxenotransplants (PDX). The studies are highly clinically relevant as they address a unique mechanism causative\nof AMKL via comprehensive analysis of fundamental biologic mechanisms, and will reveal previously unidentified\nregulation of the epitranscriptome that may be a novel shared oncogenic mechanism in AML and other cancers.\nThe proposed approaches are multifaceted, using cell lines as well as genetically engineered animal models,\nand primary human and murine leukemia samples. The studies will contribute to our understanding of\nleukemogenesis by elucidating the direct role of a component of the m6A RNA methylase complex in leukemia\nshedding light on the broader role of m6A mRNA modifications in AML.\n!

project	2UM1CA081457-21	10055934	2020	Pediatric Brain Tumor ConsortiumA multi-institutional consortium devoted to novel phase I and II clinical evaluations of experimental treatment approaches for pediatric CNS tumors.	Grant	PBTC Project Summary/Abstract\nThe primary goal of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) is to rapidly and effectively\ncontribute to the understanding and cure of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors\nthrough innovative, multidisciplinary and multi-institutional prospective clinical trials. PBTC clinical\ntrial development is not only based upon known prognostic factors but also upon an evolving\nunderstanding of pediatric brain tumor biology. The PBTC will continue to utilize innovative study\ndesigns and analyses based on state-of-the-art statistical science. Novel clinical trials will\nincorporate relevant correlative pharmacology, biology, neuroimaging, immunologic and\ngenomics studies in an effort to define and integrate these modalities into a better understanding\nof pediatric CNS tumors. These goals will be accomplished through a close and continued\npartnership with the member institutions' basic and translational scientists as well as the clinical\ntrial experts. In addition, the PBTC welcomes partnerships with investigators outside the\nconsortium providing scientific, laboratory and regulatory support for innovative and high priority\nclinical trials. The PBTC will continue to maintain and grow its relationship with the National\nCancer Institute (NCI) and its large network of adult and pediatric groups as well as with\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. One of the most important goals of the PBTC is to\nsuccessfully complete focused phase I and II clinical trials of novel agents and treatment\napproaches that can be then be translated into large prospective phase II and III studies overseen\nby the Children's Oncology Group (COG). The overarching long-term goal is to improve survival\noutcome and quality of life for children with CNS tumor diagnoses that so often lead to high\nmorbidity and mortality such as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, high-grade gliomas, infant\nembryonal tumors, refractory medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and low-grade gliomas. To this\nend, the PBTC will continue to focus upon introducing novel molecularly-targeted agents via\ninnovative trials to assess the presence of the target in tumor and surrogate tissue, evaluate the\nability of the agent to down-regulate its signaling target and better correlate pharmacokinetic and\npharmacodynamic endpoints with toxicities and clinical responses. The PBTC will also continue\nto explore therapeutic opportunities for pediatric brain tumors through immunotherapeutic\ninterventions as well as via local delivery of treatments. By focusing on the most common solid\ntumor in children which also accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths in\npediatrics, the PBTC will continue to support the NCI's mission of helping all people live longer,\nhealthier lives through its contributions to cancer research and identification of better treatments.

project	5UM1CA228823-03	9983644	2020	Children's Oncology Group Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trial Network	Grant	The mission of the Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trials Network (PEP-CTN) is to identify and\ndevelop effective new agents for children and adolescents with cancer, through rational and\nefficient clinical and laboratory research. PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative\ngenomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the\ndisposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer.\nAnnually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto\nclinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core premier pediatric oncology sites throughout\nthe country. The network institutions are selected through a peer review process, and serve as\na national and international model for new agent development in pediatric oncology. The PEP-\nCTN will leverage the database infrastructure and resources of the parent Children's Oncology\nGroup while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure to ensure rapid\ndevelopment, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical trials.\nThe PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology,\npharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems\nto facilitate the transfer of response and correlative imaging studies for central review and\nanalyses.\nThe PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer\nagents into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To\nexpeditiously obtain preliminary efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and\npilot studies in order to inform tumor specific trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To\nperform genomic analyses, including single gene studies or gene panels, to identify appropriate\npatients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor\ncharacteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole exome\nsequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints,\nincluding circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities,\ninto early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect\non tumors.. Development of targeted therapy for childhood cancer is a high priority as it offers the\nprospect of more efficacious and less toxic therapeutics.

The goal of the Knight is to perform cancer-focused research and to convert these\nfindings into treatments and prevention strategies to improve outcomes for cancer patients. The OHSU Knight\nCancer Institute has 139 members who belong to four scientific programs - Cancer Biology, Translational\nOncology, Quantitative Oncology, and Cancer Prevention and Control and utilize six well-established shared\nresources - Flow Cytometry, Proteomics, Advanced Multiscale Microscopy, Integrated Genomics, BioLibrary &\nPathology, and Biostatistics.\nThe 139 Knight members are supported by $87.6 million in total extramural funding, $42.9 million of which is\nfrom the NCI. In the current funding period, members have published 1,139 cancer focused, peer-reviewed\npublications, of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 15% inter-programmatic, and 62% externally collaborative.\nIn 2015 a total of 481 patients were enrolled on therapeutic treatment trials, representing over 10% of our new\npatient population.\nOHSU is the only academic medical center in Oregon and the Knight Cancer Institute is the only NCI-designated\ncancer center in the state. The Knight's catchment area is defined as the entire state of Oregon. Our research\nefforts are targeted to populations and cancers that are unique to our catchment area and includes evaluating\npopulations in our catchment area that are more likely to diagnosed with late-stage cancers. Serving as the\nadvanced oncology care facility for the state, the Knight brings depth and breadth to basic laboratory research;\nclinical research, including early phase clinical trials; and prevention, control, and population-based research\nwith training programs for cancer researchers and health care professionals.\nIn the current funding period we have recruited 32 new investigators, including four Associate Directors,\ncompletely restructured the leadership committees and the programmatic structure of the Knight to facilitate\nintra- and inter-programmatic interactions and to accelerate progress in achieving our goals. This has led to a\nsignificant increase in cancer focus, an increase in NCI funding, and enhanced collaborations as demonstrated\nby publications and collaborative grants. Given our growth and accomplishments in the current funding period,\nwe request consideration for continued funding and feel we are well positioned for consideration of\ncomprehensive status.

project	3P30CA014089-45S6	10261622	2020	USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (Core) Grant	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Molecular Genetics Program has been continuously approved through the NCI CCSG since the USC Norris first received NCI designation over 35 years ago. This Program has always been distinguished nationally for its strength in DNA replication and DNA repair, with an emphasis on applying discoveries toward cancer chemotherapy. During the project period, Preet Chaudhary joined Michael Lieber as Co-Leader to add depth in translation and oversee a new theme on the molecular genetics of cancers associated with infection by HHV8, including the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of these cancers. The Program has three integrated aims: 1) DNA replication, cell cycle, and cell proliferation in genetic instability; 2) DNA repair and recombination in genetic instability; and 3) viral oncogenesis with an emphasis on HHV8. Lymphoid malignancies are used as a disease model used by Program members for all three aims. Members continue to be highly interactive within and across themes and across program boundaries. The 39 Program members, who come from three schools and 13 departments, have $11.4M in peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of which 18% is from NCI, 61% from other NIH sources, and 8% from other peer-reviewed funding sources. The Program is highly productive with 439 publications of which 21% are inter-programmatic, 15% intra-programmatic and 25% inter-institutional. Program Leaders organize retreats and mini-symposia several times per year to cross-fertilize research within and across Programs while remaining watchful to ensure a high level of member crosstalk. This has led to high success in securing new P01s that are intra- and inter-programmatic, while also cross-cutting thematically. Examples include renewal of an NCI P01 on understanding human DNA polymerase active sites and development of new chemotherapeutics (Goodman, McKenna, Warshel), and a new NCI P01 on viral oncogenesis by KSHV (HHV8) (Jung, Feng, Gao). Members have been particularly successful in seeking new cancer drug therapies, which has been achieved with the Translational and Clinical Sciences Program.

For more than 4 decades, we have pursued this mission with the support of a Cancer\nCenter Support Grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We remain the only NCI-designated Cancer\nCenter that is dedicated solely to the research and treatment of pediatric malignancies. As such, we serve as a\nnational and international resource for health care providers, children with cancer, and their families. Through\nthe support of the American Lebanese and Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), a separate organization whose\nsole purpose is to raise money in support of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), we receive robust\ninstitutional support. A total of 75% percent of institutional space and annual budget are invested in the SJCCC.\nWe propose 5 multidisciplinary research Programs that are organized with the specific intent of translating basic\nscience discoveries into curative therapies for children with cancer, while minimizing long-term side effects: our\nCancer Biology Program (CBP), which embeds basic cancer research within the heart of the SJCCC, facilitating\ndirect interaction with the disease-oriented Programs and the major laboratory resources in the Center; our 3\ndisease-oriented Programs, focused on innovative translational and clinical research in Developmental Biology\nand Solid Tumors (DBSTP), Hematological Malignancies (HMP), and Neurobiology and Brain Tumors (NBTP);\nand our Cancer Control and Survivorship Program (CCSP), which strives to translate discoveries into effective\nstrategies to avert or mitigate treatment-related complications and improve the quality of life for survivors of\npediatric cancer. Research by our 114 members is supported by 9 Shared Resources, 1 developing Shared\nResource, and an extraordinary clinical research infrastructure. During the previous funding period, a new\nDirector was recruited and a new 8-goal strategic plan was launched for the SJCCC. A total of 32,522 clinical\ntrial enrollments occurred at the Center during the current funding period, of which 60% were to SJCCC\ninvestigator-initiated studies. External peer-reviewed trials, many which are SJCCC member-led, accounted for\nanother 38% of enrollments. In the last 12 months we were supported by $34.3 million (direct cost) in extramural\nfunding ($30.3.5 million peer-reviewed; $3.9 million non–peer-reviewed). Since the prior renewal, SJCCC\nmembers published more than 2,100 manuscripts, which includes a marked increase in publications in the\nhighest-level journals. Our campus has grown in size by 23% and SJCRH and ALSAC have committed to more\nthan $150 million in new investment to support the SJCCC strategic plan. Despite strategically reducing our\nmembership by 27% to more tightly focus on cancer research and our strategic plan, NCI funding has increased\nby 9.3%, other NIH funding by 9.5%, and our other peer-reviewed funding has increased by 34%.

project	3P30CA016058-44S3	10240786	2020	Cancer Center Support Grant	Grant	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Control (CC) Program at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC), led by Electra D. Paskett, PhD, MSPH and Mary Ellen Wewers, RN, PHD, MPH, has 52 members from 19 OSU departments within the OSU Colleges of Medicine, Public Health, Arts and Sciences, Law, Nursing, Education and Human Ecology, Dentistry, and Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, as well as Nationwide Children's Hospital and Cincinnati Children's Hospital. Program members provide a wealth of behavioral, basic, clinical, policy, outcomes, and social scientific knowledge and expertise not only to the CC Program, but to the OSUCCC as a whole. The overall CC Program goal is to conduct research to reduce the incidence, mortality and morbidity of cancer, which is accomplished by employing a transdisciplinary research team approach. The Specific Aims of the CC Program are to: 1) Identify molecular, genetic, and behavioral factors related to cancer incidence and mortality; 2) Develop and test behavioral interventions to prevent or detect cancer early; and, 3) Assess and intervene on issues of cancer survivorship. An additional developing aim of the CC Program is to address policy in relation to cancer prevention, detection, and care. Within these aims, research focuses on cross-cutting themes including underserved/minority populations within our catchment area, communication research, tobacco use and toxicity (including regulatory science), and behavioral strategies that capitalize on our members' strengths, such as epidemiology, biology and behavior. The program now has 2 NCI P50-funded Centers, both showcasing not only our multi-level focus but also the transition from observational to interventional studies. In addition, many of our interventions, e.g., Patient Navigation and Bio-Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Stress after Breast Cancer, have been incorporated into clinical care. Moreover, our research has contributed to policy changes, most notably the establishment of a smoke-free campus at OSU. During this past funding period (2009 - 2014), the Program members published a total 611 articles in peer-reviewed journals of which 32% have intra-programmatic collaboration, 20% have inter-programmatic collaborations, and 404 (66%) of the publications represent multi-institutional collaborations. Many of these publications fall within each of these categories bringing the total collaborative publications to 85%. CC Program funding stands at $6.8M of which $6.2M is peer-reviewed funding and of that, $3.9M (63%) is NCI funding. CC Program investigators have enrolled 9,205 participants to research studies over the last 5 years, 64% to externally peer-reviewed studies and 34% to institutional studies, 1.2% to cooperative trial group studies and 0.8% to industry studies. Of these, 6,964 (76%) were enrolled on interventional studies and 2,241 (24%) on non-interventional studies. Future goals focus on increasing research in: 1) policy, allowing us to take advantage of health care policy initiatives; 2) molecular and genetic epidemiology and 3) patient outcomes, fostering more inter-programmatic research with clinicians.

project	3P30CA016056-43S5	10240758	2020	Roswell Park Cancer Center Support Grant	Grant	The sole mission of the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center is cancer research, treatment, prevention\nand education. The Center devotes all of its resources, personnel, and facilities to supporting its cancer\nmission The Cancer Center which is in its 41th year of funding, is currently organized around 5 research\nprograms, 15 shared resources, and a clinical trial infrastructure that prioritizes investigator-initiated and\ninnovative clinical trials that are a product of the research programs. The Cancer Center supports 143\nmembers across multiple disciplines and has recruited 139 new faculty since the previous review with 48 of\nthem new members of the CCSG. All of the members actively participate in CCSG program activities and have\nbrought strength in collaborative and translational project areas. Our cancer-relevant direct grant funding is\ncurrently $52.4M with $17.5M in NCI funding and we have seen an increase in program/multi PI type grants\nthat underscores our commitment to collaborative research. We have increased our focus on our community\noutreach and engagement component with more funded grants in this area since the previous review and we\nhave an enhanced approach to our community and catchment area needs. Accrual to interventional\ninvestigator- initiated clinical trials (externally peer-funded plus institutional) arising from our own science was\n69% (592 out of a total of 858 accruals). For interventional-treatment trials, almost half (49%) of the accruals\nwere for investigator-initiated clinical trials. For non-interventional trials, almost all of the accruals (98%) were\nfrom investigator-initiated clinical trials. The specific aims of Roswell Park over the next 5 years are as follows:\n1) To be a leader in the development of innovative therapeutic approaches by building on our existing\nstrengths in tumor immunology and immunotherapy, genomic medicine and molecular epidemiology; 2) To\nenhance collaborative efforts between basic, clinical and population scientists toward the discovery of\ninnovative approaches to prevent and treat cancer; 3) To train the next generation of scientists through\ninnovative oncology-focused programs that continue to develop translational opportunities across the clinic, the\nbasic science laboratory and population science areas and 4) To focus on the needs of our catchment area of\nWestern New York (WNY) through research and outreach using effective strategies for prevention, treatment\nand survivorship. Roswell Park continues to play a primary role in discovery and innovation in basic science\nfindings that enable us to deliver the best cancer care to our patients in New York State, around the country\nand around the world.

project	3P30CA177558-08S2	10230502	2020	University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\n The Markey Cancer Center (MCC) was established more than 35 years ago as a university-based matrix\ncancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK), Kentucky's flagship institution of higher education. MCC is\nthe only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center in Kentucky, a state of 4.4 million that leads\nthe nation for all-site cancer incidence and mortality and serves as the MCC's catchment area. Over $347M in\nstate, institutional, and philanthropic investment since recruitment of MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (CS) in\n2009 have supported significant research and resource expansion, enabling substantial new faculty\nrecruitment, program development, renovation of clinical and shared resource space, and new state-of-the art\ninstrumentation, as well as statewide education and community outreach efforts. The 119 MCC members draw\nfrom 28 departments in 8 UK colleges, with 28 new faculty recruited since 2013. Cancer-relevant research\nfunding to MCC investigators exceeds $38.7M in total annual costs, an increase of $10.3M since 2012. Over\nthe last 4 years, 9,357 subjects have been accrued to interventional trials. Members have published 851\ncancer-focused publications since 2013, reflecting 28% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-programmatic, and 58%\ninter-institutional collaborations. Research is conducted within 4 MCC Research Programs: Cancer Cell\nBiology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational\nTherapeutics; and Genomic Instability, Epigenetics and Metabolism. Five Shared Resource Facilities (SRFs)\nfacilitate cutting-edge research by providing robust infrastructure for specialized expertise and advanced\nmethods: Biospecimen Procurement and Translational Pathology; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer\nResearch Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Redox Metabolism. Two new SRFs (Behavioral\nand Community-Based Research and Oncogenomics) are in development. Significant achievements include:\ndevelopment of an NCI-sponsored early therapeutics program, including an active Molecular Tumor Board and\nPrecision Medicine Center; expansion of the MCC Network from 8 to 24 sites; establishment of a regional\nMetabolomics Center (U24); award of 2 new cancer-related centers – a Center of Biomedical Research\nExcellence (COBRE) in Cancer and Metabolism and a Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental\nSciences; and expansion of community outreach/education initiatives across the state. MCC research focuses\non Kentucky's most serious cancer burdens with emphasis on the “distressed” Appalachian Kentucky region,\nwhere cancer incidence and mortality rates surpass those for the entire state. The MCC brings unique basic,\nclinical, and population research strengths to this mission. These strengths are integral to all MCC programs\nand collectively provide robust capacity to deliver transformative interventional research to an important\nunderserved priority population, thereby contributing to national efforts to conquer cancer through discovery\nand clinical translation, cancer prevention, and community outreach.

project	3P30CA006516-55S9	10243124	2020	Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center	Grant	Overall\nProject Summary / Abstract\nNow in its 17th year of operation, Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) was the first consortium\nmodel, NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the country. The consortium is comprised of 1,100\nmembers from five principal Harvard-affiliated hospitals and two Harvard health science schools: Beth Israel\nDeaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston Children's Hospital (BCH, Brigham and Women's Hospital\n(BWH), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Harvard Medical School (HMS), Harvard T. H. Chan School of\nPublic Health (HSPH), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).\nThe progress presented in this proposal has required DF/HCC leadership, its combined resources, and, most\nimportantly, its consortium structure. The overarching scientific vision is to unite the members. The research of\nthe Center is carried out in Research Programs that cross both scientific and institutional boundaries. In\naddition, the Center supports Shared Resources dedicated to enhancing scientific efficiency available to all\nCenter members. The unified clinical research infrastructure has made it easier for members to conduct clinical\ntrials across the Center. Indirect indications of scientific progress are the substantial growth in the Center's\ngrant portfolio, from $233 million in 1999 to $406 million in 2004, to $623 million in 2009, to $683M and the\naward of multiple translational grants that transcend organizational boundaries (e.g., SPOREs, SCORs, P01s,\nU01s, and SU2Cs). There is also an array of hypothesis-driven, Early Phase (pilot, I, I-II), and proof-of-concept\ntrials, made possible through the development and execution of the Center, that are conducted daily across the\nconsortium.

To better understand whether PFOA and other PFAS are ovarian and endometrial carcinogens, we propose to conduct a nested case-control study of pre-diagnostic circulating PFAS serum levels among 299 ovarian and 409 endometrial cancer cases with a shared control group within the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial. This will be the largest study of PFOA exposure and ovarian and endometrial cancer risk to date and the first to investigate their associations with other PFAS. It will also be the first study to directly assess exposure to these chemicals through the measurement of pre-diagnostic concentrations in serum. Given these strengths, this study will greatly inform future evaluations of the carcinogenicity of these chemicals.

project	75N91020F00125-0-0-1	10281197	2020	Strategic Support Services for Advancement of Pediatric Oncology Data Sharing and Re-use for the National Cancer Institute (NCI)	Contract	In the United States in 2019, an estimated 11,060 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed among children from birth to 14 years, and about 1,190 children are expected to die from the disease. Although cancer death rates for this age group have declined by 65 percent from 1970 to 2016, cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease among children. NCI supports a broad range of research to better understand the causes, biology, and patterns of childhood cancers, and to identify the best ways to successfully treat children with cancer. This research generates significant amounts of data, the value of which would be magnified if this information was findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. At present, there is a large number of pediatric cancer data sets, but many are hard to locate, and harder to search for – a situation which squanders the possibilities for scientific advancement through re-use available within this corpus. This data is composed of a variety of useful data types, including but not limited to -omics, treatment and outcome, demographics, and clinical data. NCI funds many, but not all data repositories. Research could be accelerated by making these data sets easier to find and reuse. This would also be of considerable benefit to other stakeholders. To improve the current situation and endeavor to address this siloed data situation, NCI requires the support of the Health FFRDC Operator to provide evaluative, design, and prototyping services, supporting the goal of developing a catalogue of data resources. At the end of this effort, the Health FFRDC Operator shall transition all materials and outputs back to NCI. The expected end result is that NCI is positioned to proceed confidently with the development and sustainable deployment of a pediatric oncology research data catalogue with scientifically relevant query capabilities by themselves or with vendor support.\n\nThe Health Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) Operator shall provide a range of support services required to plan for, develop, and transition a prototype\npediatric oncology data catalogue capability that would better support the needs of the pediatric oncology research community and other relevant stakeholders.
