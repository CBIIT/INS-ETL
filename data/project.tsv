project	3P01AI118688-02S1	3P01AI118688-02S1	9568131	2017	Disruption of T cell tolerance in type 1 diabetes	Project Summary/Abstract\nAutoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes arise through a breakdown in immune tolerance. We have now\ncome to understand that immune tolerance consists of a multi-layered network that keeps such untoward\nresponses in check. In this program project grant, three complementary teams will be working together to\nfurther unravel how these checkpoints operate to improve our understanding of autoimmunity and ultimately\nimprove its treatment. This program project will have three highly collaborative and interactive projects headed\nby Drs. Mark Anderson (Project 1), Jeff Bluestone (Project 2) and John Kappler (Project 3) along with two\nscientific cores (Animal core and Molecular core). The major themes of the grant are:\n1. The impact of central thymic tolerance on the T effector and Treg repertoire in T1D..\n2. Insulin as a critical self-antigen specificity for both T effectors and T regulatory cells in T1D.\n3. Peptide specificity of Tregulatory cells in T1D\n4. Using peptide binding characteristics of islet antigens to improve bioassays and tolerance methods.\nThe long term objectives of this work is to improve our understanding of how T cell tolerance is controlled and\nthe further refining the specificity of the autoreactive T cell response in type 1 diabetes. The investigators will\nbe using state of the art tools in both animal models and in human subjects with type 1 diabetes. Results of\nthese studies will help further refine our understanding of autoimmunity and help improve methods for its\ntreatment and diagnosis.

The goal of our Program is to advance the pre-clinical\nscience of NSCLC therapeutics. During the current funding period, our Program has advanced inhibitors of\nEGFR, promoting the pre-clinical development of osimertinib and related molecules, of TBK1, and of DDR2. In\nits next 5 years, our Program aims to develop compounds that will lead to more effective treatments for\nNSCLC and prevent or overcome resistance to existing and future targeted therapies.\n To accomplish these goals, the Program seeks to achieve the following overall aims via 3 inter-related and\ncollaborative Projects and 4 intellectually driven Shared Resource Cores.\n--Overall Aim 1. Develop inhibitors and/or degraders focused on mutant EGFR, KRAS signaling effectors, and\nmechanisms of transcriptional adaptation in non-small cell lung cancer.\n--Overall Aim 2. Characterize these compounds and their targets pharmacologically using genetically defined\ncellular and animal models of lung cancer.\n--Overall Aim 3. Develop and assess combinations of these potent and selective novel agents with existing\ntherapies to prevent and overcome therapeutic resistance.\n These aims leverage innovations in chemistry and structural biology—the development of allosteric kinase\ninhibitors and selective degraders—coupled with expertise in lung cancer biology, lung cancer cellular and\nanimal modeling, and functional genomic approaches to understanding pathways, through the Projects and\nCores. The broad aims will be implemented with three focused projects aimed at developing inhibitors of key\npathways in NSCLC as well as over-arching mechanisms of resistance:\n--Project 1: Development of pharmacologic strategies to degrade mutant EGFR.\n--Project 2: Identification of combination therapy for KRAS-driven lung cancers.\n--Project 3: Targeting transcriptional mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.\n Each Project and the overall Program is based on the innovative, technology-driven Cores, each led by\nfaculty with expertise in the specific areas.\nCore A: Medicinal Chemistry.\nCore B: Structure and Biochemistry.\nCore C: Animal Modeling and Preclinical Therapeutics.\nCore D: Program Administration.\n The integration of the three Projects and the four Cores will enable an effective co-ordination to meet\nProgram aims by cross-fertilization of lung cancer focus and technological expertise.

During the prior 4 years of funding period, we have 1. defined the role of transplant in the era of\nnovel agents; 2 Established the role of molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) in myeloma. 3. Established\nthe role of both MRI and PET/CT in diagnosis and follow up of MM patients. 4. Identified and Validated number\nof novel targets. and 5. Defined patterns of clonal evolution and mutational signatures being utilized in MM.\nOur program has also developed novel targeted sequencing platform, developed a pipeline to identify\nmutations using RNA-seq, and developed a publicly available data analysis portal (Canevolve.org). Building on\nthese advances, The overall specific objectives of the program are 1) To determine whether maintenance can\nbe tailored based upon MRD status and whether achieving MRD negative status provides superior outcome In\na 1260 patient randomized clinical study and to develop novel risk model (Project 1). Clinically annotated\npatient samples from this clinical trial will be utilized to study genomic and epigenomic correlates; 2) To identify\nthe spectrum of epigenomic lesions and enhancer dependencies that underlie pathogenesis, progression, and\nclinical outcome in MM. (Project 2). New clinically-relevant epigenomic-centered targets identified will be\nvalidated further; 3) To identify and validate the molecular circuits/loops responsible for continued MM cell\ngrowth and develop strategies to interrupt these loops as a novel therapeutic approach. (Project 3). New\ntargeted therapeutic agents will be translated to clinical trials to improve patient outcome; and 4) To define the\nimpact of therapy on clonal evolution and identify mediators of genomic instability underlying disease prognosis\nand progression in MM (Project 4). New clinically relevant processes identified will be used to understand\nprocess of progression. These 4 projects will be supported by Administrative and Communication Core (1),\nClinical and Tissue Core (2); Genomics Core (3); Genomic Sequencing Core (4) and Biostatistical and\nBioinformatics Cores (5). This unique collaborative effort will improve our understanding of myeloma biology\nand define a new treatment paradigm for this presently incurable disease.

project	1P01CA210944-01	1P01CA210944-01	9208826	2017	Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy	The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology\nand to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation\ntherapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4\nimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory\neffects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across\nmultiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and\nanimal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of\nprojects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on\ntwo clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT\n(HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and\ndurvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast\ncarcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the\nmechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining\ndendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of\nresistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in\nProjects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this\nP01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a\nstate-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to\ndrive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact\nis to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune\ntherapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.

project	5P01CA210944-03	5P01CA210944-03	9773984	2019	Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy	The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology\nand to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation\ntherapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4\nimmune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory\neffects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across\nmultiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and\nanimal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of\nprojects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on\ntwo clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT\n(HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and\ndurvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast\ncarcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the\nmechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining\ndendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of\nresistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in\nProjects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this\nP01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a\nstate-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to\ndrive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact\nis to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune\ntherapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.

The CAR developed at our center is now in international trials for refractory/relapsed pre-B cell acute\nlymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic\nlymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remain as the major unmet medical need in blood cancers. Our central hypothesis\nis that therapies with combination of CAR T cells and universal CAR T cells created with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic\nediting will enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer. We have\nbrought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and\npublished together for many years. Each disease-focused project will be led by a recognized authority in the\nfield. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which will coordinately closely with essential\nshared resource cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients\non two clinical trials: (i) CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD22 will be used to address the remaining unmet\nmedical need in ALL, which is the emergence of CD19 escape variants; and (ii) universal CAR T cells targeting\nCD19 will be tested in patients with CLL to determine the role of T cell intrinsic resistance to therapy. In AML,\nthe central problem in CAR T cell therapy is the lack of a known surface antigen that is present on AML but\nlacking from normal hematopoiesis. The goal of Project 2 is to open a wide therapeutic window by genetically\nmodifying normal marrow to make it resistant to killing by anti-AML CAR T cells, and delivering potent anti-\nleukemic CAR T cells specific for CD33. In Project 3, the overall hypothesis is that anti-myeloma efficacy will be\nmaximized by (i) combining CART-BCMA and CTL019 to eliminate both the dominant neoplastic PC population\nand rare myeloma-propagating B cells, and (ii) modifying CAR T cells to circumvent specific myeloma-induced\nT-cell-inhibitory mechanisms (i.e., immune checkpoints).\nThe Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of project management for collaboration\nand biostatistics, clinical safety and monitoring, and fiscal support (Core A), a GMP facility for manufacture of\ncells and RNA (Core B), and a state-of-the-art platform for GLP analysis to provide high dimensional data of the\nsamples generated in all Projects (Core C).

The CAR developed at our center is now in international trials for refractory/relapsed pre-B cell acute\nlymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic\nlymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remain as the major unmet medical need in blood cancers. Our central hypothesis\nis that therapies with combination of CAR T cells and universal CAR T cells created with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic\nediting will enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with blood cancer. We have\nbrought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines who have collaborated and\npublished together for many years. Each disease-focused project will be led by a recognized authority in the\nfield. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which will coordinately closely with essential\nshared resource cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients\non two clinical trials: (i) CAR T cells targeting CD19 and CD22 will be used to address the remaining unmet\nmedical need in ALL, which is the emergence of CD19 escape variants; and (ii) universal CAR T cells targeting\nCD19 will be tested in patients with CLL to determine the role of T cell intrinsic resistance to therapy. In AML,\nthe central problem in CAR T cell therapy is the lack of a known surface antigen that is present on AML but\nlacking from normal hematopoiesis. The goal of Project 2 is to open a wide therapeutic window by genetically\nmodifying normal marrow to make it resistant to killing by anti-AML CAR T cells, and delivering potent anti-\nleukemic CAR T cells specific for CD33. In Project 3, the overall hypothesis is that anti-myeloma efficacy will be\nmaximized by (i) combining CART-BCMA and CTL019 to eliminate both the dominant neoplastic PC population\nand rare myeloma-propagating B cells, and (ii) modifying CAR T cells to circumvent specific myeloma-induced\nT-cell-inhibitory mechanisms (i.e., immune checkpoints).\nThe Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of project management for collaboration\nand biostatistics, clinical safety and monitoring, and fiscal support (Core A), a GMP facility for manufacture of\ncells and RNA (Core B), and a state-of-the-art platform for GLP analysis to provide high dimensional data of the\nsamples generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the lessons\nof CAR T for ALL into meaningful efficacy against all hematologic malignancies.

Encompassed\nwithin this broad overall goal are the following more specific goals: 1) develop novel therapeutic strategies for\nadvanced/recurrent endometrial cancer and aggressive subtypes; 2) promote novel strategies for unmet\nclinical needs in prevention and conservative therapy of high-risk precancerous lesions and low grade\nendometrial cancer; 3) incorporate molecular diagnostics into clinical decision-making; and 4) recruit and\nsupport new investigators in endometrial cancer research through the Career Enhancement and\nDevelopmental Research Programs. Over the last 5 years, our SPORE has led the field with a highly\nproductive translational research team that has helped to define the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of\nendometrial cancer. This proposal includes 4 translational research projects addressing scientific problems\nthat span the breadth of endometrial cancer heterogeneity in an effort to impact as many patients as possible.\nProject 1, “Novel Targeted Strategies for Prevention and Conservative Management of Complex Atypical\nHyperplasia and Grade 1 Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer,” includes a phase II trial using the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus to improve standard conservative therapy (progestin-eluting intrauterine device) and is paired with\ninnovative molecular profiling and pharmacologic approaches to further advance conservative treatment\noptions. Project 2, “CTNNB1 Mutation and Wnt Pathway Activation Define Clinically Aggressive Endometrioid\nEndometrial Carcinoma,” focuses on targeted therapeutics and molecular mechanisms underlying a clinically\naggressive subtype of endometrioid endometrial cancer that is driven through beta-catenin mutation and\ndownstream Wnt pathway activation. Project 3, “EphA2 Targeting in Uterine Carcinoma,” focuses on the\ntherapeutic target, EphA2. EphA2 is overexpressed especially in higher grade endometrioid carcinomas and in\nserous carcinoma and is associated with poor overall survival. A phase I clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy\nand toxicity of a novel therapeutic (EPHARNA) that targets EphA2 by delivering short interfering RNA into\ntumor cells via a neutral liposome nanovehicle. This therapeutic was developed by Project 3 investigators.\nProject 4, “A Framework for Identification of Novel Targeted Therapy Combinations in Endometrial Cancer,”\nwill evaluate tumor molecular changes from samples procured during a combinatorial trial of PARP and PI3K\npathway targeted therapy to identify biomarkers of benefit for patients with endometrial cancer. This is paired\nwith implementing a platform to evaluate mechanisms responsible for adaptive resistance to targeted therapies\nin order to enable a rational design of improved combination therapies. Four Cores will support these projects-\nAdministrative Core, Pathology Core, Biomarkers Core, and Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core.

This parent proposal includes 4 translational research projects addressing\nscientific problems that span the breadth of endometrial cancer heterogeneity in an effort to impact as many\npatients as possible. Project 1, “Novel Targeted Strategies for Prevention and Conservative Management of\nComplex Atypical Hyperplasia and Grade 1 Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer,” includes a phase II trial using\nthe mTOR inhibitor everolimus to improve standard conservative therapy (progestin-eluting intrauterine device)\nand is paired with innovative molecular profiling and pharmacologic approaches to further advance conservative\ntreatment options. Project 2, “CTNNB1 Mutation and Wnt Pathway Activation Define Clinically Aggressive\nEndometrioid Endometrial Carcinoma,” focuses on targeted therapeutics and molecular mechanisms underlying\na clinically aggressive subtype of endometrioid endometrial cancer. It is hypothesized that CTNNB1 mutation\nand Wnt pathway activation promote immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, which enables tumor\nprogression and recurrence. Project 3, “EphA2 Targeting in Uterine Carcinoma,” focuses on the therapeutic\ntarget, EphA2, which is overexpressed in higher grade endometrioid carcinomas and serous carcinoma and is\nassociated with poor overall survival. A phase I clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a novel\ntherapeutic (EPHARNA; developed by Project 3 investigators) that targets EphA2 by delivering short interfering\nRNA into tumor cells via a neutral liposome nanovehicle. Project 4, “Rational Combinatorial Therapy in\nEndometrial Cancer,” will evaluate tumor molecular changes from biopsies procured during a combinatorial trial\nof PARP and PI3K pathway targeted therapy to identify biomarkers of benefit for patients with endometrial\ncancer. This is paired with implementing a testing platform to evaluate mechanisms responsible for adaptive\nresistance to targeted therapies in order to enable design of improved combination therapies for endometrial\ncancer. The proposed expansion project will elaborate upon the themes of Project 2 and examine the impact\nof PTEN loss and loss of CD73-generated adenosine signaling in the development of an immunosuppressive\ntumor microenvironment. Completion of this expansion project and Project 2 will help us to identify more\nprecisely molecular modifiers of the local tumor microenvironment and will aid in the development of more\nrational immune-based therapy strategies.

Encompassed\nwithin this broad overall goal are the following more specific goals: 1) develop novel therapeutic strategies for\nadvanced/recurrent endometrial cancer and aggressive subtypes; 2) promote novel strategies for unmet\nclinical needs in prevention and conservative therapy of high-risk precancerous lesions and low grade\nendometrial cancer; 3) incorporate molecular diagnostics into clinical decision-making; and 4) recruit and\nsupport new investigators in endometrial cancer research through the Career Enhancement and\nDevelopmental Research Programs. Over the last 5 years, our SPORE has led the field with a highly\nproductive translational research team that has helped to define the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of\nendometrial cancer. This proposal includes 4 translational research projects addressing scientific problems\nthat span the breadth of endometrial cancer heterogeneity in an effort to impact as many patients as possible.\nProject 1, “Novel Targeted Strategies for Prevention and Conservative Management of Complex Atypical\nHyperplasia and Grade 1 Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer,” includes a phase II trial using the mTOR inhibitor\neverolimus to improve standard conservative therapy (progestin-eluting intrauterine device) and is paired with\ninnovative molecular profiling and pharmacologic approaches to further advance conservative treatment\noptions. Project 2, “CTNNB1 Mutation and Wnt Pathway Activation Define Clinically Aggressive Endometrioid\nEndometrial Carcinoma,” focuses on targeted therapeutics and molecular mechanisms underlying a clinically\naggressive subtype of endometrioid endometrial cancer that is driven through beta-catenin mutation and\ndownstream Wnt pathway activation. Project 3, “EphA2 Targeting in Uterine Carcinoma,” focuses on the\ntherapeutic target, EphA2. EphA2 is overexpressed especially in higher grade endometrioid carcinomas and in\nserous carcinoma and is associated with poor overall survival. A phase I clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy\nand toxicity of a novel therapeutic (EPHARNA) that targets EphA2 by delivering short interfering RNA into\ntumor cells via a neutral liposome nanovehicle. This therapeutic was developed by Project 3 investigators.\nProject 4, “A Framework for Identification of Novel Targeted Therapy Combinations in Endometrial Cancer,”\nwill evaluate tumor molecular changes from samples procured during a combinatorial trial of PARP and PI3K\npathway targeted therapy to identify biomarkers of benefit for patients with endometrial cancer. This is paired\nwith implementing a platform to evaluate mechanisms responsible for adaptive resistance to targeted therapies\nin order to enable a rational design of improved combination therapies. Four Cores will support these projects-\nAdministrative Core, Pathology Core, Biomarkers Core, and Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core.

This disease has resulted in world-wide fatalities, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease, and arterial hypertension. As of June 2020, close to 6.6 million cases and death of 393,000 were reported worldwide; 1.95 million cases and more than 111,000 deaths in the US. COVID-19 poses a specific and substantial immediate burden on cancer patients who are already facing the tribulations of cancer treatment and survivorship. SARS-CoV-2 will continue to be a major threat to the lives of the above high risk groups including current and future cancer patients irrespective of the type and stage of cancer, unless a treatment that does not interfere with current cancer chemotherapies is developed urgently. CoVs are enveloped with a positive sense, single-strand RNA genome; and belong to the Coronaviridae family. CoVs are composed of at least 5 major fundamental proteins: replicase encoding polypeptide (pp1ab), Spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The viral life cycle begins with the infection, entry of the virion into cells by the binding to the host cell receptor and endocytosis (S protein), release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm and its transport to the host nucleus (N protein) where it replicates (pp1ab) and new virus particles are released. This results in respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. pp1ab, E and N proteins, unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not natively expressed in mammalian cells, offer potential opportunities for therapeutic targeting to cure COVID-19. Current drug and treatment strategies include blocking of RNA-polymerase, mRNA-based vaccines to induce antibody production, antibody treatments, and isolation of plasma and antibodies from the survivors of Covid-19. Since there are several unwarranted side effects of targeting the proteins essential to SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread, limited benefits of the current drugs, and limited availability of COVID-19 disease animal models, our strategy is to use and prioritize siRNA candidates based on the greatest inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (in model cell lines transfected with individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins) for further evaluation. We aim to use the siRNA-based therapeutic candidates with either an aerosolized (through a collision nebulizer) neutral phospholipid 1,2- dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine nanoliposomes (DOPC) or plant-derived vesicles (PDV) to specifically target the vital proteins of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit its replication and virus assembly. We expect this approach will have a potent anti-viral RNAi response leading to viral clearance.	2019-nCoV;Aerosols;Animal Disease Models;Antibodies;Antibody Formation;Antibody Therapy;Antiviral Agents;Binding;COVID-19;COVID-19 pandemic;Cancer Patient;Cancer Survivorship;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cell Line;Cell Nucleus;Cell model;Cells;Cessation of life;Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure;China;Coronavirus;Cytoplasm;DNA;DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase;Disease;Endocytosis;Enteral;Evaluation;Family;Future;Genome;Hypertension;Individual;Infection;Lecithin;Life Cycle Stages;Liver diseases;Lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Membrane Proteins;Messenger RNA;Nebulizer;Nucleocapsid Proteins;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Phospholipids;Plants;Plasma;Proteins;RNA;RNA Interference;Receptor Cell;Reporting;Small Interfering RNA;Survivors;Vaccines;Vesicle;Viral;Viral Genome;Virion;Virus Assembly;Virus Diseases;aerosolized;base;cancer therapy;env Gene Products;experience;high risk population;nanoformulation;nanoliposome;nervous system disorder;pandemic disease;polypeptide;replicase;respiratory;response;side effect;therapeutic candidate;therapeutic siRNA;therapeutic target;treatment strategy	UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR	HOUSTON	TX	UNITED STATES	RUSSELL R BROADDUS,Karen Hsieh Lu	JoyAnn  Courtney	162000	162000	2020-09-09T04:00:00Z	2003-09-01T04:00:00Z	2022-08-31T04:00:00Z	PA-18-591
project	5P50CA174521-03	5P50CA174521-03	9342676	2017	Neuroendocrine Tumor Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Human Cancer	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare tumors present several challenges, including lack of evidence based treatment recommendations, unwillingness of insurance companies to support unproven therapies, and keen competition for translational research support that may benefit only a small proportion of all cancer patients. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) targeted in this proposal are rare tumors that face all of these challenges. NETs arise from the diffuse neuroendocrine system, occur in both adults and children, and are increasing in both incidence and prevalence in the United States. The University of Iowa is one of only a handful of academic or private institutions in the US where patients with NETs are diagnosed, treated, and regularly followed in a comprehensive manner. A multi-disciplinary NET clinic, an IRB approved registry and database, and a growing translational research program are housed at the University of Iowa. We have collaborated with pharmaceutical and biotech companies, patient support groups, and other research institutions whose expertise complements our clinical and translational expertise, to build a neuroendocrine tumor Center of Excellence. Iowa is poised to house the first SPORE in neuroendocrine tumors where academic, industry, and philanthropic organizations will partner with NCI to increase the length and quality of life for these unique patients. Our Overall Specific Aims are: 1. Support innovative translational research in Neuroendocrine Tumors. 2. Provide support to translational investigators through interactive cores. 3. Enlist and encourage new translational researchers in neuroendocrine tumors through developmental projects and career development. 4. Promote early and accurate diagnosis through outreach to physicians and advocacy groups.	90Y;Adult;Advocacy;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;Biometry;Biotechnology;Bone Marrow;Cancer Patient;Child;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collaborations;Communication;Complement;Data Analyses;Data Quality;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Imaging;Diagnostic Procedure;Diffuse;Disease;Dose;Early Diagnosis;Effectiveness;Evidence based treatment;Face;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genomic approach;Human;Image;Incidence;Industry;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Insurance;Investments;Iowa;Islet Cell Tumor;Kidney;Length;Malignant Neoplasms;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mutate;Neuroendocrine Therapy;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Neurosecretory Systems;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Physicians;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prevalence;Privatization;Prognostic Marker;Quality Control;Quality of life;Radiation;Radioisotopes;Radiopharmaceuticals;Recommendation;Registries;Research;Research Support;Resistance;Small Intestines;Source;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Structure;Support Groups;Toxic effect;Tracer;Translating;Translational Research;Tumor Bank;Tumor Tissue;United States;Universities;accurate diagnosis;career development;chemotherapeutic agent;exome;imaging agent;improved;innovation;metaiodobenzylguanidine;molecular marker;multidisciplinary;new therapeutic target;novel diagnostics;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;outreach;patient population;public health relevance;theranostics;therapeutic target;translational research program;translational scientist;tumor	UNIVERSITY OF IOWA	IOWA CITY	IA	UNITED STATES	M.

project	5P50CA186786-04	5P50CA186786-04	9329981	2017	SPORE in Prostate Cancer	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since inception in 1995, the University of Michigan (UIVI) Prostate SPORE has endeavored to tap the vast intellectual and physical resources of the UM community to decrease the morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer (PCa). The UIVI Prostate SPORE supports an interactive group of basic and clinical investigators in a translational research program that has led to major discoveries in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. Successful translation of discoveries in the most recent grant period include: 1) development of a urine test for prostate cancer which is now offered in CLIA reference laboratories (Sci TransI Med. 2011); 2) ETS gene fusion driven PCa that are susceptible to PARP inhibitor therapy (Cancer Cell 2011) which initiated a randomized Phase II trial (NCTOI576172); 3) germline mutations in HOXB 13 gene that conferred increased risk for PCa (N Engl J Med. 2012). This is being developed as a test for assessing PCa risk; 4) the first study describing the mutational landscape of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (Nature 2012,) and; 5) Cabozantinib was shown to have efficacy and decrease bone pain in prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis (J Clin Oncol. 2013). These bench-to-bedside applications were aided by horizontal collaborations with the Dana Farber, Baylor, Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins Prostate SPOREs as well as the EDRN and vertical collaborations with SWOG and biotech companies. This application consists of four multidisciplinary projects: Project 1: A Precision Medicine Approach to Elucidate Mechanisms of Progression and Resistance to Therapy in Advanced PCa; Project 2: Mechanisms of Sensitivity and Resistance to Cabozantinib in CRPC; Project 3: Development of Novel BET Bromodomain Inhibitors for the Treatment of Advanced PCa; Project 4: Development of IncRNAs as PCa Biomarkers in Urine. These projects are complemented by ongoing, successful Career Development and Developmental Research Programs. The projects and programs are supported by a strong ongoing institutional commitment of money and space as well as three cores: Administration, Biostatistics, and Tissue/Informatics. The UM Prostate SPORE program continues to place premiums on rigorous scientific review of its translational research programs, pairing of basic and clinical investigators, drawing on expertise of scientists from within and fro outside the prostate cancer field, and utilizing flexibility to fund promising new research approaches. The interaction of our multidisciplinary group of investigators clearly makes the Prostate SPORE program at the UMCCC is greater than the sum of its individual parts.

In this renewal application, U-M joins forces with Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) to propose a\n“Michigan Prostate SPORE” leveraging our institutions' respective areas of strength. KCI has a non-overlapping\npatient population as U-M, which includes an underserved population. The Michigan Prostate SPORE supports\nan interactive group of basic and clinical investigators in a translational research program that has led to major\ndiscoveries in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of PCa. Successful translation of discoveries in the\nmost recent grant period include: 1) The ETS gene fusions (which were discovered by this SPORE program)\nhave been established as a urine test for the early detection of PCa (JAMA Oncology 2017 3:1085) and have\nbeen therapeutically targeted with peptidomimetic inhibitors (Cancer Cell 2017 31:844). 2) Our SPORE program\nplayed a significant role in defining the clinically actionable landscape of metastatic castration-resistant prostate\ncancer (mCRPC) (Cell 2015, 162:454) which led to the discovery that upwards of 20-25% of mCRPC harbor\ndefects in DNA repair genes. As part of the TO-PARP study, we showed that mCRPC patients with DNA repair\ndefects preferentially respond to PARP inhibitors (NEJM 2015, 373:1697). 3) Established that BET bromodomain\ninhibitors may be useful in the treatment of advanced PCa by blocking oncogenic transcription factor activity\n(Nature 2014, 510:278). 4) Several PCa-associated long non-coding RNAs, including PCAT1, Schlap1 (Nature\nGenetics 2013 45:1392), and ARlnc1 (Nature Genetics 2018, 50:814) were discovered and characterized.

This application consists of four projects: Project 1:\nTargeting mCRPC Patients with Biallelic Loss of CDK12; Project 2: Integrating a Novel MiPS-Based Next-\nGeneration Sequencing Urine Assay for the Early Detection of Unfavorable Risk PCa; Project 3: Exploring\nAblation of the Androgen Receptor as a Therapeutic Approach for mCRPC; Project 4: Targeting Autophagy in\nthe Treatment of mCRPC. These projects are complemented by strong, ongoing institutional commitments of\nmoney and space, successful Career Development and Developmental Research Programs, and three\ncores: Administration, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics, and Biospecimen/Pathology. The Michigan Prostate\nSPORE continues to place premiums on rigorous scientific review of its translational research programs, pairing\nof basic and clinical investigators, drawing on expertise of scientists from within and from outside the PCa field,\nand utilizing flexibility to fund promising new research approaches. The interaction of our multidisciplinary group\nof investigators clearly makes the Michigan Prostate SPORE greater than the sum of its individual parts.

This work is urgently needed\nbecause cancer screening and prevention disparities exist with regard to delivery of evidence-based\ninterventions (EBIs). Effective strategies to improve implementation of EBIs in primary care community health\ncenters (CHCs) that can eliminate these disparities are not known or poorly understood. Implementation\nscience can contribute new knowledge that will transform CHCs' ability to serve the nation's most vulnerable\npopulations. The BRIDGE-C2 Center will: 1) create a sustainable infrastructure for developing, conducting, and\ncontinuously evaluating implementation strategies that enhance primary care's ability to equitably deliver\nevidence-based cancer screening and prevention interventions to all people, emphasizing closing care gaps\nfor vulnerable populations; 2) build capacity and training opportunities, and engage a multi-disciplinary team of\nimplementation science and methods experts, to facilitate the development of innovative approaches relevant\nto our grand challenge; and 3) identify strategies to improve implementation of cancer screening and\nprevention EBIs in primary care, and conduct research / develop pragmatic methods to tailor, enhance, and\nsupport the adoption and sustainability of these strategies.

CHCs adapted and changed the way they deliver care during the current pandemic. For example, our Laboratory CHCs showed an 80% decline of in-person office visits, March to April 2020, in which cancer preventive care is typically delivered. This supplement will allow our team to collect the data needed to inform and align the research of our BRIDGE-C2 Center Parent Grant with the new realities of providing healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will track and understand the implementation strategies made by CHCs to change healthcare delivery processes and priorities, especially cancer preventive care, and share these critical lessons with a variety of stakeholders including the Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control Program (ISC3 ) and CHCs across the US. With this supplement we will extend the work of our Parent Grant to answer the following questions: (1) What impact has COVID-19 had on the delivery of cancer preventive care; (2) What are the within and across state variations in CHC response to local levels of the COVID-19 outbreak and state / county actions; (3) What processes did CHCs use to adapt existing or adopt new strategies and implement operational changes to realign care with cancer preventive care guidelines in the COVID-19 context; and, (4) How do these findings inform BRIDGE-C2 Center’s future work? Once answered, more questions will become apparent leading to larger scale investigations and additional requests for grant funding. The BRIDGE-C2 Center with its national Implementation Laboratory of geographically diverse CHCs caring for over 1.9 million patients impacted by health disparities is uniquely positioned to extend its Parent Grant to quickly answer these important questions. The Aims of this supplement are: Aim 1: Identify and monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on delivery and receipt of cancer preventive care over a 12-month period; Aim 2: Identify the processes CHCs used, the external support and assistance they received to implement and adapt cancer preventive care to the COVID19 pandemic context, and operational changes employed to realign care with cancer prevention guidelines; and, Aim 3: Rapidly disseminate findings to a variety of relevant stakeholders. This supplemental work will: (1) advance implementation science by understanding how local adaptations were rapidly implemented or deimplemented in a crisis; (2) guide cancer prevention recommendations on identifying new or adapted ways to deliver cancer preventive care; and (3) rapidly distill and widely disseminate critical implementation findings to NCI laboratories and centers, CHCs and other primary care settings.

The Centers will select a set of outer context\ncommon data elements (OC-CDE) and build a repository with these data. Measures of interest to include in the\nOC-CDE repository represent seven domains to capture the following environments: food, physical, economic,\nsocial, health care, cancer behavioral and screening, and cancer-related polices. As we plan and implement\ninterventions for the prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer, we must take the outer context into\naccount. Indeed, SDH are key influencers of health inequality and contribute to health disparities between\npopulations and communities. The BRIDGE-C2 Center Implementation Laboratory is a network of community\nhealth centers (CHCs). CHCs face some of the most difficult implementation challenges, as they primarily\nserve patients with low-income, without health insurance, and living in rural areas. As the BRIDGE-C2 Center\ntargets implementation strategies aimed at improving the adoption of evidence-based cancer screening and\nprevention interventions, it is clear that we cannot ignore the outer context that the CHCs deliver care in as well\nas the contextual conditions that patients' experience. As such, collecting outer context measures is essential\nto provide a robust and complete environmental scan of the clinics. In addition, the BRIDGE-C2 Center is\nuniquely positioned to assess the independent or combined effect of SDH at the clinic- versus the patient-level.\nTherefore, the BRIDGE-C2 Center has two main aims for this supplement, first to contribute to the collection of\nouter context measures and conduct an environmental scan of SDH within the BRIDGE-C2 Center\nImplementation Laboratory of CHCs in OR, WA, and CA; and second to assess the independent or combined\neffect of contextual SDH at the clinic- and patient-level on adoption of evidence-based cancer screening and\nprevention. This will be the first study to assess the impact of practice outer context on cancer screening and\nprevention interventions while accounting for the patient-level SDH. Findings from this study will provide\nvaluable learnings for all ISC3 Centers and inform cross-Center collaboration in Phase II of the supplement.

As an Advanced Center, the vision of the Washington University Implementation\nScience Center for Cancer Control (WU-ISCCC) is to conduct implementation research to help eliminate\ncancer disparities in rural and other disadvantaged communities.\nGoal. The overall goal of the WU-ISCCC is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for rapid-cycle\nimplementation research to increase the reach, external validity, and sustainability of effective cancer control\ninterventions. Our goal and Center activities capture three distinct features: (1) a focus on elimination of cancer\ndisparities; (2) the need for rapid-cycle studies; and (3) the use of systems science approaches to enhance\nmethods and outcomes in implementation science.\nSetting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration,\ncatalyzes new ideas, and ensures support for research that finds solutions for complex implementation\nchallenges in real-world settings with high cancer disparities (rural and urban counties in Missouri and Illinois).\nSubstantial matching contributions from Washington University will allow us to strategically invest in new ideas.\nAims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) advance the field of implementation science in cancer control\nby conducting innovative and impactful research; (2) expand an exceptional, diverse team of implementation\nscience investigators and stakeholders; (3) organize and integrate Center components to facilitate\ntransdisciplinary team science; (4) develop an Implementation Laboratory (known as the “Innovation\nIncubator”) to serve as a conduit for innovative, rapid-cycle, and impactful research; and (5) address cancer\ndisparities by making it as easy as possible for disadvantaged populations to encounter, use, and benefit from\nevidence-based interventions.\nInnovations and impact. The WU-ISCCC will be innovative and provide a significant return on the scientific\ninvestment. First, our Center has distinctive features that include a combined focus on cancer disparities, the\napplication of strategies to conduct rapid-cycle studies, and the use of systems science approaches. Second,\nwe have assembled a diverse, world class team with strong linkages to multiple practice settings that will be\ncritical parts of our Innovation Incubator. Third, we will engage investigators from different disciplines and\ninvest in the development of early career scholars as cancer implementation scientists. Fourth, we will\nstrategically and creatively disseminate products in ways that will benefit researchers, practitioners, and\ncommunity members. Fifth, we have developed a focused strategy for collective integration of our projects,\ncores, and units to ensure that the WU-ISCCC impact is greater than the sum of its individual parts.

As an Advanced Center, the vision of the Washington University Implementation\nScience Center for Cancer Control (WU-ISCCC) is to conduct implementation research to help eliminate\ncancer disparities in rural and other disadvantaged communities.\nGoal. The overall goal of the WU-ISCCC is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for rapid-cycle\nimplementation research to increase the reach, external validity, and sustainability of effective cancer control\ninterventions. Our goal and Center activities capture three distinct features: (1) a focus on elimination of cancer\ndisparities; (2) the need for rapid-cycle studies; and (3) the use of systems science approaches to enhance\nmethods and outcomes in implementation science.\nSetting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration,\ncatalyzes new ideas, and ensures support for research that finds solutions for complex implementation\nchallenges in real-world settings with high cancer disparities (rural and urban counties in Missouri and Illinois).\nSubstantial matching contributions from Washington University will allow us to strategically invest in new ideas.\nAims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) advance the field of implementation science in cancer control\nby conducting innovative and impactful research; (2) expand an exceptional, diverse team of implementation\nscience investigators and stakeholders; (3) organize and integrate Center components to facilitate\ntransdisciplinary team science; (4) develop an Implementation Laboratory (known as the “Innovation\nIncubator”) to serve as a conduit for innovative, rapid-cycle, and impactful research; and (5) address cancer\ndisparities by making it as easy as possible for disadvantaged populations to encounter, use, and benefit from\nevidence-based interventions.\nInnovations and impact. The WU-ISCCC will be innovative and provide a significant return on the scientific\ninvestment. First, our Center has distinctive features that include a combined focus on cancer disparities, the\napplication of strategies to conduct rapid-cycle studies, and the use of systems science approaches. Second,\nwe have assembled a diverse, world class team with strong linkages to multiple practice settings that will be\ncritical parts of our Innovation Incubator. Third, we will engage investigators from different disciplines and\ninvest in the development of early career scholars as cancer implementation scientists. Fourth, we will\nstrategically and creatively disseminate products in ways that will benefit researchers, practitioners, and\ncommunity members. Fifth, we have developed a focused strategy for collective integration of our projects,\ncores, and units to ensure that the WU-ISCCC impact is greater than the sum of its individual parts. In\nsummary, the WU-ISCCC will be a national resource for furthering implementation science for eliminating\ncancer disparities.

While the outer context has received\nless attention within implementation science than the inner context of implementing organizations, accounting\nfor it can improve work focused on advancing health equity.\nGoal: The goal of this competitive supplement is to conduct an environmental scan of the outer context of each\nof the ISC3 centers, compile outer contextual factors into a database, and use the information gathered to\ndevelop new, cross-center pilot projects. Additionally, we propose to develop and evaluate findings specific to\nthe Washington University in St. Louis Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control to our\nImplementation Laboratory in a manner that is relevant to our community stakeholders.\nMethods: Aim 1: Characterize the outer context of the ISC3 network and assess its relationship with cancer\nprevention and control indicators. We will work alongside the other centers in the ISC3 network to finalize\nmeasures representing key features of the outer context, in order to characterize the outer context related to\nequity in cancer prevention and control. We will contract with HealthLandscape to collect these data from\nexisting national data sources and compile them into a common database for use across the network. Also, we\nwill examine the relationship between outer context and cancer prevalence, cancer-related behaviors, and\npolicies across the ISC3 network. Aim 2: Disseminate information about the outer context of the WU-ISC3 to\nour community partners. We will develop community snapshots to summarize the findings about the outer\ncontext specific to the WU-ISC3 community (i.e., 82-county catchment area served by the Siteman Cancer\nCenter). We will evaluate our stakeholders’ (e.g., representatives from community organizations, clinicians,\ncommunity members) opinions about the usefulness of these snapshots through a survey and in-depth\ninterviews. Feedback from our stakeholders will be used to refine dissemination materials and ensure their\nrelevance to our Center’s stakeholders.\nInnovations and impact: The proposed work will result in the compilation of the first set of common data\nelements collected across all ISC3 centers and will facilitate future cross-center collaborations to improve the\nimplementation of evidence-based programs and policies for cancer prevention and control and health equity.

Optimized\nimplementation occurs when: (1) the strategies employed to implement EBIs address the key barriers to\nimplementation that are active in the specific settings in which implementation occurs, and (2) those strategies\nreflect the best possible methods for addressing the barriers. Despite two decades of progress in implementation\nscience (IS), practical tools and guidance to support optimized EBI implementation are lacking; as a result,\nstrategies are often mismatched to barriers and are often not optimized for effectiveness, efficiency, or fit with local\nresources. The result is suboptimal implementation in the form of lost time, effort, and resources and, ultimately,\npoorer cancer outcomes. The OPTICC Center will advance IS and, in turn, improve EBI implementation in cancer\ncontrol by developing, testing, and refining innovative methods for optimizing EBI implementation. The OPTICC\nCenter is a strategic collaboration of the University of Washington (UW), Kaiser Permanente Washington Health\nResearch Institute (KPWHRI), and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three cores will\nsupport its work. The Administrative Core will promote multidisciplinary collaboration, research excellence, and\nmethodological innovation. It will also lead Center outreach and dissemination efforts, evaluate Center impact, and\ncoordinate Center activities. The Research Program Core will conduct innovative implementation studies, method\nand measurement studies, and small pilot studies that advance the Center’s “grand challenge” IS theme of\noptimizing EBI implementation. A three-stage approach to optimizing EBI implementation will be taken—identify\nand prioritize barriers, match strategies, and test strategies—with measurement development spanning all three\nstages. The Implementation Laboratory Core will establish and coordinate a network of diverse clinical and\ncommunity sites to conduct “in vivo” IS studies, implement cancer control EBIs, and shape the Center’s research\nagenda. The Center’s initial studies will focus on optimizing implementation of screening EBIs for cervical,\ncolorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer. However, the methods for optimizing EBI implementation that the Center\nwill develop, test, and refine can be applied broadly across the cancer care continuum, for a wide range of cancers,\nto answer a wide range of IS questions.

Implementation science (IS) has particular potential to accelerate\nprogress toward achieving health equity goals, and significant work has focused on implementation in settings\nthat serve marginalized populations. Context is a central feature of IS, yet it is frequently poorly defined or goes\nunreported. When it is considered, attention to context is mostly focused on the inner setting in which the\nintervention is implemented, with relatively little consideration of how the outer context may impact\nimplementation. Failure to fully measure outer context and to use those data to inform implementation efforts\nlimits the applicability and generalizability of study findings to different populations, settings, and time periods.\nThis supplement application under the OPTICC (Optimizing Implementation in Cancer Control) Center will\nmeet this challenge by partnering with the six other ISC3 centers to create a set of outer context common data\nelements (OC-CDE) that will be collected for all centers. Our proposed Aim is to characterize the outer context\nof OPTICC's I-Lab and contribute to the OC-CDE database. We will conduct an environmental scan of outer\ncontext factors that may impact OPTICC I-Lab implementation outcomes and create an OC-CDE database in\ncollaboration with ISC3 centers. For this process, we will meaningfully engage our I-Lab partners to not simply\ndefine state and county-level catchment areas for OC-CDE collection but also to explore how they might utilize\nthese data and their impressions of its impact on EBI implementation. This input will inform OPTICC's center-\nwide use of causal pathway diagrams articulating the role of factors influencing how strategies work. We will\nutilize the HealthLandscapes database to collect select measures across the domains of interest,\nsupplementing it with other publicly available data as needed. The final dataset will be uploaded into a shared\nREDCap database for analysis, manuscript development, and pilot planning. The final quarter of the project will\nbe spent on data cleaning, development of the cross-center data repository, and publications, presentations,\nand pilot project planning. The primary deliverable for this phase I effort is the development of a database with\nouter context measures for each center's catchment area and the initial description of the outer context across\nparticipating centers. We also expect this work to yield a rich data asset, with engaged I-Lab partners, and a\ncausal pathway positioning us to engage in cross-center pilot studies to advance health equity. This work will\nprepare centers for future opportunities to investigate the relationship of contextual factors to implementation\nstrategy selection, successful implementation, and sustainment.

The impact of these strategies on cancer outcomes is\nsignificant for both the general population and low income and under-represented groups that bear a\ndisproportionate share of preventable cancer burden, but evidence-based interventions have not been\nuniformly used across population groups. Gaps in implementation of the evidence base can be seen for nearly\nall known cancer prevention and early detection strategies. As a result, we incur substantial avoidable cancer\nmorbidity and mortality and tolerate preventable inequities.\nThe Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity (ISCCCE) will create an ecosystem for robust\nimplementation science (IS) related to cancer prevention and control in Massachusetts community health\ncenters (CHCs) and their local communities. Our theme, improving community health by integrating health\nequity and implementation science for evidence-based cancer control, reflects our critical mass of expertise in\ncancer disparities, IS, and community-based cancer prevention and control research. Our “grand challenge”\nis to address the inequitable implementation and limited scale of evidence-based interventions by developing\nand testing implementation strategies aimed at narrowing health inequities and by advancing methods that\ncarefully consider the low-resource, complex nature of CHCs where adaptation and cost-effective solutions are\nneeded most. The implementation studies we conduct will address inequities within CHC clinical practice as\nwell as prevention interventions that link to community resources and assets.

In Boston, a key hot spot, large hospitals\nare on the front-lines of pandemic response, offering emergent care for which they will be reimbursed. These\nhospital systems also have other resources (e.g. donors, real estate holdings) to mitigate the COVID-related\nfinancial impact. In contrast, Massachusetts’ (MA) community health centers (CHCs), which care for 50% of\nBoston residents and 20% of all MA residents, have primarily one source of revenue—reimbursement for\nprimary care. MA CHCs, which serve as the Implementation Laboratory (I-Lab) for our P50 Implementation\nScience Center for Cancer Control Equity (ISCCCE), have been financially devastated by the pandemic. Our\nstate-wide stay-at-home order (implemented 3/24/20 and ongoing) has brought primary care delivery nearly to\na halt. Net patient service revenue in CHCs is down by 50-70%, with lost revenue estimates of close to $150M\nin the first 12 weeks of the pandemic; over 3,000 CHC staff have been laid off. In the post-pandemic era,\nCHCs will be struggling to operate with fewer staff and to provide care to patients who themselves have faced\njob loss and other hardships. Challenges in ramping services back up will further limit CHCs’ financial recovery\nand the health of the communities they serve. At the same time, there will be a significant back-log of cancer\nscreening needs -- service delivery that will be key to increasing revenue flow and reducing disparities. It will\nbe particularly critical for CHCs to have efficient strategies that, even with reduced staffing, can help them\nefficiently meet their patients’ cancer screening needs.\nEarly detection through timely mammography and colorectal cancer screening is critical for reducing mortality,\nbut there are important disparities in access and stage at diagnosis and mortality [1, 2].\n For example, racial/\nethnic minorities are half as likely as Whites to receive timely follow-up after abnormal mammograms [2-6]. In\na post-COVID era, the factors that drive disparities in cancer screening outcomes will likely be exacerbated\nand lead to further racial, ethnic, and economic disparities without strategies that explicitly address these\ninequities [7]. Population health management systems may help close care gaps [8, 9], as they integrate\npatient data from diverse sources to quickly show where follow-up is needed [7, 10, 11]. Such systems may be\nparticularly critical to helping CHCs to rapidly identify and triage screening needs and follow-up, allowing\nefficient management of care needs despite their staffing and financial stressors. The key issue motivating this\nsupplement is the critical need to help CHCs in the post-COVID era to efficiently provide quality care in ways\nthat will meet patient needs and mitigate further disparities, while at the same time generating revenue. This\nsupplement will provide critical support needed by CHCs to continue to participate as an active partner in\nISCCCE, and will contribute to their overall survival. We will to develop and evaluate new electronic tools and\nimplementation supports to increase CHCs’ ability to efficiently provide fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) and\nmammography screening with timely follow-up, which will contribute to CHCs’ financial health and survival.\nThe Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity (ISCCCE) is an NCI P50 center. The\nISCCCE Implementation Lab includes 30 CHCs that use a common population health management\nplatform, the Data Reporting and Visualization System (DRVS), which integrates clinical, referral, and billing\ndata and includes functions for triggering screening referrals. However, the system does not include any\ntools for: 1) tracking screening that has been ordered but not completed; or 2) tracking follow-up of\nabnormal results—these activities are done manually. New tools could streamline the labor-intensive and\ntime-sensitive work of manual tracking and follow up that will be particularly crucial post-COVID, with limited\nstaffing, screening back-logs, and the urgent need to create efficiencies in care delivery.\nThe goal of this supplement is to develop and implement population management tools that will build critical\ninfrastructure to allow CHCs to efficiently provide cancer screening during pandemic recovery. We aim to\ndevelop and evaluate a resource-appropriate, technology-driven intervention to improve completion of FIT\nand mammography and timeliness of diagnostic resolution in the post-COVID era.

Implementation science (IS) has particular potential to accelerate\nprogress toward achieving health equity goals, and significant work has focused on implementation in settings\nthat serve marginalized populations. Context is a central feature of IS, yet it is frequently poorly defined or goes\nunreported. When it is considered, attention to context is mostly focused on the inner setting in which the\nintervention is implemented, with relatively little consideration of how the outer context may impact on\nimplementation. It is naïve to think that implementing organizations are not impacted by their community\ncontext. It is in the context in which employees are hired and work, that patients live in, and in which\norganizations must acquire goods and services to support their business and health care mission. Failure to\nfully measure outer context and to use that data to inform implementation efforts limits the applicability and\ngeneralizability of study findings to different populations, settings, and time periods.\nThis supplement application from the Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control Equity (ISCCCE) will\nmeet this challenge by partnering with the six other ISC3 centers to create a set of outer context common data\nelements (OC-CDE) that will be collected for all centers. This supplement represents a unique opportunity to\ncreate a robust set of shared measures that can be utilized to understand and explore the impact of outer\ncontext on implementation outcomes in a wide range of settings. This is a critical effort to conduct an\nenvironment scan that will characterize the outer implementation context in a comprehensive manner and that\nwill represent such a diverse range of settings across the US.

Penn offers a unique environment in which\nto conduct this paradigm-shifting work, given our expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics,\nand innovative cancer care delivery. The complementary and multi-disciplinary expertise of the three MPIs (Bei-\ndas, Bekelman, Schnoll), coupled with existing Penn resources, including the Penn Center for Cancer Care\nInnovation [PC3I], the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics [CHIBE], and the Penn Imple-\nmentation Science Center at the Leonard Davis Institute [PISCE@LDI], represent a unique opportunity to ad-\nvance the quality of cancer care. The Administrative Core, led by Drs. Beidas, Bekelman, and Schnoll, will ensure\nthat the activities of Penn ISC3 are coordinated, synergistic, and congruent with timelines. The Implementation\nLaboratory, led by Drs. Bekelman and Shulman, represents a diverse ecosystem that includes five hospitals and\nlinked clinical sites, with over 200 oncologists that serve over 15,000 unique new patients annually. Our Research\nProgram, led by Drs.

The Research Program includes investigators with ex-\npertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery research, healthcare innovation,\nmeasurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we propose three Signature Pilot Projects and two\nMethods Projects with a commitment to rapid learning that will allow Penn ISC3 to be optimally nimble.

The Research\nProgram will include an Implementation Studies Unit with an initial 2-year pilot study using adaptable\ntechnology to enhance shared decision-making in survivorship care planning for survivors of breast cancer.\nThe Research Program also includes a Methods Unit with an initial innovation pilot study to test the feasibility\nof natural language processing to measure communication patterns pre-implementation and to monitor\nimplementation fidelity of programs designed to enhance within-team and clinical team-to-patient electronic\ncommunication. The Research Program is expected to complete 8 to 10 pilot studies. In order to foster\nresearch aligned with iDAPT’s theme, we will build and sustain iDAPT’s Implementation Laboratory which\nincorporates capacity building and infrastructure for testing the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and\nreal time deployment of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The laboratory\nincludes primary care and oncology clinics in our local “Hubs” in southern Appalachia (North Carolina) and the\nnortheast (Massachusetts) and “Spokes” including over 900 community-based oncology clinics in the NCIs\nNational Community Oncology Research Program and nationwide Veteran’s Administration clinics. iDAPTs\nleadership is a multi-disciplinary team of experts with extensive experience in cancer-focused implementation\nscience, behavioral science, computer engineering and computer science, clinical informatics, formative\nqualitative methods, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The iDAPT Developing Center will be considered\nsuccessful if we achieve the following outcomes: (1) a robust, collaborative Implementation Laboratory with\npartners who are knowledgeable and experienced with implementation science in cancer control; (2)\ncompletion of 8 to 10 pilot projects related to iDAPTs emerging theme; (3) pilot grantees and lab partners are\nprepared to lead investigator initiated studies as a result of capacity building and pilot grant experiences; (4)\njunior faculty and underrepresented persons are engaged in all Center activities; (5) The field of\nimplementation science in cancer control is advanced aligned within iDAPT’s emerging theme; and (6) iDAPT\nis part of a new network of ISCCCs who collectively build the field of implementation science in cancer control.

The Implementation Science Centers in Cancer Control (ISC3) are uniquely\npositioned to evaluate the SDOH that drive these disparities and ultimately identify implementation strategies to\nreduce them. SDOH shape the Outer Context (i.e., broader sociopolitical environment) that affect communities,\nhealth systems, and its residents. The Inner Context (i.e., healthcare systems) is uniquely positioned to identify\nand address SDOH to improve patient care and cancer outcomes. The purpose of this Administrative\nSupplement is to advance health equity through implementation science using environmental scans and cross-\nsite collaboration. Specifically, we will (1) partner with all ISC3 centers to conduct an environmental scan of Outer\nContext common data elements to better understand the sociopolitical context that drives cancer-related\ndisparities; and (2) collaborate across two Centers (Wake Forest iDAPT ISC3 and UPenn ISC3) to measure Inner\nContext SDOHs within cancer care delivery settings. Results from this administrative supplement will facilitate\nmulti-site pilot implementation studies that improve the measurement and mitigation of SDOH to improve cancer\ncare outcomes and health equity.

Further advances in therapy will require a detailed understanding of the molecular underpinnings of T- ALL development and relapse. To this end, I have completed a highly innovative screen in zebrafish to identify genes associated with T-ALL progression and have found that the protein tyrosine phosphotase PRL-3 was commonly amplified in single T-ALL cells as they developed increased ability to form relapse over time. In transgenic animals, PRL-3 over-expression significantly enhanced primary T-ALL development and relapse formation. I have found that PRL-3 amplified in a subset of human T-ALL and is highly expressed by a majority of T-ALL patient samples. These cells are also sensitive to PRL-3 knock-down through the induction of apoptosis. These results imply that PRL-3 activity has an important role in T-ALL malignancy, and that PRL-3 and its substrates may represent novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of T-ALL. The objectives of this proposal are to 1) define the contribution of PRL-3 to T- ALL progression and relapse and 2) identify the mechanism by which PRL-3 drives T-ALL malignancy. This objective will be achieved through two specific aims. During the K99 phase of this award, I will complete Aim 1, where I will examine the effect of PRL-3 gain-of-function and loss-of-function in various stages of T-ALL development in zebrafish, including invasion from the thymus, intravasation, proliferation and relapse, and I will also test the effects of PRL-3 knock-down on human cells in a murine xenograft model. During this phase, I will learn techniques to directly image cancer progression in live animals and to develop orthotopic leukemia xenografts in mice. With this knowledge in hand, during the R00 phase I will complete Aim 2, where I will identify the target substrates of PRL-3 in T-ALL cells, and test the contribution of these genes and pathways to T-ALL malignancy using in vivo and in vitro epistasis experiments. In total, this work will lay the foundation for the development of small molecule PRL-3 and pathway inhibitors for potential therapeutic use in T-ALL. The mentored phase of this award will occur under the guidance of Dr. David Langenau, an expert in zebrafish models of cancer, and Dr. Thomas Look, an internationally recognized leader in the field of leukemia research. Their proven track record of mentorship, coupled with an intensive didactic component and the rigorous and nurturing academic environment offered by the research community of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School offer the best opportunity for my success as I transition to becoming an independent investigator.

ADAM10 was shown to be quite important in humoral immune function. Mice in which their B cells lack ADAM10 (ADAM10B-/-) had defective lymphoid architecture. We will examine whether multiple antigen injections can overcome the defects seen. Newly data indicates that B cell TNF production is responsible for the altered germinal center architecture seen in the ADAM10B-/- mice and that this is due to increased expression of the TNF sheddase ADAM17. The opposite effects for ADAM10 will also be examined, namely what happens when ADAM10 is overexpressed in B cells. Early overexpression in hematopoietic stem cells was shown to block B cell production in the current funding period. Incorporation of a floxxed stop site in fron of the ADAM10 will allow delay of the overexpression until B cells develop. In addition, the ADAM17B-/- mouse should also have elevated ADAM10 expression and enhanced Ig production. Of particular interest is IgE production and we hypothesize that elevated IgE production will correlate with elevated B cell ADAM10. With respect to ADAM10 targets important in B cell function, based on preliminary data, we will concentrate on two substrates, CD23 and fractalkine. Finally, we will examine whether B cell exosomes play a role in the immunostimulatory activity of IgE-antigen complexes. In the second aim, mice with elevated B cell ADAM10 will be examined for enhanced lung inflammation in mouse asthma models and the effect of ADAM10 inhibitors will be examined to determine if this mechanism is solely ADAM10 related. The effect of ADAM10 inhibitors on the lymphoid architecture of the bronchial associated lymphoid tissues will be determined. Using IgE reporter mice, we will specifically determine the effect of ADAM10 inhibitors and ADAM10B-/- mice for germinal center and IgE plasma cell levels. We anticipate that when ADAM10 levels are inhibited we can specifically inhibit the IgE response. Using a model we have developed for suppression of an ongoing asthma response, ADAM10 inhibitors will be examined for their capacity to block this response. Mice lacking ADAM10 in their epithelial cells will be studied to determine whether ADAM10 inhibitors are working primarily by their effect on immune cells. Preliminary evidence indicates that a subpopulation of active allergic patients have elevated B cell ADAM10 levels when compared to controls. We will examine if the B cells from these patients have enhanced IgE production, using in vitro B cell stimulation models. Overall, the project will continue studies ino new promising avenues for understanding and harnessing ADAM10 to control the immune response. In addition, these two aims test the hypothesis that the ratio of ADAM10 to ADAM17 is important especially with respect to the allergic phenotype.

Recent studies indicate that many tissue MØ are generated during embryonic development and maintain themselves in adults in the steady-state. In diseased tissues, however, many MØ originate from circulating monocytes (Mo). For example, we found that circulating Mo often inﬁltrate the ischemic myocardium, atherosclerotic plaques and growing tumors, where they differentiate into MØ and can promote disease. These circulating Mo can be released in large quantities from different reservoir locations, including th bone marrow and spleen, and various diseases enhance Mo production in these reservoirs by amplifying hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) locally. At present, an accurate understanding of disease-induced MØ responses is lacking and requires a more comprehensive analysis of the origins and dynamics of these cells at the organismal level. The research proposed in this application will deﬁne both the quantity and quality of tissue MØ based on thei origins. We propose that, in disease, distinct anatomical sites produce different types of MØ precursors and we will thus test the hypothesis that disease-associated tissue MØ responses can be tailored by manipulating these cells' topo-ontogenic sources. First, by taking the entire HSPC➝Mo➝MØ lineage into account we will identify the most important kinetic processes that deﬁne the quantity of disease-associated MØ (aim 1). Second, by considering the different origins of these MØ we will uncover maturational pathways that inﬂuence their quality in vivo (aim 2). Our ﬁndings have therapeutic potential because in both aims we will deﬁne how Ang II pathway manipulations control MØ. Ang II is a newly identiﬁed driver of HSPC/Mo/MØ-mediated inﬂammation that is active in a variety of diseases (cancer, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction) and can be targeted with FDA-approved drugs. Our goal is to develop new advances that can be used to restrain unwanted inﬂammatory reactions or instead promote delivery of protective immunity to tissue. Our experiments will use the so-called KP tumor mouse model because we have generated data indicating that: i) MØ in KP tumors have a dominant phenotype and promote disease; ii) many of these MØ originate from HSPC and Mo that are produced in bone marrow and spleen; iii) HSPC➝Mo➝MØ lineage ampliﬁcation in KP mice resembles the one observed in other disease models including myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis; and iv) the hormone Angiotensin (Ang) II ampliﬁes disease-promoting MØ in KP mice.

This DC population migrates to lymph nodes to induce adaptive immune responses and is notably proficient in cross-presentation of exogenous antigen to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Because of their tissue residence and function, CD103+ DCs are perfectly situated to regulate immune responses to tumors. However, little is understood about their role in cancer. CD103+ DCs are homologous to human tissue CD141+ DCs and DCs generated in GM-CSF for cancer therapy, and provide a genetically tractable system to understand these important DC populations. Recently, our lab and others found CD103+ DCs have a unique developmental pathway dependent on the cytokine GM-CSF, the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT5 and the transcriptional regulator Id2. This signaling pathway correlates with enhanced DC-mediated tumor immunity. By contrast, we found that the tumor-associated cytokine IL-6 represses Id2 expression in DCs via STAT3 signaling, rendering reduced DC-mediated tumor immunity. The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which STAT5 and STAT3 control CD103+ DC functional responses remain unclear. These gaps in knowledge are important to address to provide better use of DCs in immunotherapy. Based on our data, we hypothesize that GM-CSF-STAT5 and IL-6-STAT3 signaling have opposite roles in regulating DC anti-tumor activity via their control of Id2 expression in DCs. We will test this hypothesis wit 3 project aims. In Aim 1, we will delineate mechanisms by which tissue- resident DCs stimulate anti-tumor immunity by investigating the roles for STAT5 and its target gene Id2 in CD103+ DCs. We will study whether and how STAT5 and Id2 control CD103+ DC maturation, antigen presentation, T lymphocyte stimulation, pre-DC accrual in nonlymphoid tissue, and DC-mediated anti-tumor activity. In Aim 2, we will elucidate DC-intrinsic signaling mechanisms that regulate DC function in melanoma tumors. We will investigate roles for STAT3 in DCs in Id2 downregulation, immune responses to melanoma and melanoma combination immunotherapy. In Aim 3, we will examine mechanisms by which STAT5 and STAT3 regulate Id2 expression in DC development. We will evaluate whether and how STAT5 and STAT3 control chromatin modifications, co-factor recruitment and RNA polymerase II association at the Id2 promoter in vivo. We anticipate this project to reveal cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CD103+ DC anti-tumor activity is regulated, paving the way for rational investigation into pathways controlling related human DC populations. This information could ultimately provide new opportunities to manipulate DCs in cellular therapy, cancer and/or immune disease.

This risk persists even after adjustment for coronary\nartery disease, implying that immunologic and inflammatory factors intrinsic to RA contribute to the increased\nrisk of HF. Our overall hypothesis is that myocardial inflammation and microvascular ischemia are prevalent in\nRA patients, are mediated by antibodies to myocardial citrullinated proteins, promote impairment of left\nventricular (LV) structure/function, and are attenuated with RA therapies. Indeed, in 128 RA patients without\nclinical CVD who underwent [18fluoro-deoxyglucose] positron emission-computed tomography (FDG PET-CT)\n(the RHYTHM study), we observed FDG uptake (inflammation) in 35% and impaired myocardial blood flow\nreserve (MFR) in 29%. Both myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR were strongly associated with clinical\nand laboratory measures of RA disease activity; impaired MFR was also associated with higher LV mass, a\nknown precursor of HF. These data suggest that myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR mediate, in part,\nearly changes in LV structure/function that predate clinical HF; but it is critical to confirm these relationships in\nlongitudinal studies. Proximal events that mediate myocardial pathology in RA are unknown. We hypothesize\nthat antibodies against citrullinated myocardial proteins (APCAs) mediate, in part, this abnormal myocardial\nphenotype (inflammation and impaired MFR), leading to myocardial remodeling and ultimately to functional\ndecline. Our preliminary data demonstrating seroreactivity in 30% of RHYTHM sera in a novel myocardial\nprotein array support this hypothesis. A related question is whether tumor necrosis inhibitors (TNFi’s) affect\nmyocardial inflammation. This is a far from insignificant question as TNFi’s were associated with increased HF\nhospitalizations and death in non-RA HF patients and their risk for HF in RA is still unclear despite widespread\nuse. In the next funding period, we seek to extend the study period for the RHYTHM cohort for aims 1 and 3,\nand to utilize an independently funded study (TARGET) for aim 2, in order to investigate the following aims:\n1) To determine if imaging indicators of myocardial pathology at baseline (inflammation, impaired\nMFR) are predictive of longitudinal (adverse) change in measures of LV structure and function over 4-6\nyears in RA patients without clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline.\n2) To determine, in a currently enrolling NIH-NIAMS funded randomized clinical trial (the TARGET\nstudy), if RA therapies reduce myocardial inflammation.\n3) To determine if seroreactivity to citrullinated myocardial antigens in RHYTHM participants is\nassociated with baseline myocardial inflammation and impaired MFR and/or with change over time in\nparameters of LV structure/function. These investigations will advance understanding of mechanisms that\ncontribute to and mitigate increased risk of myocardial dysfunction in RA.

The dendritic cell (DC) is a specialized immune sentinel that directs T cells to\ntolerance or immunity. DC comprise a rich network in skin consisting of several different\npopulations, but are understudied, leaving a major gap in therapeutic intervention. We have\nidentified distinct properties for DC in skin that relay information by migrating out to the draining\nlymph node (LN). We find during inflammation skin migratory DC may direct T cells to tolerance\nby unknown mechanisms, counter-regulating and controlling immunity. These cells are uniquely\ngenetically programed in humans and in mouse to dampen immunity with a high expression of\nshared tolerance genes, including some genes such as PD-L1 that have been successfully\ntargeted in the clinic for peripheral tissue cancers including melanoma skin cancer, colorectal\ncancer and lung cancer. We hypothesize homeostatic programming of skin DC leads to failed\nimmune priming leading to impaired early detection of skin cancers. We find these pathways are\nof great importance as therapeutic targets to promote self-tolerance (such as during\nautoimmune disease) or to block tolerance (to improve immunity during cancer). Because these\nmechanisms are distinct they can be combined with current modalities for patients in\nimmunotherapy of skin cancer, vaccine science, and inflammatory skin disease. In 2 discrete\naims, this application will address programmatic conditioning of skin DCs and the unique cellular\nmechanisms by which they promote immune tolerance in both mice and humans, examining\nconsequences during immune priming and early skin cancer growth.

project	5R01CA099326-23	5R01CA099326-23	9263886	2017	Large heat shock proteins and their role in cancer therapy	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New strategies which improve the efficacy of radiation therapy and/or protect surrounding normal tissue from damage can have a major impact on treatment outcome. Recent studies have reinvigorated the hypothesis that the outcome of radiation therapy is dependent upon the anti-tumor immune response and strongly support the testing of new combinations of ionizing radiation with immunotherapy. Heat shock protein (HSP) biology has been central to our research for many years. This work led to a completely new vaccine paradigm based upon the chaperone potential of large HSPs (first discovered by our group) and their ability to stimulate powerful anti-tumor immunity. Large HSPs, including hsp110 and the glucose regulated protein 170 (grp170) are related molecular chaperones that are highly efficient in binding to large substrate proteins. Our team has demonstrated that clinically relevant tumor antigens (e.g., gp100, HER- 2/neu, etc.) can be complexed to these large stress-response proteins by heat shock generating a highly effective antigen-specific, immune response. In a significant demonstration of lab bench-to-bedside research, our preclinical results led to a successful RAID application from the NCI for the development of a novel hsp110-based vaccine now undergoing Phase I evaluation in advanced melanoma patients. In new preliminary and published data, we have discovered that grp170 and pathogen-associated molecules (PAMPs) can act synergistically to stimulate the innate immune response and this is dependent on the chaperoning activity of grp170. We believe that this discovery can result in a novel, multipronged approach to cancer therapy. Therefore, we have engineered a chimeric chaperone, termed Flagrp170, by fusing a truncated grp170 chaperone with bacterial flagellin-derived PAMP which has an NF-kB-activating domain. Since preliminary data show a strong potential for Flagrp170 to provide a radioprotective effect, we hypothesize that this novel agent could both enhance therapeutic responsiveness to ionizing radiation (through enhanced immune responses of the vaccine) and provide critical protection of normal tissue. We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we predict that this chaperoning competent chimeric macromolecule can preferentially deliver selected antigens to specialized antigen-presenting cells and concurrently stimulate the NF-kB signaling for their functional activation. In Aim 2, we will test whether vaccination with Flagrp170 complexed with tumor antigen will generate a more potent and durable immune response than unmodified grp170. In Aim 3, the potential of using Flagrp170 to improve efficacy of ionizing radiation and provide tissue protection against radio-toxicity will be investigated. Successful completion of proposed research will not only provide a better understanding of the multifunctional features of the chimeric chaperone, but will also establish a scientific rationale for design the new generation of HSP-based vaccines to be used alone or in conjunction with the standard-of-care therapies (e.g., radiotherapy) in future clinical trials.

project	5R01CA121118-09	5R01CA121118-09	9269156	2017	A High-Throughput Model for Human Melanoma	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The increasing incidence of melanoma and mortality associated with advanced stages of the disease are cause for concern. Recent reports on the efficacy of therapeutic agents targeting the most common alteration in melanoma, mutant BRAF, have been very encouraging and have shifted the treatment paradigm for this disease. Despite these impressive clinical successes, a significant percentage of patients are intrinsically\nresistant to BRAF inhibitors and those who initially respond ultimately relapse as a result of acquired resistance. In addition, nearly half of all melanomas contain wild-type BRAF and are therefore not sensitive to mutant BRAF inhibitors. While targeted therapies have the potential to revolutionize cancer care by providing personalized treatment strategies that are less toxic and more effective, maximizing their effectiveness requires increased knowledge of the molecular alterations that drive tumor formation, progression, maintenance, and resistance. In vivo models fulfill this need. We have developed a novel mouse model of melanoma that not only aids in the identification and validation of alterations that drive tumor growth but also provides a means to assess tumor progression and efficacy of therapeutic strategies. Importantly, melanomas can be induced in our model using the same genetic alterations observed in the human disease and specific gene combinations result in both lung and brain metastases, which are responsible for nearly half of all melanoma patient deaths. We have observed that despite their high sequence and functional similarity, AKT2 and AKT3 significantly differ in their ability to promote brain metastases in the context of mutant BRAF in vivo. Interestingly, brain metastases are also not observed in mice with mutant BRAF-driven tumors that lack Pten, which is believed to contribute to melanoma development and progression through deregulated AKT activity. We are uniquely poised to investigate the mechanistic differences between these tumors in vivo using our novel mouse model. We hypothesize that the differential ability of the three AKT isoforms and Pten loss to induce brain metastases is due to differential downstream signaling and that genetic suppression of AKT3 in this context will significantly delay the development and growth of distant metastases. To test this hypothesis, we will define the functional domain(s) that dictate AKT isoform specific melanoma brain metastases in vivo, use functional proteomics to identify AKT3-dependent effectors involved in promoting brain metastases, and utilize an in vivo genetic approach to evaluate the effect of targeting AKT3 on melanoma growth and metastasis. We will further validate our findings in melanoma tissue from patients. The long-term goals of this project are to identify targets that promote brain metastases as well as biomarkers that identify the subset of melanoma patients that are most likely to develop brain metastases and would therefore benefit from more aggressive therapy.

Recent reports on the efficacy of therapeutic agents targeting the most common alteration in melanoma, mutant BRAF, have been very encouraging and have shifted the treatment paradigm for this disease.

However, many patients still succumb to the disease and more\nthan half of all melanoma deaths are due to brain metastases. As a means to overcome this challenge, we\ndeveloped a novel mouse model that allows postnatal delivery of genes of interest to melanocytes. Using\ngenomic and proteomic data from human melanoma samples, we tested several gene combinations for their\nability to induce metastatic melanoma in vivo. Hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in the context of mutant\nBRAF and CDKN2A loss resulted in the development of spontaneous melanoma with full penetrance and a\nmean survival of only 6 weeks. The majority of these mice also developed multiple metastases to the lungs and\nbrain. This model mimics the human disease genetically, histologically, and by sites of metastasis. Importantly,\nthis model system provides a powerful platform to further study the mechanisms of melanoma metastasis.\nElucidation of this network will allow the identification of key pathway nodes that represent potential therapeutic\ntargets to disrupt this process. We used next generation sequencing and proteomics analysis of non-metastatic\nand metastatic tumor samples to identify downstream targets of AKT1 implicated in melanoma brain metastasis.\nOur data showed that tumors expressing activated AKT1 displayed elevated levels of focal adhesion (FA) factors\nand phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (P-FAK). In addition, mutant AKT1 expression increased invasion and\nthis was reduced by pharmacological inhibition of either AKT or FAK. Moreover, loss of PTEN, which also results\nin increased FAK activity, cooperated with activated AKT1 to further enhance brain metastasis in vivo. Despite\nthese promising preliminary findings, a critical gap still remains in understanding whether and how FAK promotes\nmelanoma brain metastasis, and whether the AKT1-FAK-PTEN axis can be exploited as a therapeutic target in\nthis disease. Our long-term goal is to use this knowledge to develop novel melanoma therapies and improve\npatient outcomes. Pursuant to this goal, we have generated a diverse collection of state-of-the-art research tools\nand assembled a talented team of scientists and clinicians with a track record of productive collaboration to carry\nout and critically evaluate the results of the proposed aims. Using these unique resources, we propose to test\nthe following hypotheses: 1) AKT1→ FAK signaling is essential for the development of melanoma brain\nmetastases; 2) Combined inhibition of BRAFV600E, MEK, and FAK is superior to standard of care targeted therapy\nand; 3) Loss of PTEN expression results in sustained FAK phosphorylation, which enhances the development\nof melanoma brain metastases. Successful completion of the aims in this proposal will significantly impact the\nfield by laying the groundwork for translation into clinical trials, leading to new and better treatments for patients\nwith brain metastases and those who are at high risk of developing brain metastases.

project	5R01CA124633-10	5R01CA124633-10	9263888	2017	Pathogenesis and Treatment of NUT-Midline Carcinoma	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this project is a rare, highly aggressive, and incurable subtype of squamous cell carcinoma, genetically defined by rearrangement of the NUT gene, and termed midline carcinoma (NMC). The goals of the enclosed proposal are 1) to determine the pathogenesis and 2) effective therapy of NMC.  NMC is characterized by a simple karyotype harboring a single translocation involving the NUT gene with members of the bromodomain-containing BET family, most commonly BRD3 or BRD4. The resultant BRD- NUT fusion protein is causative in this cancer, acting to block differentiation and maintain NMC cells in a perpetually proliferative state. Several pieces of evidence have led us formulate a model whereby BRD-NUT blocks differentiation by sequestering chromatin "writers" necessary for transcription, such as histone acetyl- transferases (HATs), away from genes required for differentiation to limited genomic regions where the bromodomains of BRD "read" and activate transcription of pro-growth, anti-differentiative genes. Indeed, drug inhibitors of the acetyl-histone binding bromodomains (BETi) or of histone deacetylases unblock the BRD-NUT induced blockade on differentiation, resulting in differentiation and arrested proliferation of NMC\ncells in vitro and in vivo. Both approaches have been used therapeutically in patients.  In support of the above model, recent findings indicate that the transcriptional upregulation of the common cancer gene, MYC, by BRD4-NUT is required and can replace BRD4-NUT's function to block differentiation.  The first aim, to identify the molecular mechanisms by which BRD4-NUT leads to the MYC-dependent blockade of differentiation in NMC cells, will be accomplished by isolating and sequencing genes with which BRD4-NUT associates, and correlating with changes that occur in expression of those genes under conditions which promote differentiation in NMC cells. The gene targets of BRD4-NUT identified in these studies will be correlated with findings acquired from the genome-wide siRNA knockdown, which will identify specific genes whose expression is required for the blockade of differentiation in NMC cells. After a list of key target genes is identified and prioritized based on pathway analysis, they will be tested for their\neffects on MYC protein and RNA levels to identify which BRD4-NUT target genes are required to upregulate MYC levels. In addition, identification of BRD4-NUT-containing protein complexes by mass-spectrometry will be performed to identify proteins which collaborate with BRD4-NUT to upregulate MYC.  The second aim, an exploratory aim, to identify mutations in NMC cells that collaborate with BRD4-NUT in the blockade of differentiation and maintenance of growth of NMC cells, will be accomplished by sequencing all coding genes of approximately ten NMC tumors. The purpose of this aim is also to identify mutant proteins which aid BRD4-NUT oncogenic activity that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors in the treatment of NMC.

NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), with a median survival of 6.7 months, is one of\nthe most aggressive solid tumors known. It is a subtype of squamous cell carcinoma characterized by\ntranslocation of the NUT (aka NUTM1) gene, most commonly forming a fusion to the double-bromodomain\nencoding protein (BET), BRD4. There is an urgent need for the identification of more specific therapeutic\ntargets in NMC. The over-reaching goal of this proposed project is to greater understand the mechanism of\nBRD4-NUT oncogenesis and identify effective therapeutic targets for treating this disease.\n BRD4-NUT functions to block differentiation and maintain proliferation of NMC cells, largely through\nactivation of MYC expression. This function is disrupted upon treatment with BET inhibitors, which as acetyl-\nlysine mimetics prevent binding of BRD4 bromodomains to acetylated chromatin. BRD4-NUT drives the\nexpression of pro-growth target genes, including MYC, through the formation of megabase-sized massive\nhyperacetylated 'megadomains'. BRD4-NUT megadomains arise from pre-existing active enhancers and\nspread to fill cell-type-specific topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are higher order genomic\nstructures whose function is to orchestrate cell-fate determining transcriptional programs through DNA-DNA\ncontacts. Unique proteins recruited by BRD4-NUT recently identified by our group include the histone acetyl-\ntransferase (HAT), p300, and several ZNF proteins collectively termed Z4. These findings indicate that BRD4-\nNUT ‘hijacks’ cell-type specific TADs to drive transcription of pro-growth, anti-differentiative genes as\npostulated in the following model: First, BRD4-NUT complex proteins seed regions corresponding to cell-type-\nspecific active TADs through the chromatin-binding of BRD4. Second, megadomains form from contiguous\nexpansion of BRD4-NUT complexes across chromatin in a feed-forward manner dependent upon p300 HAT\nactivity. Third, megadomain size is limited by TAD boundaries and HDAC activity recruited by the Z4 complex.\nFourth, hyperacetylated chromatin, recruitment of chromatin remodelers, and upregulation of cis lncRNAs\nchanges the chromatin configuration to enhance DNA-DNA interactions to drive transcription of key pro-\ngrowth, anti-differentiative genes.

Successful completion of the aims is expected to identify key BRD4-NUT-associated proteins in\npathologic megadomain formation, and will identify novel and possibly more effective therapeutic targets in\nNMC and other cancers. In addition, we predict that BRD4-NUT megadomains will provide a model with far-\nreaching impact on the structure-function relationship of chromatin conformation in cancer and development.

NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), with a median survival of 6.7 months, is one of\nthe most aggressive solid tumors known. It is a subtype of squamous cell carcinoma characterized by\ntranslocation of the NUT (aka NUTM1) gene, most commonly forming a fusion to the double-bromodomain\nencoding protein (BET), BRD4. There is an urgent need for the identification of more specific therapeutic\ntargets in NMC. The over-reaching goal of this proposed project is to greater understand the mechanism of\nBRD4-NUT oncogenesis and identify effective therapeutic targets for treating this disease.\n BRD4-NUT functions to block differentiation and maintain proliferation of NMC cells, largely through\nactivation of MYC expression. This function is disrupted upon treatment with BET inhibitors, which as acetyl-\nlysine mimetics prevent binding of BRD4 bromodomains to acetylated chromatin. BRD4-NUT drives the\nexpression of pro-growth target genes, including MYC, through the formation of megabase-sized massive\nhyperacetylated 'megadomains'. BRD4-NUT megadomains arise from pre-existing active enhancers and\nspread to fill cell-type-specific topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are higher order genomic\nstructures whose function is to orchestrate cell-fate determining transcriptional programs through DNA-DNA\ncontacts. Unique proteins recruited by BRD4-NUT recently identified by our group include the histone acetyl-\ntransferase (HAT), p300, and several ZNF proteins collectively termed Z4. These findings indicate that BRD4-\nNUT ‘hijacks’ cell-type specific TADs to drive transcription of pro-growth, anti-differentiative genes as\npostulated in the following model: First, BRD4-NUT complex proteins seed regions corresponding to cell-type-\nspecific active TADs through the chromatin-binding of BRD4.

project	5R01CA131261-08	5R01CA131261-08	9335275	2017	Studying the initiation, progression and therapy of lung cancer in mouse models	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is a global scourge responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide and ~160,000 deaths in the USA this year alone. Despite the grim clinical picture, cancer genetics has revealed that lung cancers can be divided into genetically-defined subsets based on driver oncogene mutations that, in turn, serve as predictive biomarkers for the clinical deployment of new first-line pathway-targeted therapies in lung cancer patients. However, to date, only a minority of such patients have benefitted from these advances such that treatment options for most patients remain poor and are limited to conventional approaches including surgery, radiation, and/or conventional chemotherapy that are ineffective against tumor cells and toxic to normal cells. The overarching, long-term goal of this research is to aid the deployment of rational, evidence-based therapeutic strategies to treat lung cancer patients. However, the immediate objectives of this proposal are to mechanistically define how parallel pathways, such as WNT→ß-catenin→c-MYC or PI3'-kinase→PDK→AKT signaling, cooperate with oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer. To do so we will use: State-of-the-art genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer; Lung cancer- derived cell lines whose aberrant behavior is driven by relevant genetic abnormalities; Pathway-targeted therapeutics, many of which are in cancer clinical trials and one of which is specifically being tested in lung cancer and; An innovative transposon mutagenesis system to simultaneously elicit lung cancer progression and identify its underlying genetic cause. Building on a solid foundation of studies published in the previous cycle of this grant, in Aim 1 we will identify the tumor cell autonomous mechanisms by which WNT→ß-catenin signaling cooperates with oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer. In Aim 2 we will explore the mechanisms by which PI3'-kinase signaling promotes the proliferative expansion and maintenance of both early- and late-stage BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors. BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors remain uniformly benign unless cooperating genomic events unleash malignant progression. In Aim 3 document the use of Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis to promote progression of BRAFV600E- driven lung cancers. Genetic progression factors identified will be validated using lentivirus-mediated cDNA expression or by in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tumor suppressor gene silencing in the mouse lung. Moreover, we will mine the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma genome, RNA sequencing and RPPA databases to credential genes implicated in our SB screen in mice as being directly relevant to bona fide human lung cancer. Finally, although this proposal is focused primarily on studies of genetic cooperation in the genesis of lung cancer, we will test the anti-tumor effects of novel pathway-targeted inhibitors of BRAFV600E, WNT or PI3'- kinase signaling that are likely to have important translational implications for the design and evaluation of new pathway-targeted strategies to treat patients with this ubiquitous, devastating and poorly understood disease.	1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase;Acyltransferase;Address;Alleles;Apoptosis;Behavior;Benign;Biochemistry;Biological Models;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Patient;Cell Cycle;Cell Line;Cellular biology;Cessation of life;Clinical;DNA Sequence Alteration;Databases;Dependency;Development;Disease;Disease Resistance;Dissociation;Drug resistance;Evaluation;Event;Experimental Models;Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinases;Foundations;Future;Gene Silencing;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Growth;Human;In Vitro;Investigation;Lesion;Ligands;Lipids;Lung;Lung Adenocarcinoma;Lung Neoplasms;MEKs;Maintenance;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Mediating;Minority;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Molecular Mechanisms of Action;Mus;Mutagenesis;Mutation;Normal Cell;Oncogene Activation;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;PDPK1 gene;PI3 gene;PTEN gene;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Phase;Physicians;Play;Porcupines;Prognostic Marker;Protein Array Analysis;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Publishing;Radiation;Research;Resources;Risk stratification;Role;Scientist;Scourge;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Sleeping Beauty;Solid;Specimen;Subfamily lentivirinae;System;Talents;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Therapeutic;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Ursidae Family;Validation;WNT Signaling Pathway;X-Ray Computed Tomography;antitumor effect;base;beta catenin;c-myc Genes;cDNA Expression;cancer clinical trial;cancer genetics;cancer initiation;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;design;evidence base;experimental study;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;lung carcinogenesis;lung tumorigenesis;mouse model;neoplastic cell;novel;predictive marker;public health relevance;response;senescence;statistics;targeted treatment;tool;transcriptome sequencing;translational cancer research;tumor;tumor progression	UNIVERSITY OF UTAH	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	UNITED STATES	MARTIN  MCMAHON	Joanna M.

To do so we will use: State-of-the-art genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer; Lung cancer- derived cell lines whose aberrant behavior is driven by relevant genetic abnormalities; Pathway-targeted therapeutics, many of which are in cancer clinical trials and one of which is specifically being tested in lung cancer and; An innovative transposon mutagenesis system to simultaneously elicit lung cancer progression and identify its underlying genetic cause. Building on a solid foundation of studies published in the previous cycle of this grant, in Aim 1 we will identify the tumor cell autonomous mechanisms by which WNT→ß-catenin signaling cooperates with oncogenic KRASG12D or BRAFV600E in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer. In Aim 2 we will explore the mechanisms by which PI3'-kinase signaling promotes the proliferative expansion and maintenance of both early- and late-stage BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors. BRAFV600E-induced lung tumors remain uniformly benign unless cooperating genomic events unleash malignant progression. In Aim 3 document the use of Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis to promote progression of BRAFV600E- driven lung cancers. Genetic progression factors identified will be validated using lentivirus-mediated cDNA expression or by in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated tumor suppressor gene silencing in the mouse lung. Moreover, we will mine the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma genome, RNA sequencing and RPPA databases to credential genes implicated in our SB screen in mice as being directly relevant to bona fide human lung cancer. Finally, although this proposal is focused primarily on studies of genetic cooperation in the genesis of lung cancer, we will test the anti-tumor effects of novel pathway-targeted inhibitors of BRAFV600E, WNT or PI3'- kinase signaling that are likely to have important translational implications for the design and evaluation of new pathway-targeted strategies to treat patients with this ubiquitous, devastating and poorly understood disease.	1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase;Acyltransferase;Address;Alleles;Apoptosis;Behavior;Benign;Biochemistry;Biological Models;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Patient;Cell Cycle;Cell Line;Cellular biology;Cessation of life;Clinical;DNA Sequence Alteration;Databases;Dependence;Development;Disease;Disease Resistance;Dissociation;Drug resistance;Evaluation;Event;Experimental Models;Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinases;Foundations;Future;Gene Silencing;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Growth;Human;In Vitro;Investigation;Lesion;Ligands;Lipids;Lung;Lung Adenocarcinoma;Lung Neoplasms;MEKs;Maintenance;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Mediating;Minority;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Molecular Mechanisms of Action;Mus;Mutagenesis;Mutation;Normal Cell;Oncogene Activation;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;PDPK1 gene;PI3 gene;PTEN gene;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Phase;Physicians;Play;Porcupines;Prognostic Marker;Protein Array Analysis;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Publishing;Radiation;Research;Resources;Risk stratification;Role;Scientist;Scourge;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Sleeping Beauty;Solid;Specimen;Subfamily lentivirinae;System;Talents;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Therapeutic;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Ursidae Family;Validation;WNT Signaling Pathway;X-Ray Computed Tomography;antitumor effect;base;beta catenin;c-myc Genes;cDNA Expression;cancer clinical trial;cancer genetics;cancer initiation;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;design;evidence base;experimental study;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;lung carcinogenesis;lung tumorigenesis;mouse model;neoplastic cell;novel;predictive marker;public health relevance;response;senescence;statistics;targeted treatment;tool;transcriptome sequencing;translational cancer research;tumor;tumor progression	UNIVERSITY OF UTAH	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	UNITED STATES	MARTIN  MCMAHON	Hector Nelson Aguila	50760	50760	2018-08-08T04:00:00Z	2007-12-01T05:00:00Z	2020-08-31T04:00:00Z	PA-13-302

project	5R01CA143971-07	5R01CA143971-07	9223676	2017	Understanding the AGL metastasis suppressor for therapeutic gain	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer kills 15,000 annually and because of few therapeutic advances there is a need for innovation. This project has discovered suppressors of bladder tumor growth and metastasis and shown that low expression of AGL, an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis, and RhoGDI2, an inhibitor of multiple GTPases, is associated with cancer recurrence and death. The Goal of this continuation project is to understand how reduced AGL levels result in aggressive bladder cancer and to translate this knowledge into novel therapies. We found bladder cancer cells with low AGL express elevated levels of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) synthase 2 (HAS2), and its extracellular product HA, and have activated RhoC and Rac1, known drivers of tumor progression. We demonstrated RhoC/Rac1 activity is suppressed by RhoGDI2, linking the actions of the two metastasis suppressors. Cells with low AGL also exhibit increased glycolysis, glucose import and autophagy. When either glucose import or autophagy are blocked, low AGL tumor cells show greater reduction of in vitro growth than cells with higher AGL levels, exposing a vulnerability of these aggressive cells. These data support an innovative Hypothesis: Tumor cells with low AGL generate growth and metastatic signals via production of HA, activation of its receptors CD44 and RHAMM, and downstream effectors such as RhoC and Rac1. For these signals to be actualized, sufficient energy needs to be provided via enhanced glucose import and autophagy. Three Specific Aims will test this hypothesis. 1) Evaluate impact of HA signaling on aggressiveness of bladder cancers with low AGL. We will determine if HA drives tumor progression via its receptors CD44 and RHAMM and effectors RhoC and Rac1 that are inhibited by RhoGDI2. Experiments will use RNAi and receptor inhibition in human xenografts. 2) Determine role of the AGL signaling network in bladder cancer development and progression. We will evaluate the independent predictive value of tumor suppressor genes and components of the AGL signaling network in a large panel of annotated human tumors, to define a predictive multigene biomarker signature and possible new therapeutic targets. We will use full and conditional (bladder urothelium) AGL knockout mice in a chemical carcinogenesis model that generates spontaneous visceral metastases to test whether lack of AGL makes urothelium more susceptible to carcinogenesis and resulting tumors more aggressive. 3) Target molecular vulnerabilities of bladder cancers with low AGL expression. Here we test whether blocking glucose import and/or autophagy reduces in vivo bladder tumor growth. We will use shRNA and pharmacologic agents already in preclinical/clinical testing. We will screen shRNA libraries to metabolic and autophagy genes in cells with low AGL to discover novel genes essential to the aggressive tumor phenotype, with the expectation that some of these will become therapeutic targets. We will evaluate combined inhibition of HA signaling and energy production pathways with the expectation this will have synergistic detrimental effects on tumor progression. Impact: This project will lay the foundation for future biomarker-driven personalized clinical trials that target critical vulnerabilities in bldder cancer while informing us on how AGL executes its unanticipated role in cancer.

project	5R01CA143971-09	5R01CA143971-09	9778723	2019	Understanding the AGL metastasis suppressor for therapeutic gain	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer kills 15,000 annually and because of few therapeutic advances there is a need for innovation. This project has discovered suppressors of bladder tumor growth and metastasis and shown that low expression of AGL, an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis, and RhoGDI2, an inhibitor of multiple GTPases, is associated with cancer recurrence and death. The Goal of this continuation project is to understand how reduced AGL levels result in aggressive bladder cancer and to translate this knowledge into novel therapies. We found bladder cancer cells with low AGL express elevated levels of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) synthase 2 (HAS2), and its extracellular product HA, and have activated RhoC and Rac1, known drivers of tumor progression. We demonstrated RhoC/Rac1 activity is suppressed by RhoGDI2, linking the actions of the two metastasis suppressors. Cells with low AGL also exhibit increased glycolysis, glucose import and autophagy. When either glucose import or autophagy are blocked, low AGL tumor cells show greater reduction of in vitro growth than cells with higher AGL levels, exposing a vulnerability of these aggressive cells. These data support an innovative Hypothesis: Tumor cells with low AGL generate growth and metastatic signals via production of HA, activation of its receptors CD44 and RHAMM, and downstream effectors such as RhoC and Rac1. For these signals to be actualized, sufficient energy needs to be provided via enhanced glucose import and autophagy. Three Specific Aims will test this hypothesis. 1) Evaluate impact of HA signaling on aggressiveness of bladder cancers with low AGL. We will determine if HA drives tumor progression via its receptors CD44 and RHAMM and effectors RhoC and Rac1 that are inhibited by RhoGDI2. Experiments will use RNAi and receptor inhibition in human xenografts. 2) Determine role of the AGL signaling network in bladder cancer development and progression. We will evaluate the independent predictive value of tumor suppressor genes and components of the AGL signaling network in a large panel of annotated human tumors, to define a predictive multigene biomarker signature and possible new therapeutic targets. We will use full and conditional (bladder urothelium) AGL knockout mice in a chemical carcinogenesis model that generates spontaneous visceral metastases to test whether lack of AGL makes urothelium more susceptible to carcinogenesis and resulting tumors more aggressive. 3) Target molecular vulnerabilities of bladder cancers with low AGL expression. Here we test whether blocking glucose import and/or autophagy reduces in vivo bladder tumor growth. We will use shRNA and pharmacologic agents already in preclinical/clinical testing. We will screen shRNA libraries to metabolic and autophagy genes in cells with low AGL to discover novel genes essential to the aggressive tumor phenotype, with the expectation that some of these will become therapeutic targets. We will evaluate combined inhibition of HA signaling and energy production pathways with the expectation this will have synergistic detrimental effects on tumor progression.

A much larger number of tumors have\namplifications or deletions of these genes. These complexes are polymorphic assemblies of 15 subunits\nencoded by 28 genes giving rise to remarkable combinatorial specificity. This biologic specificity is reflected in\nthe highly selective pattern of oncogenic mutations in specific subunits in specific cancers. Cancer mutations\ngenerally have the characteristics of tumor suppressors and are generally heterozygous, implying that they\nplay a genetically dominant role in suppressing tumor formation. Work in our lab and others has led to the\nconclusion that the ability of these complexes to oppose polycomb-mediated repression contributes to their\nroles in both development and oncogenesis. Hence, we will focus our work on the mechanisms underlying the\nopposition between BAF and polycomb and its therapeutic consequences. First we will use a novel, newly\ndesigned in vivo chromatin remodeling assay to fully characterize the nature of the opposition on a minute-by-\nminute basis. Secondly, we will define the energetic requirements for BAF-polycomb opposition and the\nessential role of ATP in regulating binding and release of PRC1 from BAF. Third, we will fully characterize the\ndirect interaction between BAF and polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in terms of subunits and domains\nthat are essential for this interaction. Fourth, we will explore the consequences of disruption of BAF-polycomb\nopposition for repair, recombination and transcription over the genome.

A much larger number of tumors have\namplifications or deletions of these genes. These complexes are polymorphic assemblies of 15 subunits\nencoded by 28 genes giving rise to remarkable combinatorial specificity. This biologic specificity is reflected in\nthe highly selective pattern of oncogenic mutations in specific subunits in specific cancers. Cancer mutations\ngenerally have the characteristics of tumor suppressors and are generally heterozygous, implying that they\nplay a genetically dominant role in suppressing tumor formation. Work in our lab and others has led to the\nconclusion that the ability of these complexes to oppose polycomb-mediated repression contributes to their\nroles in both development and oncogenesis. Hence, we will focus our work on the mechanisms underlying the\nopposition between BAF and polycomb and its therapeutic consequences. First we will use a novel, newly\ndesigned in vivo chromatin remodeling assay to fully characterize the nature of the opposition on a minute-by-\nminute basis. Secondly, we will define the energetic requirements for BAF-polycomb opposition and the\nessential role of ATP in regulating binding and release of PRC1 from BAF. Third, we will fully characterize the\ndirect interaction between BAF and polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) in terms of subunits and domains\nthat are essential for this interaction.

project	5R01CA175397-05	5R01CA175397-05	9331455	2017	Cancer-associated fibroblast in the regulation of bladder cancer stem cells	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer, the fifth most common malignancy in the U.S. with approximately 70,000 new cases diagnosed each year, is essentially incurable after it has begun to progress. Much of the difficulty lies in the scarcity of mechanistic insightsin the functional involvement of the fibroblastic microenvironment, and its interactions with the epithelial cancer compartment in modulating early bladder cancer invasion. The applicant and his collaborators have made considerable strides in closing this gap. They were among the first to isolate and characterize human bladder cancer stem cells.  Recently, they showed that an expansion of phenotypic cancer stem cells correlates with a poorer clinical outcome and bladder cancer invasion.  Their proposal aims to extend these findings by elucidating the functional contribution of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the modulation of bladder cancer stem cells and tumor progression. This application has its foundation via demonstrating that bladder cancer patients with an elevated expression of CAF genes also have muscle-invasive cancer and a poorer survival.  Moreover, activated CAFs localize immediately adjacent to phenotypic cancer stem cells, suggesting a possible functional interaction between these two cell types.  Additional findings indicate an important role of collagen I (COL1) excreted by CAFs, which can bind to discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (DDR1) on bladder cancer cells and modulate their tumorigenic properties.  This progress has led to a novel working hypothesis - that COL1-DDR1 signaling between activated CAFs and bladder cancer cells is one of the mechanisms exerted by CAFs to regulate cancer stem cells and tumor progression. Three specific research aims will be pursued.  Aim 1 seeks to establish the functional involvement of CAFs in the regulation of cancer stem cells and tumor progression, with an emphasis on using primary patient specimens.  To further define the clinical significance of CAFs, we will utilize tw independent patient cohorts to assess the expression of CAFs/COL1 in relation to bladder cancer differentiation and selected clinical prognostic information.  Aim 2 will employ both gain-of-function and loss-of-function strategies to define the functional contributions of DDR1 on bladder cancer cells to mediate the biological properties promoted by CAFs.  These studies will be aided by the availability of newly isolated bladder CAFs and the applicant's expertise in isolating cancer stem cells for subsequent analysis. Finally, Aim 3 will access Stat3 and additional downstream mechanisms related to DDR1, using established proteomics profiling approach.  The applicant intends to uncover druggable targets within this pathway for early bladder cancer intervention, as the long-term goal of this proposal.

Advanced bladder cancer claims approximately 18,000 deaths annually in the United\nStates; yet, funding and research devoted to this cancer-type are significantly under-proportioned. A major\nclinical setback for bladder cancer treatment lies in the poor patient response towards chemotherapy with\ntreatments providing only a dismal 5% improvement in overall survival. Thus, the goal of this application aims\nto understand the less-studied biology, i.e., cancer cell-extrinsic mechanisms, causing chemotherapy drug\nresistance. The success of chemotherapy is long thought to depend on its direct cytotoxic effects upon tumor\ncells and this has attracted much research interest in the past decades. However, there is growing evidence,\nas shown by our own research and others, that successful chemotherapy is also dependent on: 1)\nfeedforward signals between dying cancer cells and the stromal fibroblast microenvironment, and 2) the\nactive role(s) of collagens secreted from cancer associated fibroblasts to serve as a protective niche for\nchemoresistant cancer cells. Our proposal will leverage existing patient-derived cancer associated fibroblasts\nand patient-derived primary tumor cultures/xenografts developed from the parent grant NCI CA175397,\nwhich allow us to venture into a new research direction: i.e., how cell death associated release of extracellular\nfactors impacts the fibrotic environment, consequently serves as a protective niche to fuel chemoresistant\ncancer cells? This proposal is innovative to elucidate the intricate feedforward loops between dying cancer\ncells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and residual cancer stem cells during the emergence of\nchemoresistance. The success of this study will be innovative and impactful to challenge the current\nparadigm that chemotherapy drug resistance is primarily driven by cancer cell-intrinsic properties. Indeed,\nsuccess of our proposal will establish an original concept: Dying cancer cells provide feedforward signals to\ncultivate a collagen-rich fibrotic environment, consequently initiating a “vicious cycle” of epithelial-stromal\nfeedforward signaling loop to fuel chemoresistance. Also, our proposal will provide new insights into the\nrational design of future intervention strategies to “break” this vicious cycle, and thus, improve chemotherapy\nresponse. Such a concept likely extends beyond bladder carcinomas into other cancer types.	3-Dimensional;ABL2 gene;Amino Acids;Apoptosis;Automobile Driving;Biological;Biology;CASP1 gene;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Patient;Cell Death;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Survival;Cessation of life;Chemoresistance;Cisplatin;Citric Acid Cycle;Clinical;Coculture Techniques;Collagen;Collagen Fiber;Collagen Receptors;Communication;DDR1 gene;Drug resistance;Environment;Enzymes;Epithelial;Epithelial-Stromal Communication;Evaluation;Fibroblasts;Flow Cytometry;Funding;Future;Genetic;Goals;HMGB1 gene;Hydroxyproline;In Vitro;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-1 beta;Intervention;Knock-out;Label;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder;Mediating;Modeling;Nutrient;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Population;Population Heterogeneity;Primary Neoplasm;Proline;Proline Dehydrogenase;Property;Publishing;Research;Residual Cancers;Residual Tumors;Residual state;Role;Signal Transduction;Source;Survival Rate;System;Therapeutic;Treatment Failure;Tumor Tissue;United States;Validation;Xenograft procedure;bladder Carcinoma;cancer cell;cancer drug resistance;cancer stem cell;cancer therapy;cancer type;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;cohort;cytotoxic;design;extracellular;gemcitabine;implantation;improved;in vivo;innovation;insight;interest;multiplexed imaging;neoplastic cell;parent grant;patient response;progenitor;receptor;refractory cancer;response;src Homology Region 2 Domain;standard of care;success;tool;tumor heterogeneity;uptake	CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER	LOS ANGELES	CA	UNITED STATES	Keith Syson SYSON Chan	Elizabeth G Snyderwine	390397	390397	2021-04-22T04:00:00Z	2013-09-30T04:00:00Z	2025-04-30T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-19-049

Current treatment options are of limited effectiveness;\nthus, there is a pressing need for new therapies for this disease. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the\nhistone methyltransferase DOT1L is required for the development and maintenance of MLL-rearranged (MLL-r)\nleukemia in model systems. Likewise, work from the previous funding cycle clearly defined a role for DOT1L\ninhibition in MLL-r leukemia through characterization of a potent, specific DOT1L inhibitor, EPZ-5676\n(pinometostat), that has remarkably selective anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on MLL-rearranged\ncells. As pinometostat has progressed through Phase I clinical trials, responses and subsequent relapses imply\nthe development of acquired resistance to the inhibitor. In this proposal, we seek to understand the biological\nunderpinnings of DOT1L inhibitor resistance and develop a novel class of small molecule DOT1L degraders to\novercome resistance. In Specific Aim 1, we seek to understand the mechanisms of resistance through detailed\nstudies of chromatin structure and gene expression following the development of acquired resistance to DOT1L\ninhibitor therapy. We will also investigate the non-enzymatic role of DOT1L in MLL-r leukemia and define\ndependencies acquired in the resistant state. In Specific Aim 2, we will lead a chemistry and chemical biology\ncampaign and develop an assay platform for the identification and optimization of the first small molecule\ndegraders of endogenous DOT1L protein. In Specific Aim 3, we will utilize our cell culture and patient-derived\nxenograft models of MLL-r leukemia to explore the impact of DOT1L degradation on gene expression and tumor\nprogression while driving hit-to-lead optimization of DOT1L degraders that can prompt clinical investigation. We\nwill also test pharmacological hypotheses regarding combinatorial drug action with DOT1L degraders in\npredictive human models of MLL-r leukemia. We expect these aims to bring new more efficacious, less toxic\ntherapies to children and adults diagnosed with this devastating disease.

project	5R01CA180279-04	5R01CA180279-04	9330108	2017	Three-dimensional Model of Human Ewing Sarcoma	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to apply static and flow perfusion bioreactor culture of bone sarcoma cells, grown upon a tissue-engineered polymer/extracellular matrix (ECM) hybrid model that reliably mimics key features of the bone tumor niche, to advance our understanding of the IGF-1R/mTOR cancer- related pathway and its clinically-relevant resistance mechanisms. Our laboratory has reported in vivo-like IGF- 1R/mTOR expression patterns, closely related to those observed in human Ewing sarcoma tumors (ES), when established ES cell lines are grown upon innovative biologically inert 3D electrospun poly(�-caprolactone) (PCL) microfiber scaffolds rather than upon traditional plastic monolayers. The present proposal seeks to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions stimulate an activated IGF- 1R/mTOR signaling state within this engineered 3D bone tumor microenvironment, as those interactions are critically important in initiating and maintaining ES. In parallel with determining the influence of those parameters under static cell culture, 3D scaffolds and culture conditions will be adapted to better emulate the native bone microenvironment: (a) varied flow perfusion rates will be used to assess the effect of shear stress upon cell retention while facilitating uniform distribution of Ewing cells within the scaffold, (b) PCL scaffolds will incorporate IGF-1 to mimic the high concentration of IGF-1 naturally released as tumors invade surrounding bone, (c) the effect of an osteogenic ECM upon the IGF-1R/mTOR signaling cascade will be determined using decellularized scaffolds upon which heterotypic mesenchymal stem cells, differentiated toward an osteoblastic lineage, are first grown, and (d) ES cells will be co-cultured with endothelial cells (EC) to determine how heterotypic cells interact within a fabricated 3D bone tumor model to elicit viable ES tumors. Finally, to determine the mechanism(s) by which Ewing sarcoma evades sensitivity to combined mTOR/IGF-1R targeted therapy, freshly-derived tumor specimens (obtained from Ewing sarcoma patients treated with Medi- 573/everolimus in an IRB-approved clinical trial), will be grown in primary culture within 3D scaffolds and compared to 2D culture and patient-derived tumor explants (PDTX) by proteomic analysis of the IGF- 1R/mTOR pathway and putative resistance mechanisms. This novel approach of studying Ewing sarcoma within an ex vivo preclinical model of the bone microenvironment presents tremendous potential for understanding chemotherapeutic efficacy and for determining resistance mechanisms to biologically targeted therapies.

project	5R01CA180279-05	5R01CA180279-05	9536714	2018	Three-dimensional Model of Human Ewing Sarcoma	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed research is to apply static and flow perfusion bioreactor culture of bone sarcoma cells, grown upon a tissue-engineered polymer/extracellular matrix (ECM) hybrid model that reliably mimics key features of the bone tumor niche, to advance our understanding of the IGF-1R/mTOR cancer- related pathway and its clinically-relevant resistance mechanisms. Our laboratory has reported in vivo-like IGF- 1R/mTOR expression patterns, closely related to those observed in human Ewing sarcoma tumors (ES), when established ES cell lines are grown upon innovative biologically inert 3D electrospun poly(�-caprolactone) (PCL) microfiber scaffolds rather than upon traditional plastic monolayers. The present proposal seeks to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions stimulate an activated IGF- 1R/mTOR signaling state within this engineered 3D bone tumor microenvironment, as those interactions are critically important in initiating and maintaining ES. In parallel with determining the influence of those parameters under static cell culture, 3D scaffolds and culture conditions will be adapted to better emulate the native bone microenvironment: (a) varied flow perfusion rates will be used to assess the effect of shear stress upon cell retention while facilitating uniform distribution of Ewing cells within the scaffold, (b) PCL scaffolds will incorporate IGF-1 to mimic the high concentration of IGF-1 naturally released as tumors invade surrounding bone, (c) the effect of an osteogenic ECM upon the IGF-1R/mTOR signaling cascade will be determined using decellularized scaffolds upon which heterotypic mesenchymal stem cells, differentiated toward an osteoblastic lineage, are first grown, and (d) ES cells will be co-cultured with endothelial cells (EC) to determine how heterotypic cells interact within a fabricated 3D bone tumor model to elicit viable ES tumors. Finally, to determine the mechanism(s) by which Ewing sarcoma evades sensitivity to combined mTOR/IGF-1R targeted therapy, freshly-derived tumor specimens (obtained from Ewing sarcoma patients treated with Medi- 573/everolimus in an IRB-approved clinical trial), will be grown in primary culture within 3D scaffolds and compared to 2D culture and patient-derived tumor explants (PDTX) by proteomic analysis of the IGF- 1R/mTOR pathway and putative resistance mechanisms.

Both Mdm2 and Mdmx bind and are direct regulators of the p53 tumor suppressor, but their regulation of p53 activation is only partially understood. Moreover, Mdm2 and Mdmx also have other oncogenic functions that are not well characterized and that likely impact p53 activation and significantly contribute to tumorigenesis. Specifically, altered expression of either Mdm2 or Mdmx can lead to genome instability, which is a hallmark of cancer and facilitator of tumor development; however, the mechanisms for this remain unresolved and appear to have both p53-dependent and p53-independent components. Preliminary data suggest novel mechanisms of Mdm2 and Mdmx in the regulation of p53 and the DNA damage response. Therefore, we hypothesize that alterations in these functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx significantly contribute to their oncogenic activity that leads to genome instability and tumor development. We propose to investigate this hypothesis with three Specific Aims. Experiments in Aim 1 utilize innovative approaches to define the novel functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx that result in genome instability during tumorigenesis and the proteins and pathways required. Experiments in Aim 2 will evaluate a novel mechanism of p53 regulation by Mdm2 and Mdmx with multiple approaches, including a new mouse model. Experiments in Aim 3 will capitalize on the novel functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx in targeting an Achilles' heel in cancer cells, and will identify synthetic lethal combination for cells that have lost a functional Mdm2/Mdmx-p53 pathway. Results from these Aims will reveal critical insights into the oncogenic functions of Mdm2 and Mdmx and their roles in tumorigenesis. Our studies should also open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of the 50% of human cancers that have inactivated p53.

project	5R01CA182543-05	5R01CA182543-05	9221976	2017	Biosensor Assay to Screen for Signaling Pathway Inhibition in Cancer	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kinase inhibitors created a new paradigm in chemotherapy and are a major focus of new oncology drug development, but developmental success rates are low (5-10%). Resistance to kinase inhibitors occurs through target-dependent mechanisms (e.g. point mutations that abrogate drug binding) and target-independent mechanisms (e.g. upregulation of alternative signaling pathways, termed "kinome reprogramming"). Therefore, combinations of inhibitors that target several kinases at once are desirable to have a better chance of avoiding the resistance/relapse cycle. Detecting protein kinase activity inside living cells (rather than in lysates or reconstituted systems) is important or understanding kinase inhibitor drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and would lead to better screening for inhibitors likely to make it through the development process. We will develop multiplexed, cell-based assays for specific kinase activities that are important to inhibitor response and kinome reprogramming, and use them to detect kinase activation profiles in patient cells and for inhibitor screens. Phosphorylation of the biosensors is detected using time-resolved lanthanide luminescence measurements, in which Tb3+ emission energy is measured directly via small molecule fluorophores to give different emission colors depending on the fluorophore. In Aim 1, we will establish quantitative assays for activity (and therefore inhibition) of key kinases in drug sensitive and drug resistant CML cells, profiling the pathway activation phenotypes in therapeutically relevant cellular states. We will use the set of biosensors we have already established in preliminary work, and add biosensors for other kinases as they are developed. The assays will be established with cell lines and samples from CML patients (comparing to healthy controls), and validated with RT-qPCR and SWATH" proteomics. In Aim 2, we will screen for synergies between existing kinase inhibitor drugs and new compounds (via libraries). We will also develop homogenous multiplexed analysis of biosensor phosphorylation using energy transfer from lanthanides to organic dyes. In Aim 3, we expand the biosensor design pipeline to develop new, non-natural peptide substrates to use as biosensors for other kinases. The work described in this aim will add to the set of biosensors we already have available. Completion of the work described in this proposal will give us a novel assay for multiple kinases, a suite of new biosensors as well as new and refined detection strategies to use in screening. Drug discovery will benefit from this technology's ability to address kinome reprogramming mechanisms by targeting several kinases at a time. Drug development will benefit from companion assays for multiple targets that could follow a drug or drug combination through the hit to lead transition, target validation, pre-clinical studies, clinial trials, and beyond into treatment management. This assay and its associated tools will contribute to the next generation of targeted therapy development in cancer by breaking new ground in our ability to model the disease environment during drug screening and development.

The assays will be established with cell lines and samples from CML patients (comparing to healthy controls), and validated with RT-qPCR and SWATH" proteomics. In Aim 2, we will screen for synergies between existing kinase inhibitor drugs and new compounds (via libraries). We will also develop homogenous multiplexed analysis of biosensor phosphorylation using energy transfer from lanthanides to organic dyes. In Aim 3, we expand the biosensor design pipeline to develop new, non-natural peptide substrates to use as biosensors for other kinases. The work described in this aim will add to the set of biosensors we already have available. Completion of the work described in this proposal will give us a novel assay for multiple kinases, a suite of new biosensors as well as new and refined detection strategies to use in screening. Drug discovery will benefit from this technology's ability to address kinome reprogramming mechanisms by targeting several kinases at a time. Drug development will benefit from companion assays for multiple targets that could follow a drug or drug combination through the hit to lead transition, target validation, pre-clinical studies, clinial trials, and beyond into treatment management. This assay and its associated tools will contribute to the next generation of targeted therapy development in cancer by breaking new ground in our ability to model the disease environment during drug screening and development.

Resistance to kinase inhibitors occurs through target-dependent mechanisms (e.g. point mutations that abrogate drug binding) and target-independent mechanisms (e.g. upregulation of alternative signaling pathways, termed "kinome reprogramming"). Therefore, combinations of inhibitors that target several kinases at once are desirable to have a better chance of avoiding the resistance/relapse cycle. Detecting protein kinase activity inside living cells (rather than in lysates or reconstituted systems) is important or understanding kinase inhibitor drug sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and would lead to better screening for inhibitors likely to make it through the development process. We will develop multiplexed, cell-based assays for specific kinase activities that are important to inhibitor response and kinome reprogramming, and use them to detect kinase activation profiles in patient cells and for inhibitor screens. Phosphorylation of the biosensors is detected using time-resolved lanthanide luminescence measurements, in which Tb3+ emission energy is measured directly via small molecule fluorophores to give different emission colors depending on the fluorophore.

project	5R01CA187076-04	5R01CA187076-04	9319538	2017	The role of the PI3K pathway in immune resistance	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple immunotherapies have demonstrated long-term clinical benefit in patients with melanoma. Clinical trials are currently underway to build upon this activity in melanoma, and to see if similar benefits can be achieved in other cancers. Despite the advances made over the last few years, there is currently limited understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy. An improved understanding of resistance may identify patients that are most likely to benefit from current immunotherapies. Further, identification of resistance mechanisms that are targetable may lead to combinations that are more effective. Previously we demonstrated that targeting BRAFV600 mutations, which are the most common somatic alterations in melanoma, increases the efficacy of immune-mediated killing of tumors through multiple mechanisms, leading to ongoing clinical trials. Recently, we have found evidence that loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which occurs in 20-30% of melanomas with BRAFV600 mutations, may also contribute to resistance to immunotherapy. Our preliminary experiments show that loss of PTEN in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells inhibits T-cell mediated killing of melanomas in vitro , decreases intratumoral accumulation of tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) in vivo, and correlates with reduced success of TIL expansion from patients. Our data also demonstrates that loss of PTEN correlates with inferior clinical outcomes among BRAF-mutant melanoma patients, reinforcing the clinical significance of this subpopulation. Loss of PTEN results in marked activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, a pathway for which many targeted agents are available and currently undergoing clinical testing. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the PI3K-AKT pathway in tumor cells is the critical mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy in BRAF-mutant melanomas, and that inhibition of this pathway will increase the efficacy of T-cell mediated immunotherapy. In order to test this hypothesis, we will utilize multiple unique clinical and preclinical resources that we have established to develop\nmore effective therapeutic approaches for melanoma patients. First, we will utilize our preclinical\nmodels and diagnostic platforms to interrogate the mechanisms that underlie resistance to T-cell mediated killing and trafficking of T cells to melanoma with loss of PTEN. Second, we will analyze specimens from several cohorts of melanoma patients to determine the immunological features and immunotherapy treatment outcomes associated with PTEN loss. Finally, we will determine the effects of PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors, alone and in combination with FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors, on T-cell viability, function, and anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vio. Together these studies will improve our understanding of the role and therapeutic potential of the PI3K-AKT pathway in resistance to immunotherapy in melanoma. Further, as the PI3K-AKT pathway is implicated in multiple tumor types in which immunotherapies are being tested, the findings may have broad applications for cancer patients.

project	5R01CA187532-03	5R01CA187532-03	9228985	2017	Imaging Habitats in Sarcoma	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tissue cancers, with over 50 histological sub-types. Regardless of type, virtually all STS are treated the same; i.e. with doxorubicin (DOX) followed by resection, if possible. More than 20% of STS are non-resectable and, of those that are, more than 20% recur. For non-resectable or recurring patients, median survival is a dismal 18 months. Perhaps because of its rarity, no new front-line agents have been developed for STS in decades. Among newer agents being developed for STS, TH-302 is showing exceptional promise. TH-302 is an alkylating pro-drug that is activated only in regions of severe hypoxia, and is currently in a phas III trial in combination with DOX in unresectable STS. The primary endpoint of this trial is overal survival with a secondary endpoint of objective radiological response with RECIST 1.1. RECIST responses rarely correlate with survival responses in soft tissue sarcomas, however. The purpose of this work is to develop MR imaging biomarkers that can predict response to DOX and/or TH-302, with the overarching hypothesis that distinct MRI-defined sub-regions of tumors will have differential responses to these agents. Because these sub-regions are defined by their distinct physiology illuminated by combining multiple MR scans, we have termed these as distinct "habitats". Because TH-302 is active only in hypoxia, and hypoxia should be represented by a specific habitat, we specifically hypothesize that imaging of the hypoxic habitat can be used to predict and monitor responses to TH-302. The hypoxia habitat is classified as having low perfusion and high cell density. In contrast, the DOX-responsive habitat should be well perfused (yielding higher drug concentrations) and have high cell density (with more drug targets). This represents a conceptual advance as such habitats may provide a common predictive biomarker across the multiple histological sub-types of STS for patient stratification and therapeutic decision support.

Preclinical work is justified in that there is greater flexibility to interrogate a wider porfolio of MRI pulse sequences and treatment strategies that can be related to underlying histology and molecular profiling. Aim 1 will quantitatively compare MR-visible habitats to histology and molecular profiles of xenotransplanted tumors. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that tumors with different habitat profiles will be differentially responsive to DOX and/or TH-302. In Aim 3, we wil investigate the effects of metabolic perturbations to affect the hypoxic habitat and thus improve response to TH-302. At the end of this study, we will have developed a new set of MR imaging biomarkers for predicting and monitoring response in this heterogeneous group of diseases, with the expectation that these finding will inform a follow-on study in the clinic.

Regardless of type, virtually all STS are treated the same; i.e. with doxorubicin (DOX) followed by resection, if possible. More than 20% of STS are non-resectable and, of those that are, more than 20% recur. For non-resectable or recurring patients, median survival is a dismal 18 months. Perhaps because of its rarity, no new front-line agents have been developed for STS in decades. Among newer agents being developed for STS, TH-302 is showing exceptional promise. TH-302 is an alkylating pro-drug that is activated only in regions of severe hypoxia, and is currently in a phas III trial in combination with DOX in unresectable STS. The primary endpoint of this trial is overal survival with a secondary endpoint of objective radiological response with RECIST 1.1. RECIST responses rarely correlate with survival responses in soft tissue sarcomas, however. The purpose of this work is to develop MR imaging biomarkers that can predict response to DOX and/or TH-302, with the overarching hypothesis that distinct MRI-defined sub-regions of tumors will have differential responses to these agents. Because these sub-regions are defined by their distinct physiology illuminated by combining multiple MR scans, we have termed these as distinct "habitats". Because TH-302 is active only in hypoxia, and hypoxia should be represented by a specific habitat, we specifically hypothesize that imaging of the hypoxic habitat can be used to predict and monitor responses to TH-302. The hypoxia habitat is classified as having low perfusion and high cell density. In contrast, the DOX-responsive habitat should be well perfused (yielding higher drug concentrations) and have high cell density (with more drug targets).

While a great deal of effort has focused on new therapeutic approaches for EOC patients, EOC mortality rates have not markedly improved over the past decades. There is increasing interest in developing novel immunotherapeutic strategies, which require correlative studies to identify targets and patients who are most likely to benefit from these therapies. In the proposed study, we intend to study previously unexplored immune markers as predictors for outcomes among invasive serous EOC patients. Our preliminary results show that in patients with advanced EOC, mitochondrial products of cellular damage are released into the extracellular environment where they activate neutrophils. These stimulated neutrophils generate reactive oxidants and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a distinct mode of neutrophil death characterized by breakdown of membranes and extracellular release of stretches of DNA, histones, and proteases. While NETs function to defend against infection, in the tumor microenvironment, they are expected to facilitate invasion and metastasis. We will study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), as a measure of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and their relationship to NETs in women with invasive serous EOC. We propose in Specific Aim 1 to evaluate the role of mtDNA levels in paired pre-treatment serum and ascites samples in predicting relapse within the first year, PFS and OS in patients with advanced serous EOC. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of neutrophils and NET markers in blood, ascites and tumors in invasive serous EOC outcomes. In Specific Aim 3, we intend to develop a new prognostic signature for patients with advanced serous EOC that incorporates the independent and combined effects of mtDNA, NET markers, and standard prognostic variables. To accomplish these Specific Aims, we will take advantage of, and expand on, an established collaborative infrastructure for sample collection and banking procedures to support evaluation of novel prognostic biomarkers for EOC. We will utilize a cohort of patients currently being recruited at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) to develop the prognostic signature, and similarly treated patients being enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) will be an independent validation cohort for findings in Specific Aim 3. Accomplishment of these aims will establish novel immune-based biomarkers for prognosis in EOC, and may create the foundation for new targets for immunotherapy.

We propose in Specific Aim 1 to evaluate the role of mtDNA levels in paired pre-treatment serum and ascites samples in predicting relapse within the first year, PFS and OS in patients with advanced serous EOC. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of neutrophils and NET markers in blood, ascites and tumors in invasive serous EOC outcomes. In Specific Aim 3, we intend to develop a new prognostic signature for patients with advanced serous EOC that incorporates the independent and combined effects of mtDNA, NET markers, and standard prognostic variables. To accomplish these Specific Aims, we will take advantage of, and expand on, an established collaborative infrastructure for sample collection and banking procedures to support evaluation of novel prognostic biomarkers for EOC. We will utilize a cohort of patients currently being recruited at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) to develop the prognostic signature, and similarly treated patients being enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) will be an independent validation cohort for findings in Specific Aim 3. Accomplishment of these aims will establish novel immune-based biomarkers for prognosis in EOC, and may create the foundation for new targets for immunotherapy.

Our goal is to develop an ex vivo model of\nhuman neutrophil responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that incorporates gene editing as a tool to\ndelineate the effects of neutrophil responses at the genetic level. In the awarded R01, we proposed a model in\nwhich damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and other products of necrosis are released in the TME\nand promote recruitment of neutrophils and induce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a distinct pro-\ninflammatory and injurious mode of neutrophil death that accelerates metastasis in tumor-bearing mouse\nmodels. We found that ascites mitochondrial DNA (a DAMP that activates neutrophils) and neutrophil elastase\nlevels (a product of primary neutrophil granules released during degranulation and NETs) correlated with\nworse PFS in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We also observed that\ncirculating neutrophils from patients with newly diagnosed metastatic EOC were morphologically mature and\nnot intrinsically suppressive, but acquired a suppressor phenotype (as defined by ≥ 1 log10 reduction of anti-\nCD3/CD28-stimulated T cell proliferation) after ascites supernatant exposure. This neutrophil suppressor\nphenotype was dependent on a number of neutrophil effector functions, including complement signaling, and is\ndistinct from granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and tumor-associated N2 neutrophils.\nTaken together, our results support a model in which DAMPs recruit neutrophils to the EOC microenvironment\nwhere they can drive tumor progression through NETs and induce suppressor neutrophils that are a barrier to\nanti-tumor immunity. Obstacles to the study of neutrophils in the TME are that mature neutrophils are\nterminally differentiated, short-lived, and not amenable to genetic modification. Genetically modified mice and\nmyeloid cell lines are widely used systems for evaluation of neutrophil functions, but don't permit evaluation of\nthe role of specific genes in primary human neutrophils in clinically relevant models of the TME. The Specific\nAim of the supplement is to use an established CRISPR-Cas9 editing platform to test the role of specific\nneutrophil effector functions that drive the suppressor phenotype in EOC ascites, an authentic component of\nthe human TME. Accomplishment of this aim will establish the foundation for applying CRISPR-Cas9 editing\ntechnology to probe human neutrophil responses at the single gene level in the TME, and will advance an ex\nvivo model system expected to be a valuable resource for immuno-oncology research.

The precursor lesion for TNBC is poorly characterized and the pathophysiology of TNBC is not well understood so therapies often fail to achieve complete pathological response and the disease is frequently non-curative. This proposal aims to clarify the molecular pathology of TNBC so that biomarkers for early diagnosis, prevention strategies and curative therapies can be developed. In our high-risk, multi-institutional cohort, with a high percent of AA women, we found that during\nbreast cancer initiation, pStat3 is high as is ECM stiffness and integrin/YAP mechanosignaling, and miRNAs implicated in tumor progression/aggression. TNBCs had the highest inflammation, pStat3 and miR-18a, the stiffest ECM and the lowest miR-203. Mouse studies indicated preventing inflammation decreases fibrosis and that reducing ECM stiffening lower pStat3 and inflammation and EMT and metastasis. Driving mammary mechanosignaling induced miR-18a and EMT and enhanced tumor aggression/metastasis. This suggests that an activated Stat3/tissue tension feedback loop, linked to tissue inflammation, promotes TNBC by engaging mechanosignaling pathways that alter miRs and induce an EMT and tumor aggression. While some breast cancers arise from focal lesions, TNBCs often appear to arise diffusely. We predict that in women at high-risk for TNBC (familial association, BRCA1 mutation) there is a dynamic and reciprocal relationship between the "at risk epithelium" and tissue tension that activates mechano-signaling pathways and induces Stat3/miRNA to 1) initiate TNBC, 3) induce an EMT and/or enhance tumor aggression, that 3) can be used to idenify precancerous lesions that have a high likelihood of progression to TNBC, and 4) could be used to monitor efficacy of prevention strategies and identify targets to improve TNBC treatment. We will use preclinical models to test: 1) if there is a reciprocal relationship between inflammation, pStat3 and tissue tension that\npromotes TNBC progression/aggression and 2) if this is mediated through miRs and EMT. We will examine a clinical cohort of high risk women who rapidly develop TNBCs to 3) test the prevalence of this signaling circuit in biopsies from women with TNBC and determine whether these biomarkers can identify precancerous lesions that have a high likelihood of progression to TNBC. Significance: Our studies could transform concepts of breast cancer by demonstrating that tissue tension could molecularly-prime tissue to malignancy. Markers that identify preneoplastic changes in TNBC, that could be used to monitor efficacy of risk reduction strategies, would have a transformative impact on TNBC mortality rates and particularly AA women.

In contrast to most other cancer treatments, immunotherapy can induce durable clinical response in metastatic disease. Antibodies targeting PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 have shown significant clinical activity in multiple diseases. Importantly, dramatic clinical responses have been seen in patients with the metastatic bladder, a disease in which no new drugs have been approved for over 20 years.

We will perform a clinical study administering anti-PD-L1 antibody in patients with localized bladder cancer prior to these patients undergoing planned surgery for their cancer. We propose to study the effects of anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment not just in the blood but within the actual tumor. We will determine whether this immunotherapy increases the number of T cells into the tumor by examining tissues from biopsies obtained before treatment and from the bladder tumor resected following treatment.

In contrast to most other cancer treatments, immunotherapy can induce durable clinical response in metastatic disease. Antibodies targeting PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 have shown significant clinical activity in multiple diseases. Importantly, dramatic clinical responses have been seen in patients with the metastatic bladder, a disease in which no new drugs have been approved for over 20 years. The mechanism by which these immunotherapies work in cancer patients is unknown, nor are there robust biomarkers that predict of response to these treatments.  We will perform a clinical study administering anti-PD-L1 antibody in patients with localized bladder cancer prior to these patients undergoing planned surgery for their cancer. We propose to study the effects of anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment not just in the blood but within the actual tumor. We will determine whether this immunotherapy increases the number of T cells into the tumor by examining tissues from biopsies obtained before treatment and from the bladder tumor resected following treatment. We will use next generation sequencing to track individual T cell clones in the blood and tumors to also determine whether T cells present in the tumor are being recruited to the tumor site or were already at the tumor. We will study how this treatment activates a systemic immune response.  Understanding how these treatments work within patients, including at the level of the tumor tissue, will provide avenues t improve the efficacy of this approach and/or develop biomarkers to identify those patients that can benefit from treatment.

Much of the\nfocus has been place on T cells, in particular via checkpoint therapies such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1. Little is\ncurrently known of how individual populations of myeloid cells can be partners for T cells. We have recently\nisolated rare populations of myeloid cells that appear critical for robust responses but we don't yet fully\nunderstand how they work. We hypothesize that rare stimulatory dendritic cells traffic antigens and stimulate\nT cell according to specialized rules and that harnessing and modulation of this pathway is part of the reason\nthat checkpoint blockades may work. We further hypothesize that specific tissue-based cells are responsible\nfor upregulating the critical cytokine to make stimulatory dendritic cells but that tissue production is\ndysregulated in cancer and possibly improved with checkpoint therapies.\nIn this proposal we will be vastly extending an approach that my lab has been pursuing over the last few years.\nSpecifically we will be extending our cell-biology based studies of these critical cells (Aim1) to understand how\nthey play a fundamental role in antigen trafficking. Additionally, we will seek to understand how they hand off\nantigen to other antigen-presenting cells in the lymph node to engage T cells (Aim2) and how both of these\nprocesses are affected by checkpoint blockades.

Much of the\nfocus has been place on T cells, in particular via checkpoint therapies such as anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1. Little is\ncurrently known of how individual populations of myeloid cells can be partners for T cells.

The intimate\nrelationship between gammaherpesviruses and B cell differentiation is directly linked to the\nlymphomagenic capacity of these viruses. To ensure the establishment of long-term latency in\nmemory B cells, gammaherpesviruses drive a unique polyclonal germinal center reaction during\nearly infection. Germinal center reaction represents a stage of B cell differentiation that is\ncharacterized by rapid division of activated B cells along with genetic instability driven by\nenzymes that either induce DNA breaks or mutagenize DNA. It is not surprising that most\nEpstein-Barr virus-driven B cell lymphomas originate from germinal center or post germinal\ncenter B cells. This robust, gammaherpesvirus-stimulated germinal center reaction is transient\nand returns to near-baseline levels in long-term infected hosts. Importantly, it is not clear what\nattenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. We have identified Interferon\nRegulatory Factor-1 (IRF-1) as the first host factor that specifically attenuates\ngammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. Studies proposed here test the hypothesis\nthat IRF-1 is the critical host factor that attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven expansion and\ntransformation of germinal center B cells throughout life-long infection. The proposed studies\nwill define IRF-1-mediated signaling changes that attenuate gammaherpesvirus-driven\nexpansion of germinal center response and the relative contributions of B- and T cell-intrinsic\nfunctions of IRF-1 to this process. Further, proposed studies will develop a novel animal model\nof gammaherpesvirus lymphomagenesis. Successful completion of the proposed studies will\noffer insights into the tumor suppressor mechanisms of IRF-1 and generate novel animal\nmodels that will be of value to infectious disease, immunology, and cancer fields.

The intimate\nrelationship between gammaherpesviruses and B cell differentiation is directly linked to the\nlymphomagenic capacity of these viruses. To ensure the establishment of long-term latency in\nmemory B cells, gammaherpesviruses drive a unique polyclonal germinal center reaction during\nearly infection. Germinal center reaction represents a stage of B cell differentiation that is\ncharacterized by rapid division of activated B cells along with genetic instability driven by\nenzymes that either induce DNA breaks or mutagenize DNA. It is not surprising that most\nEpstein-Barr virus-driven B cell lymphomas originate from germinal center or post germinal\ncenter B cells. This robust, gammaherpesvirus-stimulated germinal center reaction is transient\nand returns to near-baseline levels in long-term infected hosts. Importantly, it is not clear what\nattenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. We have identified Interferon\nRegulatory Factor-1 (IRF-1) as the first host factor that specifically attenuates\ngammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. Studies proposed here test the hypothesis\nthat IRF-1 is the critical host factor that attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven expansion and\ntransformation of germinal center B cells throughout life-long infection. The proposed studies\nwill define IRF-1-mediated signaling changes that attenuate gammaherpesvirus-driven\nexpansion of germinal center response and the relative contributions of B- and T cell-intrinsic\nfunctions of IRF-1 to this process.

RAF inhibitors\nvemurafenib and dabrafenib improved survival of melanoma patients with BRAF(V600E) tumors. Unfortunate-\nly, responses are usually temporary, followed by development of resistance, most commonly due to ineffective\ninhibition of RAF and reactivation of ERK signaling in the presence of the drug. In addition, RAF inhibitors in-\nduce second site tumors, due to RAS-dependent paradoxical activation of RAF and downstream ERK signaling\nin normal cells. Outside of melanoma, RAF inhibitors showed limited efficacy in patients colorectal and thyroid\nBRAF(V600E) tumors, also due to ineffective inhibition of RAF/ERK signaling in these tumors. More recently,\ncombinations of RAF and MEK inhibitors showed improved efficacy compared to RAF inhibitor monotherapy,\nbut resistance eventually emerges as well. Resistance mechanisms identified to the RAF/MEK inhibitor combi-\nnation are similar to the ones identified for RAF inhibitor monotherapy, suggesting that ineffective inhibition of\nRAF is a critical limiting factor in both contexts. There is thus a pressing need for improved therapeutic strate-\ngies targeting oncogenic BRAF, such that durable responses and minimal side effects can be achieved. Our\nprevious work showed that regulation of BRAF kinase by dimerization determines both the development of re-\nsistance to currently used RAF inhibitors and inhibitor-induced RAF paradoxical activation, but the underlying\nmechanisms remain incompletely understood. Recently, next generation RAF inhibitors with different structural\nand biochemical properties have entered preclinical and clinical development, but the most appropriate clinical\ncontext for their use is unknown. The goal of this proposal is to accomplish a detailed understanding of the\nmechanisms governing the targeting of oncogenic BRAF by small molecules inhibitors and to use this\nknowledge in order to design more effective RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies. More specifically, we\nwill 1) characterize the mechanistic basis of resistance to RAF inhibitors due to BRAF dimerization by linking\nthe conformational changes induced by inhibitor binding to BRAF to the biochemical effects of the inhibitor, 2)\ngain a detailed understanding of the biochemical mechanism of paradoxical RAF activation by inhibitors in cells\nwith wild-type BRAF and 3) identify effective RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies for tumors with dimeric\nBRAF that would overcome RAF dimer-mediated intrinsic or acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors. The mech-\nanistic insights gained by the proposed experiments will enable the rational design of more effective small mol-\necule inhibitors and RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies targeting oncogenic BRAF signaling, with mini-\nmal side effects and prolonged time to resistance.

RAF inhibitors\nvemurafenib and dabrafenib improved survival of melanoma patients with BRAF(V600E) tumors. Unfortunate-\nly, responses are usually temporary, followed by development of resistance, most commonly due to ineffective\ninhibition of RAF and reactivation of ERK signaling in the presence of the drug. In addition, RAF inhibitors in-\nduce second site tumors, due to RAS-dependent paradoxical activation of RAF and downstream ERK signaling\nin normal cells. Outside of melanoma, RAF inhibitors showed limited efficacy in patients colorectal and thyroid\nBRAF(V600E) tumors, also due to ineffective inhibition of RAF/ERK signaling in these tumors.

Resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and apoptosis is the dominant cause of treatment failure.\nThe molecular mechanisms responsible for chemotherapy resistance are poorly understood, hindering the\ndevelopment of therapeutic strategies to induce chemosensitivity. We have found that chemotherapy and\napoptosis resistance in high-risk AML requires aberrant phosphorylation of MEF2C, a key transcriptional\nregulator of leukemia cell growth and survival. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that defining the\napoptotic mechanisms dysregulated by aberrant MEF2C signaling will reveal effective therapeutic strategies to\novercome treatment resistance. The applicant, who is a New Investigator, will test this hypothesis by\ninvestigating the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis resistance in primary human and genetically-engineered\nmouse leukemias. Aim 1 will elucidate both transcriptional and cellular mechanisms of therapy resistance, with\nthe goal of identifying MEF2C targets that are necessary and sufficient for chemoresistance. Aim 2 will pursue\nthe preliminary evidence that MARK family kinases aberrantly phosphorylate MEF2C and devise rational\ncombination strategies to overcome chemotherapy resistance induced by MEF2C phosphorylation.

Successful\ncompletion of this project is expected to yield molecular mechanisms of aberrant survival and chemotherapy\nresistance of high-risk AML, thus providing essential insights into a fundamental biological and clinical problem,\nwhich can be rapidly translated into clinical trials for patients with this disease.	1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase;Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Adult;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Biological;Biological Markers;Cell Survival;Cells;Child;Chromatin;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Combination Drug Therapy;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;DNA Damage;Development;Disease;Epigenetic Process;FLT3 gene;Failure;Family;Gene Mutation;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3;Goals;Grant;Hematopoietic;Human;Human Engineering;Immunodeficient Mouse;Knowledge;Leukemic Cell;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mission;Molecular;Molecular Abnormality;Mutation;NR4A1 gene;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patient Care;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmacology;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Public Health;Refractory;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resistance;SYK gene;Sampling;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specimen;Stem cell transplant;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Failure;United States National Institutes of Health;acute myeloid leukemia cell;base;cancer cell;cell growth;chemotherapy;clinical care;clinically relevant;drug metabolism;high risk;improved;innovation;insight;jun Oncogene;leukemia;loss of function mutation;novel;recruit;response;therapeutic development;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;transcription factor;treatment strategy	SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Alex  Kentsis	Suzanne L Forry	481665	481665	2020-07-29T04:00:00Z	2016-08-22T04:00:00Z	2021-07-31T04:00:00Z	PA-13-302
project	2R01CA204396-06	2R01CA204396-06	10284204	2021	ABERRANT SIGNALING IN ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA	Project Summary\nDespite intense efforts, the long-term cure rates of patients with acute myeloid leukemia are inadequate.\nResistance to chemotherapy is prevalent, and targets for molecular therapies are only beginning to be defined.\nFor example, mutation of genes encoding transcription factors and epigenetic regulators cause most subtypes\nof AML, but their molecular pathophysiology and pharmacologic accessibility remain poorly defined. We have\nnow found that leukemogenic gene expression in AML requires distinct molecular interactions between the\npioneer transcription factor MYB and its coactivator CBP. Remarkably, peptidomimetic inhibitors of MYB\ntranscriptional coactivation exhibit potent anti-leukemia activity in most molecular subtypes of AML while sparing\nhealthy cells. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that defining and blocking the molecular mechanisms of\naberrant transcriptional coactivation in AML will lead directly to improved therapies for patients. Aim 1 will define\nthe molecular mechanisms of aberrant activation of leukemic MYB transcription factor complexes that control\noncogenic gene expression. Aim 2 will pursue the preliminary evidence that peptidomimetic and targeted small\nmolecule inhibitors can be used to dismantle leukemic transcriptional complexes in vivo and develop effective\ntherapeutic strategies using accurate genetic and patient-derived preclinical mouse models. Successful\ncompletion of this project is expected to yield essential molecular mechanisms and effective therapies of aberrant\ntranscription factors and gene control in AML, thus providing essential insights into a fundamental problem that\nremains poorly understood. This should have broad and lasting significance for understanding and treating\nrefractory leukemias in particular and human cancer generally.

While Ewing sarcoma is relatively\nrare, the biology of this disease is also relevant to non-Ewing sarcomas, and to other cancer subtypes, due to\nthe presence of the EWS/FLI translocation, the driving event in this disease. Similar translocations involving\nETS transcription factors occur in other malignancies, including prostate cancer. Thus, understanding the\nbiology of Ewing sarcoma may provide insight into many cancer types. We will investigate the role of\nsecondary genetic events in the pathogenesis of Ewing sarcoma. These secondary events have been\nidentified through next-generation sequencing of primary tumors and cell lines. Specifically, we will evaluate\nthe role of STAG2 in mediating epigenetic and transcriptional changes induced by the driving oncogene in\nEwing sarcoma, EWS/FLI.\nIn Aim 1, we will use genomic approaches (RNAseq, ChIPseq, WGS, etc.) to assess the mechanistic role of\nSTAG2 in the regulation of chromatin architecture, transcription, and aneuploidy in Ewing cells. In Aim 2, we\nwill study the role of STAG2 in progression, maintenance and metastasis in Ewing sarcoma, using functional\nstudies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In Aim 3, we will determine whether there\nis a synthetic lethal dependency on STAG1 when STAG2 is absent in Ewing sarcoma cells. Our central\nhypothesis is that STAG2 loss plays a key role in the epigenetic reprogramming that drives the oncogenic\nfunction of EWS/FLI.

project	1R01CA205426-01A1	1R01CA205426-01A1	9239881	2017	Elucidating genetics of response to immune checkpoint blockade in lung cancer	Abstract\n Immune checkpoint inhibitors like ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) and nivolumab (anti-PD1) are\nrevolutionizing cancer treatment. Understanding the genetic basis of response and resistance to\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors are critical for improving outcomes with current agents and for\ndeveloping new ones. Patients can undergo dramatic remissions after treatment while others reap no\nbenefit. Furthermore, the immune phenotype shows substantial temperospatial variability and is\ninfluenced by multiple variables.

project	5R01CA205967-02	5R01CA205967-02	9248342	2017	(PQ5) Investigation of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity of mitochondrial apoptotic sensitivity	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inter- and intra-tumoral mitochondrial heterogeneity in response to chemical perturbation in cancer Response to therapy is heterogeneous between tumors of different histology, between different tumors of the same histology, and even among different tumor cells within the same tumor. Much of the cytotoxic response to therapy in cancer is governed by the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that heterogeneity in response at all three of these levels is governed by functional and molecular heterogeneity of mitochondria. BH3 profiling provides a functional measure of how close a cell is to the threshold of apoptosis by measuring mitochondrial sensitivity to BH3 peptides, a property we also refer to as apoptotic "priming". We have previously shown, in both hematologic and solid tumors, that pretreatment baseline priming of patient tumors predicts clinical response to conventional chemotherapy. Our approach to understanding response to targeted therapies is distinct. In contrast to the ubiquitous nature of the DNA and microtubules that are the targets of conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapies attack vulnerabilities that are selectively present in certain cancer cells. To identify where these vulnerabilities exist, we briefly (less than 24 hours) expose cancer cells to drugs and measure whether the drugs increase apoptotic priming. We have shown that this approach, which we call dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), can predict death of tumor cells from targeted agents in vitro and in vivo for both hematologic and solid tumors. There are two important advantages of DBP over conventional measures of cytotoxicity. First, DBP can be applied much more efficiently to primary patient samples. Experiments measuring cytotoxicity in cancer cells often require days of culture. Because the long-term culture of primary patient samples is so unreliable, cytotoxic measurements in primary tumors are unreliable. DBP requires no more than a day of ex vivo culture since we measure well before frank cell death occurs, and we have demonstrated its predictive power in primary liquid and solid tumors. Second, there are many useful anti-cancer agents that do not cause frank cell death, but which nonetheless provoke apoptotic signaling that facilitates killing in combination regimens. Classical cytotoxic measurements do not identify these, but DBP does. We propose to study intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity based on differential response to compounds that sensitize mitochondria for apoptosis. We will focus on colon cancer tumors, as we have access to primary and PDX specimens of these tumors. Our main goals are to develop a therapeutic toolbox of potentially useful drugs, determine how best to combine these in a personalized way, and also to understand the molecular basis of the heterogeneity of mitochondrial function that underlies differences in response to these drugs.

Much of the cytotoxic response to therapy in cancer is governed by the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that heterogeneity in response at all three of these levels is governed by functional and molecular heterogeneity of mitochondria. BH3 profiling provides a functional measure of how close a cell is to the threshold of apoptosis by measuring mitochondrial sensitivity to BH3 peptides, a property we also refer to as apoptotic "priming". We have previously shown, in both hematologic and solid tumors, that pretreatment baseline priming of patient tumors predicts clinical response to conventional chemotherapy. Our approach to understanding response to targeted therapies is distinct. In contrast to the ubiquitous nature of the DNA and microtubules that are the targets of conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapies attack vulnerabilities that are selectively present in certain cancer cells. To identify where these vulnerabilities exist, we briefly (less than 24 hours) expose cancer cells to drugs and measure whether the drugs increase apoptotic priming. We have shown that this approach, which we call dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP), can predict death of tumor cells from targeted agents in vitro and in vivo for both hematologic and solid tumors. There are two important advantages of DBP over conventional measures of cytotoxicity. First, DBP can be applied much more efficiently to primary patient samples. Experiments measuring cytotoxicity in cancer cells often require days of culture. Because the long-term culture of primary patient samples is so unreliable, cytotoxic measurements in primary tumors are unreliable. DBP requires no more than a day of ex vivo culture since we measure well before frank cell death occurs, and we have demonstrated its predictive power in primary liquid and solid tumors. Second, there are many useful anti-cancer agents that do not cause frank cell death, but which nonetheless provoke apoptotic signaling that facilitates killing in combination regimens. Classical cytotoxic measurements do not identify these, but DBP does. We propose to study intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity based on differential response to compounds that sensitize mitochondria for apoptosis. We will focus on colon cancer tumors, as we have access to primary and PDX specimens of these tumors. Our main goals are to develop a therapeutic toolbox of potentially useful drugs, determine how best to combine these in a personalized way, and also to understand the molecular basis of the heterogeneity of mitochondrial function that underlies differences in response to these drugs.

project	1R01CA208205-01A1	1R01CA208205-01A1	9403496	2017	Reengineering obesity-induced abnormal microenvironment to improve PDAC treatment	ABSTRACT\nObesity is a worldwide public health problem, and its incidence is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity associates\nwith increased risk and worse prognosis of many malignancies including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\nHowever, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Obesity induces a pro-inflammatory state both locally\nin adipose tissue and systemically in visceral organs such as the pancreas. PDAC is a highly desmoplastic/fibrotic\ntumor in which angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) signaling activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), contributing to\nsolid stress (the mechanical force exerted by the solid components of the tumor). We have recently shown that obesity-\ninduced inflammation worsens the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME), and compromises perfusion,\noxygenation and chemotherapy in PDACs (Cancer Discovery 2016). Our preliminary data suggest that obesity increases\ntumor stiffness and solid stress, which compress blood vessels and hinder the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic\ntherapy. The desmoplastic reaction also promotes pro-survival signaling in cancer cells. We also found crosstalk\nbetween fibrotic (AT1) and inflammatory (interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) signaling pathways in PDACs in obese mice. These\nabnormalities also promote immunosuppression. Building on these exciting findings, we will further dissect molecular\nand mechanical mechanisms and develop novel strategies to overcome these obesity-induced biomechanical barriers\nto successful therapy in PDACs. We hypothesize that targeting AT1 and/or IL-1β will alleviate obesity-induced\ndesmoplasia and reprogram the immune TME. To this end, we will study spontaneous and orthotopic PDAC\nmice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) in both primary and liver metastasis settings. These PDAC models have\nsuccessfully recapitulated clinical disease. We will characterize mechanical properties of PDACs in DIO using a newly\ndeveloped approach together with the assessment of biochemical and cellular microenvironment. We will assess the\neffect of novel TME-activated AT1 blockers (TMA-ARBs), which allow delivery of high-dose ARBs to tumors while\navoiding systemic hypotension We will also study the FDA approved IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) on\nobesity-altered PDAC biomechanics, and on inflammatory cytokines and cells in obesity (Aim 1). We will evaluate if\nTMA-ARBs/ IL-1Ra can reprogram immune TME in PDACs with obesity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how\nelevated solid stress and stiffness alter tumor cells and host stromal cells using in vitro engineered microenvironments\nwith the results being tested in vivo (Aim 3). We anticipate that TMA-ARBs and/or IL-1Ra will alleviate desmoplasia\nand inflammation in PDACs in obese mice, reprogram ECM and immune TME and facilitate both conventional\nchemotherapy and immune checkpoint blocker immunotherapy. If successful, these studies will lead to the\ndevelopment of novel treatment strategies for obese PDAC patients.

Obesity associates\nwith increased risk and worse prognosis of many malignancies including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\nHowever, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Obesity induces a pro-inflammatory state both locally\nin adipose tissue and systemically in visceral organs such as the pancreas. PDAC is a highly desmoplastic/fibrotic\ntumor in which angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1) signaling activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), contributing to\nsolid stress (the mechanical force exerted by the solid components of the tumor). We have recently shown that obesity-\ninduced inflammation worsens the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME), and compromises perfusion,\noxygenation and chemotherapy in PDACs (Cancer Discovery 2016). Our preliminary data suggest that obesity increases\ntumor stiffness and solid stress, which compress blood vessels and hinder the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic\ntherapy. The desmoplastic reaction also promotes pro-survival signaling in cancer cells. We also found crosstalk\nbetween fibrotic (AT1) and inflammatory (interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) signaling pathways in PDACs in obese mice. These\nabnormalities also promote immunosuppression. Building on these exciting findings, we will further dissect molecular\nand mechanical mechanisms and develop novel strategies to overcome these obesity-induced biomechanical barriers\nto successful therapy in PDACs. We hypothesize that targeting AT1 and/or IL-1β will alleviate obesity-induced\ndesmoplasia and reprogram the immune TME. To this end, we will study spontaneous and orthotopic PDAC\nmice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) in both primary and liver metastasis settings. These PDAC models have\nsuccessfully recapitulated clinical disease. We will characterize mechanical properties of PDACs in DIO using a newly\ndeveloped approach together with the assessment of biochemical and cellular microenvironment. We will assess the\neffect of novel TME-activated AT1 blockers (TMA-ARBs), which allow delivery of high-dose ARBs to tumors while\navoiding systemic hypotension We will also study the FDA approved IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra, anakinra) on\nobesity-altered PDAC biomechanics, and on inflammatory cytokines and cells in obesity (Aim 1). We will evaluate if\nTMA-ARBs/ IL-1Ra can reprogram immune TME in PDACs with obesity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how\nelevated solid stress and stiffness alter tumor cells and host stromal cells using in vitro engineered microenvironments\nwith the results being tested in vivo (Aim 3). We anticipate that TMA-ARBs and/or IL-1Ra will alleviate desmoplasia\nand inflammation in PDACs in obese mice, reprogram ECM and immune TME and facilitate both conventional\nchemotherapy and immune checkpoint blocker immunotherapy. If successful, these studies will lead to the\ndevelopment of novel treatment strategies for obese PDAC patients.

project	1R01CA210259-01A1	1R01CA210259-01A1	9333520	2017	Using Technology to Scale-Up an Occupational Sun Protection Policy Program	A key goal in the Affordable Care Act is building a national culture of prevention through workplace health and\nsafety initiatives. To achieve this goal, methods for scaling up evidence-based programs from research to wide-\nscale dissemination are needed to help balance effectiveness and cost. In many cases, there are pressures to\nreduce scale-up costs but at the expense of lower program implementation and effectiveness. A scale-up\nmethod that sacrifices effectiveness but reduces costs and reaches a larger number of employers may be\nacceptable. We will model the effectiveness and cost trade-off, along with the extent and representativeness of\nreach, when scaling up our evidence-based occupational sun protection intervention, Sun Safe Workplaces\n(SSW), for national distribution. The intervention, which relies on personal contact with managers and in-\nperson employee training (SSW-IP), created large improvements in comprehensive workplace sun safety (i.e.,\npolicy adoption and employee education) in a randomized controlled trial. We will compare the existing in-\nperson program delivery methods (SSW-IP) to a lower-cost dissemination method that utilizes Internet\ntechnology (SSW-T), i.e., virtual meetings, social networking, online training, and program materials. The aims\nof the research are to: 1) estimate the program reach (number and representativeness) and implementation\nrates (i.e., adoption of policies and delivery of education on occupational sun protection) achieved by the SSW-\nIP and SSW-T in a model of national distribution to public safety and public works industries; 2) estimate the\ncosts associated with the SSW-IP and SSW-T (i.e., intervention costs and induced employer costs) and compare\nthe estimated program benefits (i.e., policy and education) to cost; and 3) estimate the effect and cost-\neffectiveness of SSW-IP and SSW-T in secondary outcomes of a) changes in workplace environments and\nprocedures for sun safety and b) workers’ sun safety practices. In a 5-year project, SSW-T will be created by\nredesigning our very effective SSW-IP methods to use the latest web conferencing, social networking, and\nonline training technology for dissemination. The implementation rates (defined as policy adoption and\neducation delivery) and costs associated with SSW-IP (n=50 employers) and SSW-T (n=150 employers) will be\nmodeled in a randomized two-group pretest-posttest design, enrolling a national sample of 200 employers (i.e.,\nfirefighting departments and state departments of transportation). Unlike traditional randomized trials, the\nprimary analysis will be of cost effectiveness to test the hypothesis that SSW-T can be delivered cost-effectively\nto an expanded group of worksites producing a lower implementation rate than SSW-IP but at substantially\nlower cost. Secondary analyses will compare the two scale-up strategies on implementation rate, differences in\nrate by employer groups (e.g., size and region), changes to workplace environment/procedures, and employee\nsun safety practices. The findings will have high impact by helping public health practitioners select the best\nstrategy for scaling up evidence-based workplace health and safety programs to achieve this ACA goal.

To achieve this goal, methods for scaling up evidence-based programs from research to wide-\nscale dissemination are needed to help balance effectiveness and cost. In many cases, there are pressures to\nreduce scale-up costs but at the expense of lower program implementation and effectiveness. A scale-up\nmethod that sacrifices effectiveness but reduces costs and reaches a larger number of employers may be\nacceptable. We will model the effectiveness and cost trade-off, along with the extent and representativeness of\nreach, when scaling up our evidence-based occupational sun protection intervention, Sun Safe Workplaces\n(SSW), for national distribution. The intervention, which relies on personal contact with managers and in-\nperson employee training (SSW-IP), created large improvements in comprehensive workplace sun safety (i.e.,\npolicy adoption and employee education) in a randomized controlled trial. We will compare the existing in-\nperson program delivery methods (SSW-IP) to a lower-cost dissemination method that utilizes Internet\ntechnology (SSW-T), i.e., virtual meetings, social networking, online training, and program materials. The aims\nof the research are to: 1) estimate the program reach (number and representativeness) and implementation\nrates (i.e., adoption of policies and delivery of education on occupational sun protection) achieved by the SSW-\nIP and SSW-T in a model of national distribution to public safety and public works industries; 2) estimate the\ncosts associated with the SSW-IP and SSW-T (i.e., intervention costs and induced employer costs) and compare\nthe estimated program benefits (i.e., policy and education) to cost; and 3) estimate the effect and cost-\neffectiveness of SSW-IP and SSW-T in secondary outcomes of a) changes in workplace environments and\nprocedures for sun safety and b) workers’ sun safety practices. In a 5-year project, SSW-T will be created by\nredesigning our very effective SSW-IP methods to use the latest web conferencing, social networking, and\nonline training technology for dissemination. The implementation rates (defined as policy adoption and\neducation delivery) and costs associated with SSW-IP (n=50 employers) and SSW-T (n=150 employers) will be\nmodeled in a randomized two-group pretest-posttest design, enrolling a national sample of 200 employers (i.e.,\nfirefighting departments and state departments of transportation). Unlike traditional randomized trials, the\nprimary analysis will be of cost effectiveness to test the hypothesis that SSW-T can be delivered cost-effectively\nto an expanded group of worksites producing a lower implementation rate than SSW-IP but at substantially\nlower cost. Secondary analyses will compare the two scale-up strategies on implementation rate, differences in\nrate by employer groups (e.g., size and region), changes to workplace environment/procedures, and employee\nsun safety practices. The findings will have high impact by helping public health practitioners select the best\nstrategy for scaling up evidence-based workplace health and safety programs to achieve this ACA goal.

Paradoxically, although estrogens stimulate breast cancers, risk rises markedly after menopause,\nwhen estrogens decrease. After menopause, estradiol falls and estrone is produced largely in fat by\naromatase. Obesity women have high estrone, and both obesity and high estrone, but not estradiol, increase\nER+ breast cancer risk after menopause. Low intra-tumor levels of enzymes converting estrone into estradiol,\nand elevation of enzymes that produce estrone both confer worse ER+ breast cancer outcome.\n Obesity mediates chronic inflammation through NF-κB driven cytokine expression. We showed contact\nbetween invading breast cancer cells and obese adipose tissue induces pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cell\ntypes that stimulate cancer stem cells (CSC) and drive metastasis. Our data suggest that cytokine induction\nafter breast fat:cancer cell contact is estrogen:ER dependent, since blocking estrogen synthesis with the\naromatase inhibitor, letrozole, reduced cytokine induction upon co-culture. While estradiol is known to oppose\nNF-κB mediated inflammation, the role of estrone in inflammation is not known and may differ from that of\nestradiol. We will study how estrone and estradiol, and changes in the ratios thereof before and after-\nmenopause, may influence NF-κB activity and the pro-inflammatory state in obese postmenopausal women.\n We hypothesize that increased estrone:estradiol ratio after menopause shifts ER from an NF-κB co-\nrepressor to a co-activator to up-regulate cytokines in obese adipocytes and cancer cells that drive CSC\nexpansion and metastasis. We also posit that enzymes that convert estradiol to estrone may contribute to the\npoor outcome of ER+ cancers in obesity. Aim 1 will test if estradiol:ER decreases, estrone:ER increases or\ndifferent estradiol:estrone ratios alter ER effects on NF-κB mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine\ngene drivers of CSCs in ER+ breast cancer cells. To test in Aim 2 if estrone cooperates with obesity to drive\nER+ breast cancer initiation and growth, we will co-culture human ER+ breast cancer cells with mammary\nadipocytes from women with different body mass index (BMI) +/- aromatase inhibition and test consequences\non cytokine levels and CSC. We will also implant syngeneic breast cancers into lean or obese wild-type or\naromatase knock-out mice to elucidate if host estrone mediates tumor promoting effects of obesity. Aim 3 will\ntest if overexpression of HSD17B14, that converts estradiol to estrone, increases ER+ breast cancer cytokine\nexpression and CSC in vitro, and increases tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo. We will also compare levels\nof estradiol/estrone interconversion enzymes in breast adipocytes and cancers from lean, overweight and\nobese women. A better understanding of the roles of estradiol and estrone may lead to new strategies for\nbreast cancer prevention and treatment, and to changes in hormone replacement therapies. Shifting toward a\nhigher estradiol: estrone ratio in serum or in breast cancer cells may prove to have therapeutic potential.

Aim 1 will test if estradiol:ER decreases, estrone:ER increases or\ndifferent estradiol:estrone ratios alter ER effects on NF-κB mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine\ndrivers of CSCs in ER+ breast cancer cells. To test in Aim 2 if estrone cooperates with obesity to drive ER+\nbreast cancer growth, we will co-culture human ER+ breast cancer cells with mammary adipocytes from\nwomen with BMI +/- aromatase inhibition and test effects on cytokine levels and CSC. We will also implant\nsyngeneic breast cancers into lean or obese wild-type or aromatase knock-out mice to elucidate if host estrone\nmediates tumor promoting effects of obesity. Aim 3 will test if overexpression of HSD17B14, that converts\nestradiol to estrone, increases ER+ breast cancer cytokine expression and CSC in vitro, and tumor initiation\nand metastasis in vivo. A better understanding of the roles of estradiol and estrone may lead to new strategies\nfor breast cancer prevention and treatment, and to changes in hormone replacement therapies. Shifting toward\na higher estradiol: estrone ratio in serum or in breast cancer cells may prove to have therapeutic potential.\nThis SUPPLEMENT will test if estrone is more effective in stimulating ER+ breast cancer patient derived\nxenografts than estradiol. This will test our original hypothesis and help meet objectives of AIMS 1 & 2. It may\nalso elucidate why ER+ breast cancer PDX have been so difficult to establish in the past. This work will also\nincrease the number of ER+ PDX models for the research community to use for therapeutic research.

Paradoxically, although estrogens stimulate breast cancers, risk rises markedly after menopause,\nwhen estrogens decrease. After menopause, estradiol falls and estrone is produced largely in fat by\naromatase. Obesity women have high estrone, and both obesity and high estrone, but not estradiol, increase\nER+ breast cancer risk after menopause. Low intra-tumor levels of enzymes converting estrone into estradiol,\nand elevation of enzymes that produce estrone both confer worse ER+ breast cancer outcome.\n Obesity mediates chronic inflammation through NF-κB driven cytokine expression. We showed contact\nbetween invading breast cancer cells and obese adipose tissue induces pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cell\ntypes that stimulate cancer stem cells (CSC) and drive metastasis. Our data suggest that cytokine induction\nafter breast fat:cancer cell contact is estrogen:ER dependent, since blocking estrogen synthesis with the\naromatase inhibitor, letrozole, reduced cytokine induction upon co-culture. While estradiol is known to oppose\nNF-κB mediated inflammation, the role of estrone in inflammation is not known and may differ from that of\nestradiol.

Although surgery is effective in early stage cancers, the median survival of women with advanced endometrial cancer is less than one year, and in the past 30 years there have been no major improvements in the treatment of advanced disease.  Neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy significantly increases long‐term survival, and there are no therapies (targeted or conventional) effective against metastatic disease.  Endometrial cancer research has lagged behind other cancers in grant allocation and progress relative to its clinical impact.  More recently, systematic genome‐wide sequencing efforts, such as the National Cancer Institute’s The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have brought the endometrial cancer genetic landscape into much clearer focus.  These studies have yielded many previously unsuspected endometrial cancer tumor suppressor genes (such as FBXW7) altered in a large percentage of cases, and thus of obvious clinical and research significance.  Cancers are complex amalgamations of various cell types that interact in myriad ways not only with one another, but also with the host organism.  Hence, many features of cancer cannot be modelled in vitro.  Consequently, in vivo genetic animal models are needed to further our understanding of these newly‐discovered genetic driver events in endometrial cancer.  Genetically‐engineered mouse models of endometrial cancer have lagged considerably relative to other types of cancer, and such models remain to be generated for most of the frequent endometrial cancer driver events.  One significant limitation has been the lack of fully optimized in vivo genetic models and the genetic tools to generate such models.  We propose to build upon prior efforts and employ a general, validated strategy to build a suite of genetic tools useful for the generation and characterization of diverse mouse models of invasive and lethal endometrial cancer.  The wide availability of this fully‐credentialed suite of genetic tools will bring new investigators into the field and greatly catalyze the development and use of clinically‐relevant mouse models of endometrial cancer.  These models and the diverse array of translational investigations they will foster will lead to new insights into the biology of these endometrial cancer driver genes and also aid in the identification of potential Achilles’ heels that can be exploited for treatment.\n \n 	Ablation;Age;Alleles;Animal Cancer Model;Animal Genetics;Animal Model;Animals;Biological;Biological Models;Biology;Cancer Model;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Research;Complex;Credentialing;Development;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Endometrial;Endometrial Carcinoma;Endometrial Neoplasms;Epithelial Cells;Epithelium;Estrogens;Event;FBXW7 gene;Female;Fostering;Future;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Recombination;Genetic Transcription;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Human;Image;Imagery;Incidence;Investigation;Lead;Life;Luciferases;Maintenance;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Modeling;Monitor;Mosaicism;Mouse Strains;Mutate;Mutation;National Cancer Institute;Neoplasm Metastasis;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organism;PTEN gene;Pattern;Penetrance;Performance;Proteins;Proteomics;Radiation therapy;Reporter;Research Personnel;Specificity;System;Testing;Tetanus Helper Peptide;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Tissues;Translational Research;Tumor Promotion;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Ubiquitination;Uterus;Variant;Woman;advanced disease;anticancer research;base;cancer genetics;cancer therapy;cancer type;cell type;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;combinatorial;exome sequencing;flexibility;genome-wide;improved;in vitro Model;in vivo;in vivo Model;insight;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;oncogene addiction;pre-clinical;prevent;prognostic;reproductive tract;response;targeted treatment;theranostics;tool;translational cancer research;translational study;tumor;ubiquitin-protein ligase	UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER	DALLAS	TX	UNITED STATES	DIEGO H CASTRILLON	Neeraja  Sathyamoorthy	570932	570932	2017-03-03T05:00:00Z	2017-03-03T05:00:00Z	2020-02-28T05:00:00Z	PAR-16-059

project	5R01CA211339-03	5R01CA211339-03	9646342	2019	Next-Generation Mouse Models of Endometrial Cancer	Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive tract and the fourth most common cancer in women, and its incidence is increasing.  Although surgery is effective in early stage cancers, the median survival of women with advanced endometrial cancer is less than one year, and in the past 30 years there have been no major improvements in the treatment of advanced disease.  Neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy significantly increases long‐term survival, and there are no therapies (targeted or conventional) effective against metastatic disease.  Endometrial cancer research has lagged behind other cancers in grant allocation and progress relative to its clinical impact.  More recently, systematic genome‐wide sequencing efforts, such as the National Cancer Institute’s The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have brought the endometrial cancer genetic landscape into much clearer focus.  These studies have yielded many previously unsuspected endometrial cancer tumor suppressor genes (such as FBXW7) altered in a large percentage of cases, and thus of obvious clinical and research significance.  Cancers are complex amalgamations of various cell types that interact in myriad ways not only with one another, but also with the host organism.  Hence, many features of cancer cannot be modelled in vitro.  Consequently, in vivo genetic animal models are needed to further our understanding of these newly‐discovered genetic driver events in endometrial cancer.  Genetically‐engineered mouse models of endometrial cancer have lagged considerably relative to other types of cancer, and such models remain to be generated for most of the frequent endometrial cancer driver events.  One significant limitation has been the lack of fully optimized in vivo genetic models and the genetic tools to generate such models.  We propose to build upon prior efforts and employ a general, validated strategy to build a suite of genetic tools useful for the generation and characterization of diverse mouse models of invasive and lethal endometrial cancer.  The wide availability of this fully‐credentialed suite of genetic tools will bring new investigators into the field and greatly catalyze the development and use of clinically‐relevant mouse models of endometrial cancer.

Mice can also be\ngenetically engineered to study specific oncogenic pathways. Given the many positives associated with murine\nmodels, the vast majority of pre-clinical anti-cancer therapeutic studies are performed in a mouse.\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of oncology drugs (~94%) that are effective in murine tumor studies will\nultimately fail when tested in humans. These failures cost billions of dollars and waste physician and patient\nresources. Clearly, current preclinical mouse tumor models are not accurately predicting a patients’ response\nto therapy. Thus current mouse models need to be improved to more accurately reflect human disease. Each\nof the currently available mouse models of human cancer has distinct strengths, but also critical flaws. One\ncritical flaw in all available preclinical models is the lack of human tumor stroma. However, work from our\ngroup and others demonstrates that human tumor stroma is a critical component of the human tumor\nmicroenvironment which promotes human tumor growth, metastasis, suppresses anti-tumor immunity, and\ninduces therapeutic resistance.\nOur long term goal is to develop a human tumor model that will, by better representing human tumors, will\nbetter cancer therapeutic response seen in human clinical trials. We hypothesize that a human tumor model\nwith both human cancer cells and human tumor stroma will better represent primary human disease. As such,\nit will be a better/more stringent model for preclinical drug screening that could ultimately prevent a drug which\nis destined to fail from being used in clinical trials. We further hypothesize that human tumor stroma will better\nmaintain tumor cell heterogeneity over time to more accurately reflect the natural evolution of therapeutic\nresistance. Finally such a model will be ideal for evaluating the impact of human tumor stroma on novel\nimmune cell therapies. We propose to use a combination of human adult stem cells and cancer associated\nstem cells to create human tumor model with both human cancer cells and stromal cells. We will perform\nextensive histological and molecular profiling to confirm this model reflects primary tumor. Finally, we will (i)\nevaluate the models ability to predict patient response to disease in a retrospective study and (ii) assess the\nuse of this model to evaluate novel immunotherapies using a novel CAR T-cell construct targeting ovarian\ncancer cells.

Mice can also be\ngenetically engineered to study specific oncogenic pathways. Given the many positives associated with murine\nmodels, the vast majority of pre-clinical anti-cancer therapeutic studies are performed in a mouse.\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of oncology drugs (~94%) that are effective in murine tumor studies will\nultimately fail when tested in humans. These failures cost billions of dollars and waste physician and patient\nresources. Clearly, current preclinical mouse tumor models are not accurately predicting a patients’ response\nto therapy. Thus current mouse models need to be improved to more accurately reflect human disease. Each\nof the currently available mouse models of human cancer has distinct strengths, but also critical flaws. One\ncritical flaw in all available preclinical models is the lack of human tumor stroma. However, work from our\ngroup and others demonstrates that human tumor stroma is a critical component of the human tumor\nmicroenvironment which promotes human tumor growth, metastasis, suppresses anti-tumor immunity, and\ninduces therapeutic resistance.\nOur long term goal is to develop a human tumor model that will, by better representing human tumors, will\nbetter cancer therapeutic response seen in human clinical trials. We hypothesize that a human tumor model\nwith both human cancer cells and human tumor stroma will better represent primary human disease. As such,\nit will be a better/more stringent model for preclinical drug screening that could ultimately prevent a drug which\nis destined to fail from being used in clinical trials. We further hypothesize that human tumor stroma will better\nmaintain tumor cell heterogeneity over time to more accurately reflect the natural evolution of therapeutic\nresistance. Finally such a model will be ideal for evaluating the impact of human tumor stroma on novel\nimmune cell therapies. We propose to use a combination of human adult stem cells and cancer associated\nstem cells to create human tumor model with both human cancer cells and stromal cells.

Pancreatic intra-epithelial neoplasias (PanINs)\nrepresent an early, localized developmental stage of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), when\ncurative surgical resection remains feasible. Understanding features of PDA precursor lesions like\nPanINs could generate new strategies for early PDA diagnosis and intervention.

Upon orthotopic\ntransplantation these immortalized clones produce stable human induced pancreatic intra-epithelial\nneoplasias (hiPanINs). Moreover, these PanIN lesions appear to be stable: after 6 months, they do not\ninvade locally or metastasize. Here we propose to validate and optimize this new system for generating\nstable human PanIN-like lesions to enhance its uses for addressing unmet translational needs. In Aim 1\nwe propose to generate new hiPanIN clones whose mutational spectrum matches that found in native\nPanIN and PDA development. We will also assess prioritized biomarkers identified in the hiPanIN system\nin native human PanIN and PDA specimens. In Aim 2 we propose collaborative studies to test whether\npancreatitis, further genetic modification, or extrinsic signals relevant to PDA can promote invasive or\nmetastatic PDA in the hiPanIN orthotopic transplantation model.

This caveat is particularly relevant for melanoma, given the pivotal role the immune system plays in\nits development. To address these limitations, we plan to study melanoma biology and therapy in a humanized\nmouse (HM) model. We initially developed a mis-matched HM (mHM; tumor and hematopoietic stem cells\n[HSCs] from different sources), and now have generated an autologous HM (aHM; tumor, HSCs and\nmesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] from the same patient). In HM bearing tumors the human immune and\nmesenchymal cells from the patient's bone marrow homed into the growing tumor, migrated into the pre-\nexisting mouse stroma, and interacted with the human cancer cells. Tumors grown in HM more closely\nresembled the originator tumor than those grown in non-HM mice, and the drift in gene expression caused by\nprior passaging was partially reversed. Signaling in key immune and stroma pathways was more prominent\nand closely resembled the originator patient in HM vs. non-HM models. The immune cells mounted effective\ntumor-specific immune responses, mediated by human immune cells including T cells. Significantly, immune\nresponses upon immune therapies in the HM melanoma models showed a correlation with the patient's\ntherapy results. Two salient and under-studied issues limit the wider application of HM: The relevance of the\ndegree of tumor and immune matching, which can affect the faithfulness of immune response, and that can\nonly be appreciated by comparing mHM and aHM. A second criticism to HM is xenogenic education of human T\ncells on mouse thymic cells, resulting from the lack of a functional human thymus in such models. In this\napplication we will further address the relevance of an autologous versus mis-matched HM to test which\napproach gives rise to a more representative model of melanoma; secondly, using the same precursor cells\nfrom the patient we will reconstitute a functional thymus. The overarching goal of this proposal is to conduct a\nco-clinical trial where we will accomplish the following: 1) prospectively generate and characterize aHM and\nmHM from 20 melanoma patients, 2) test which approach yields a more representative melanoma HM model,\n3) test in HM the immune drugs (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA4] and programmed cell\ndeath protein 1 [PD-1] inhibitors) that each patient received and correlate with the clinical data, 4) identify the\nmechanisms involved in resistance to CTLA4/PD-1 inhibitors; and finally as an exploratory Aim in selected\ncases, we will 5) generate thymic epithelium from the same patient's HSCs that will result in HM with a fully\nautologous melanoma, thymus and immune system, thus enabling immune cell education in a strictly human\ncontext. This project will advance our understanding of the tumor-host interaction in melanoma and human\ncancer, by better characterizing the interplay between melanoma cells and the immune and stroma systems,\nleading to the discovery of new approaches to improve personalization of therapy and improve outcomes.

Significantly, immune\nresponses upon immune therapies in the HM melanoma models showed a correlation with the patient's\ntherapy results. Two salient and under-studied issues limit the wider application of HM: The relevance of the\ndegree of tumor and immune matching, which can affect the faithfulness of immune response, and that can\nonly be appreciated by comparing mHM and aHM. A second criticism to HM is xenogenic education of human T\ncells on mouse thymic cells, resulting from the lack of a functional human thymus in such models. In this\napplication we will further address the relevance of an autologous versus mis-matched HM to test which\napproach gives rise to a more representative model of melanoma; secondly, using the same precursor cells\nfrom the patient we will reconstitute a functional thymus. The overarching goal of this proposal is to conduct a\nco-clinical trial where we will accomplish the following: 1) prospectively generate and characterize aHM and\nmHM from 20 melanoma patients, 2) test which approach yields a more representative melanoma HM model,\n3) test in HM the immune drugs (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA4] and programmed cell\ndeath protein 1 [PD-1] inhibitors) that each patient received and correlate with the clinical data, 4) identify the\nmechanisms involved in resistance to CTLA4/PD-1 inhibitors; and finally as an exploratory Aim in selected\ncases, we will 5) generate thymic epithelium from the same patient's HSCs that will result in HM with a fully\nautologous melanoma, thymus and immune system, thus enabling immune cell education in a strictly human\ncontext. This project will advance our understanding of the tumor-host interaction in melanoma and human\ncancer, by better characterizing the interplay between melanoma cells and the immune and stroma systems,\nleading to the discovery of new approaches to improve personalization of therapy and improve outcomes.

State-\nlevel practitioners are in ideal positions to affect programs and policies related to cancer control. Mis-\nimplementation refers to ending effective programs and policies or continuing ineffective ones. Greater\nattention to mis-implementation should lead to use of effective interventions and more efficient expenditure of\nresources, which in the long term, will lead to positive cancer outcomes.\nGOAL: This proposal seeks to describe the extent of cancer control mis-implementation and to identify\nleverage points for addressing mis-implementation in the United States.\nAIMS AND METHODS: This is a three-phase study that takes a comprehensive approach, leading to the\nelucidation of tactics for addressing mis-implementation. Phase 1: The first aim seeks to assess the extent to\nwhich mis-implementation is occurring among state cancer control programs in public health. This initial phase\nwill involve a survey of 800 practitioners representing all states. The programs represented will span the full\ncontinuum of cancer control (from prevention to survivorship). Phase 2: Using data from Phase 1 to identify\norganizations in which mis-implementation is high or low, we will conduct eight comparative case studies to\nunderstand contextual differences. These case studies will highlight lessons learned about mis-implementation\nand identify hypothesized drivers. Phase 3: The 3rd aim seeks to build agent-based models to identify dynamic\ninteractions between individual, organizational, and contextual (external) factors driving mis-implementation.\nAgent-based modeling will be used to determine the most effective potential approaches for reducing mis-\nimplementation. We will translate and disseminate findings from Phases 1-3 to practitioners and practice-\nrelated stakeholders in order to support the reduction of mis-implementation. All study phases will rely on an\nAdvisory Group of public health practitioners and close collaboration with key practice partners.\nINNOVATIONS AND IMPACT: This study is innovative and impactful because it will: 1) be the first to refine\nand further develop reliable and valid measures of mis-implementation of public health programs; 2) bring\ntogether a strong, transdisciplinary team with significant expertise in practice-based research; 3) use agent-\nbased modeling to address cancer control implementation; and 4) use a participatory, evidence-based,\nstakeholder-driven approach that will identify key leverage points for addressing mis-implementation among\nstate public health programs. This research is expected to result in a replicable model that can significantly\nimpact mis-implementation in cancer control and can be applied to other health areas.

By enabling significant increases in the reconstructed\nimage signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), TOF-PET has demonstrated\nsubstantial clinical impact on the visualization and quantification of molecular signatures of cancer in\npatients. In particular it has been shown to improve image quality and accuracy in count starved and\ncontrast limited lesion detection scenarios. The effective photon sensitivity boost provided by TOF can\nalso be exploited to significantly reduce injected dose to the patient and/or study duration, factors that\nwould make PET more practical, cost-effective, and safe for a variety of clinical cancer imaging\napplications. Thus, studies that further advance the TOF-PET technique, and photon sensitivity in\ngeneral, are highly worthwhile. The key to better TOF-PET performance is to improve the annihilation\nphoton pair coincidence time resolution (CTR) measured between any two detection elements in the\nsystem, which has been a focus of research for the past two decades. Current commercially available\nPET systems achieve a CTR of roughly 350 to 800 ps full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). A goal of this\nproposal is to employ a novel scintillation detection configuration in order to achieve 100 ps FWHM CTR,\nwithout compromising other important performance parameters. This novel configuration also enables\nanother capability not possible with the conventional PET detector: The ability to measure the energy and\nthree-dimensional (3D) position of one or more annihilation photon interactions in the detector. Owing to\nthe fact that most incoming 511 keV photons undergo inter-crystal Compton scatter in the detectors, we\ncan exploit the kinematics of that process to estimate the photon angle-of-incidence. If successful, that\ncapability enables us to accurately position the first interaction of such multi-crystal events, but also offers\nthe potential to retain a high fraction of photon events that are normally rejected by a conventional PET\nsystem, such as single (unpaired) photons, random coincidences, tissue-scatter coincidences, and\nmultiple (>2) photon coincidences. Since these normally-discarded events are over 10-fold more\nprobable than true coincidence events in a standard PET study, this 3D position sensitive detector shows\npromise as another method to greatly boost photon sensitivity. If successful, this resulting substantial\nphoton sensitivity increase, along with the substantial image SNR enhancement possible with 100 ps\nCTR would enable PET to be more sensitive, accurate, and practical for cancer imaging. In this project\nwe will design and develop these next-generation detectors, integrate these modules into a prototype\npartial-ring PET system, and compare image quality and accuracy available with this partial-ring system\nto a state-of-the-art whole body TOF-PET system currently installed in our imaging clinic.

Owing to\nthe fact that most incoming 511 keV photons undergo inter-crystal Compton scatter in the detectors, we\ncan exploit the kinematics of that process to estimate the photon angle-of-incidence.

Since these normally-discarded events are over 10-fold more\nprobable than true coincidence events in a standard PET study, this 3D position sensitive detector shows\npromise as another method to greatly boost photon sensitivity.

Since CRC develops over a number of\nyears from precursor lesions called polyps, it is largely detectable and preventable in early stages.

Modeling studies have shown that for population screening,\na strategy of annual FIT testing from age of 50 to 75 years results in an equal number of life-years gained as\ncompared with colonoscopy every 10 years.

Furthermore,\nlower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality\noutcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more\neffective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and\nmortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have\ntargeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a\nstatistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web-\nenabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms\nwill be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider\ncommunication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot\ntrial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly\nreminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control\ngroup (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding\nthe intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to\ndevelop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term\neffects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample\npowered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1)\nan “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group\n(n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a\n“Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET\nadherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning\nsymptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable\nalerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long-\nterm adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures,\nincluding AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will\nprovide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the\n“Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience.

project	5R01CA218155-05	5R01CA218155-05	10242709	2021	Communication App to Manage Symptoms and Improve Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy Adherence	For women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, long-term use of adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET)\nsignificantly reduces the risk of hospitalizations, cancer recurrence and mortality, and increases quality of life.\nDespite the known benefits of AETs, many patients are nonadherent due to adverse side effects. Furthermore,\nlower adherence among black women may be contributing to the large and growing disparities in mortality\noutcomes. Real-time monitoring of treatment-related adverse symptoms and adherence could result in more\neffective management of symptoms, higher medication adherence, and ultimately lower recurrence and\nmortality. To date, however, only a few interventions have aimed to improve AET adherence, few have\ntargeted symptom management as a means to improve adherence, and of these, none have found a\nstatistically significant impact on adherence. Our proposed study will fill this research gap by testing a web-\nenabled app designed with the explicit goal of improving long-term AET adherence. Patient-reported symptoms\nwill be integrated directly with the patient's electronic health record in order to improve patient-provider\ncommunication about AET adherence and related adverse symptoms outside of clinic visits. In a small pilot\ntrial of the study app, we found that participants who had recently initiated a new AET and received weekly\nreminders to use the app reported significantly higher adherence to AETs at 8 weeks compared with a control\ngroup (91% vs. 68%, p=0.02). The proposed study builds on the success of our pilot study by: 1) expanding\nthe intervention period to six months in order to capture later-onset adverse symptoms that are slower to\ndevelop; 2) following participants for one to three years, depending on enrollment year, to test longer-term\neffects of the intervention on medication adherence and other outcomes; and 3) including a larger sample\npowered to test multiple levels of the intervention. We will randomize 300 participants to one of three arms: 1)\nan “App” group (n=100) that will receive weekly reminders to use the PCM app; 2) an “App+Feedback” group\n(n=100) that will receive weekly reminders and personalized feedback based on their use of the app; or 3) a\n“Usual Care” group (n=100) that will receive usual care only. The app will include questions about AET\nadherence and adverse symptoms with built-in alerts sent to the patient's care team if any concerning\nsymptoms or trends are reported. We hypothesize that monitoring symptoms and adherence with actionable\nalerts and tailored feedback reports to patients will result in timelier symptom management and higher long-\nterm adherence to AET. By evaluating the impact of the intervention on a comprehensive set of measures,\nincluding AET adherence, patient outcomes, racial disparities and resource use-related costs, our study will\nprovide valuable and actionable results for providers, policy makers, and insurers who strive to achieve the\n“Triple Aim” – reduce costs while improving health outcomes and the patient experience.

Project summary/abstract\nPROJECT: Mixed-Methods approach to evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of\nHPV+ women who have performed self-collection\nCervical cancer is a serious public health problem reflecting social and gender inequalities in health. It is the\nthird cause of cancer death among women in the world, with more than 85% of cases occurring in developing\ncountries. Currently, the development of new technologies based on HPV DNA detection allows HPV self-\ncollection, increasing screening coverage. In a self-collection based strategy, triage becomes a key step in the\nprevention process, as it is the first method to identify HPV+ women who will need diagnostic and treatment\nprocedures. However, high adherence to triage is difficult to obtain, which is not surprising given that\nadherence to follow-up and treatment is a generalized problem in cervical cancer programs.\nSpecific aims of the study are: 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative multi-component mHealth\nintervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests compared to usual\ncare. 2. To evaluate the implementation strategy and identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the\nmulti-component mHealth intervention.\nThe research study design will follow the structure of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial, and\nwill use mix-method approach. A cluster randomized trial including 200 CHWs (clusters) and 4000 women will\nbe used to evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention to increase adherence to\ncytology triage at 120 days after positive HPV testing. The mHealth intervention will include SMS messages\nsent to HPV+ women to inform them when results are available, and subsequent SMS messages as\nreminders. In addition, for those HPV+ women who did not had a triage cytology result within 60 days of the\nHPV test result, CHWs will receive an e-mail and SMS message so they can contact these women during\nhome visits for specific counseling and support. For the implementation evaluation, the Consolidated\nFramework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to guide qualitative data collection and analysis\nof factors that influence implementation. RE-AIM will be used to assess the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,\nImplementation and Maintenance of the Intervention.\nResults of this project will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the multi-component mHealth intervention\nto increase triage of HPV+ women, but it could be adapted to increase compliance of diagnoses/ treatment of\ncervical cancer and other health problems. Findings from the implementation evaluation will be highly\napplicable to programs that use or are planning to incorporate HPV self-collection in different settings and\ncountries. In addition, the use of CFIR and RE-AIM in this innovative study will serve as a model of work,\nconstituting an important advance in the use of Implementation Science in the Region.

project	1R01CA221290-01	1R01CA221290-01	9403804	2017	Metabolic reprogramming of Tregs in tumor immunity	Program Description/Abstract\nMetabolic reprogramming is a fundamental process underlying the growth of cancer cells and activated\nlymphocytes. These rapidly dividing cells markedly upregulate aerobic glycolysis (Warburg metabolism) and\nalso reprogram mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to support the energy and growth\ndemands. Moreover, mTOR signaling is a central regulator of anabolic metabolism in cancer cells and\nlymphocytes. While Warburg and mitochondrial metabolism and mTOR signaling are being actively studied, we\nare just beginning to appreciate the involvement of other biosynthetic programs such as de novo lipid synthesis\n(lipogenesis). Emerging evidence highlights that cancer immunotherapy is a powerful tool to combat cancers,\nbut immune tolerance mediated by immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) represents a major obstacle\nfor effective anti-tumor immunity. Although mTOR was generally considered a crucial negative regulator of\nTregs, our genetic studies have revealed that mTORC1 is a pivotal positive determinant of Treg function by\nlinking immune signals to the lipogenic program. In our preliminary studies, disruption of the lipogenic program\nin Tregs rendered the mice to reject tumor cells but did not cause obvious autoimmune disorders under steady\nstate. We hypothesize that lipogenic program contributes to Treg suppressive activity in the tumor\nmicroenvironment, which could represent a novel target for cancer immunotherapy. We will test this hypothesis\nby establishing the roles of Treg lipogenic programs in tumor immunity, and determining the metabolic and\nsignaling basis whereby lipogenesis programs Treg functions. We predict these studies will establish a new\nparadigm on our understanding of lipogenic program in Tregs and how this impinges upon tumor immunity.\nInsights gained from this project will likely lead to innovative strategies on cancer immunotherapy by\ncapitalizing on metabolic reprogramming of Tregs.

Our proposal addresses the problem of advanced, PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. We propose a\nrole for PI3K-inhibitors in this disease at a stage when the disease no longer responds to endocrine\nmanipulation, cdk4/6- or mTOR-inhibition and when patients typically receive palliative chemotherapy. These\npre-treated tumors frequently display increased glucose avidity as evidenced by high SUVmax values in 18FDG-\nPET-scans and highly active glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect. 30 - 40% of breast tumors have\nactivating PIK3CA mutations, and these co-occur with expression of estrogen receptor (ER). There are current\nclinical trial efforts aimed using modern PI3K-inhibitors (PI3Ki) GDC0032, Copanlisib or Gedatolisib to restore\nresponsiveness to ER blockade, but studies to integrate these drugs at a later stage of PIK3CA-mutant BC are\nlacking. Here we propose a role for these more modern PI3K-inhibitors at later stages of the disease,\nwhen PIK3CA-mutant tumors have developed endocrine, cdk4/6i and mTORi resistance. We have\nrecently discovered that PI3Ki work by disrupting an AKT-independent pathway that regulates glycolysis\nand sustains the Warburg effect, in addition to the disruption of canonical signaling pathways via AKT. In this\npathway PI3K triggers the mobilization and release of aldolase from the cytoskeleton, and this in turn\npotentiates aldolase activity and the Warburg effect. This basic mechanism links PI3K signaling with\ncytoskeletal dynamics and enhanced glycolytic flux. To what extent PI3Ki efficacy is determined by the\nability to inhibit aldolase and to suppress the Warburg effect in advanced cancer, is still unknown and will be\nexamined here. We propose that the activating PIK3CA mutation fuels the carbohydrate metabolism of\nPIK3CA-mutant BC, even at the stage of endocrine resistance, hat the anti-metabolic activity of PI3K-inhibitors\ncan be visualized using in vivo NMR and exploited to improve treatment outcomes in combination with anti-\nneoplastic agents. In the first aim we will introduce a mutant form of aldolase to determine the contribution of\nthe PI3K-aldolase axis to PI3Ki-efficacy in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer. In the second aim we will determine\nin vivo if the metabolic changes induced by PI3K-inhibition are predictive of cancer treatment responses. We\nwill visualize lower glycolysis directly in tumors in vivo using NMR detection of 13C[1]-pyruvate\nmetabolism and compare the predictive value of NMR with that of 18FDG-PET CT. Simultaneous studies of the\nflux of 13C-glucose and 13C[1]-pyruvate will be used to pinpoint mechanisms of resistance. In a third aim, we\nwill develop treatment combinations that may improve the outcomes for women with metastatic BC. Given the\nvulnerability of BC cells in the early post-mitotic phase, we propose to explore PI3K-inhibition following\ninfusion of taxanes or vinca alkaloids in mouse models of PIK3CA-mutant endocrine-resistant BC.

This supplemental proposal seeks to uncover the mechanism of synergy and develop an optimized\nregimen of the combination of a microtubule-disrupting agent, eribulin, and a PI3K-inhibitor in PDX models of\nbreast cancer. The work will be conducted as a national collaboration between Washington University in St.\nLouis and BIDMC/Harvard Medical School in Boston. In her pre-clinical work, Dr. Ma at Washington University\nin St. Louis has shown that the combination of eribulin and the PI3K-inhibitor copanlisib greatly extends\nprogression-free survival in eight PDX models of TNBC. This novel concept is now being carried forward into a\nclinical trial in patients with metastatic TNBC (NCT04345913). Her discovery was surprising as PI3K-inhibitor\nbenefit so far had been restricted to ER+PIK3CAmt breast cancer. The exact mechanism and, based on the\nmechanism, best timing of eribulin and PI3K-inhibitor will be determined in the proposed work.\n Our Parent Proposal is slated to develop PI3K-inhibitor (PI3Ki) combinations for patients with PIK3CA-\nmutant breast cancer. PI3Kinase is a nodal point of the intracellular signaling machinery that drives cell division\nof breast cancer cells. PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer can be targeted with alpelisib, a recent FDA-approved\nPI3K-a inhibitor now widely used in the metastatic setting in conjunction with estrogen receptor blockade. Our\nSupplemental Proposal is an extension of Aim 2, To determine in vivo if the metabolic changes induced by PI3K-\ninhibition are predictive of cancer treatment responses and of Aim 3, To determine in vivo if time-staggered PI3K-\ninhibition can enhance the efficacy of antineoplastic treatments for endocrine-resistant PIK3CA-mutant BC of\nour Parent Proposal. In this project, we hypothesize that PI3K-inhibition is a metabolic intervention that, if applied\nstrategically following microtubule disruption, can deepen and prolong remissions obtained with microtubule-\ndisrupting drugs, which are widely used to treat metastatic breast cancer. We will employ in vitro imaging and\nmetabolomic studies and in vivo imaging with 18FDG-glucose and 13C-pyruvate to deep-probe glycolysis in\nresponse to chemotherapy, PI3K-inhibition and their combination and test if these imaging modalities can predict\nresponses.\n The team at WashU (Dr. Cynthia Ma, medical oncology and preclinical mouse work, Dr. Kooresh Shogi\n(quantitative PET-imaging, Dr. Cornelius von Morze (quantitative MRI imaging) and at BIDMC/Boston (Dr.\nGerburg Wulf, pre-clinical mechanistic studies and Dr. Aaron Grant, pioneer in 13C-pyruvate imaging) have\nestablished a MTA for transfer of the PDX models and will conference bi-monthly to make this supplemental\nproject happen within a year.

project	1R01CA229164-01A1	1R01CA229164-01A1	9724606	2019	Novel Degraders of the Androgen Receptor (AR) and AR Splice Variants (AR-SVs)	Approximately 160,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) and around 30,000 died of PCa in 2017.\nOver 3.3 million men are surviving with PCa in the United States and this number is expected to increase to 4.5\nmillion by 2026. Current therapeutic strategies for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) include\nandrogen receptor (AR) antagonists and a CYP17A1 inhibitor that prevents synthesis of androgens. Although\nthese drugs extend the progression-free survival, approximately 30% of the tumors do not respond to these\ntherapies and the remaining develops resistance shortly after treatment initiation. One of the primary reasons for\nCRPC relapse, despite these treatments, is expression of constitutively-active AR splice variants (AR-SV) that\nlack the ligand binding domain (LBD). To overcome this critical barrier, we discovered novel AR antagonists\n(Selective Androgen Receptor Degraders (SARDs)) that bind to the AR-activation function-1 domain (AF-1) in\nthe N terminal domain (NTD) and/or LBD and antagonize and degrade AR and AR-SVs. The SARDs have unique\npharmacologic properties that strongly and selectively antagonize the AR and degrade full length and splice\nvariant AR (independent of LBD) in multiple models. These SARDs inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells and\ntumors that are dependent on AR full length and splice variants for growth.\nThe SARDs we have tested thus far have poor bioavailability and drug-like properties. In order to overcome the\npoor bioavailability and to understand the mechanisms of action, we propose a) to develop novel SARDs that\nwill inhibit and degrade full length and splice variants of the AR and will be orally bioavailable and b) to identify\nmechanisms by which the AR and its splice variants are degraded, resulting in drugs with better efficacy. Under\naim-1 we will synthesize AR antagonists belonging to new generation of SARDs that will degrade the AR, inhibit\nprostate cancer growth, and will be orally bioavailable. We will synthesize and identify orally bioavailable SARDs\nand evaluate those using in vitro and in vivo PCa and CRPC models. These studies will result in highly potent\nnew SARDs that will have drug-like properties.

The number of PCa survivors is expected to increase from 3.3 million men currently\nto 4.5 million by 2026. One of the primary reasons for treatment failure and castration-resistant prostate cancer\n(CRPC) relapse is expression of constitutively-active AR splice variants (AR-SVs) that lack the ligand binding\ndomain (LBD) and thus remain constitutively active. AR-SVs contribute to an aggressive phenotype of CRPC,\nshorter progression-free survival (PFS), and failure to respond to enzalutamide or abiraterone. Compared to\nCaucasian men, African American men have a 63% higher overall PCa incidence (228.8 vs 140.3 per 100,000,\nage adjusted to 2000 US population). These patients are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive/potentially\nlethal PCa, are 2.44-fold more likely to die from PCa and have shorter disease-free survival. Our central\nhypothesis is that the higher incidence of aggressive CRPC in African American men is due to the higher\nexpression and function of AR-SVs compared to their Caucasian counterparts. As our SARDs are the only\nset of molecules having the properties to degrade the AR-SVs, proving this hypothesis will help us to tailor our\ndrug development protocols towards the African American men who might have higher expression of AR-SVs.\nTo address the hypothesis that the African American men express AR-SVs at a higher level than Caucasian\nmen, we will determine the expression of AR-V7 in PCa and CRPC specimens from African American and\nCaucasian men (specific aim-1), determine race differences in AR-V7 function by quantifying AR-V7-target gene\nsignature expression in PCa tissue from African American and Caucasian PCa patients (specific aim-2), and test\nthe efficacy of SARDs in CRPC patient-derived xenograft UT-1335 that was obtained from an African American\nman (specific aim-3). The data will be a harbinger for future drug development tailored towards African American\nmen with PCa.

Our central hypotheses are that\nthe covalently-binding AR inhibitors will serve as the next-generation therapeutics and as a research\nreagent that will help us to precisely identify the binding site of our SARDs to the AR NTD. To address\nthese hypotheses, we will synthesize covalent molecules that bind strongly and with smaller dissociation\nconstant (kd) for further development for clinical use (specific aims-1 and 2) and use covalent molecules to\nprecisely identify the binding sites of the SARDs and the structure of the AF-1 (specific aim-3).

The proposed study will\ngenetically exploit lncRNA-regulated cellular networks in TNBC to identify an improved therapeutic strategy. Our\nresearch has illuminated lncRNA involvement in TNBC metastasis and metabolic reprogramming. One\nlncRNA, LINK-A, is upregulated in TNBC and is negatively correlated with breast cancer patient outcomes.\nTissue-specific expression of LINK-A in mouse mammary glands drives tumor development and lung metastasis,\nwhich shares morphological and transcriptional similarity to human TNBC. Furthermore, the expression of LINK-\nA facilities an immunosuppressive environment and profoundly impacts CD9+ T-cell infiltration via lncRNA-\nmediated antigenicity loss. Mechanistically, LINK-A concurrently activates multiple oncogenic signaling\npathways and promotes TRIM71-dependent degradation of the peptide-loading complex, leading to impaired\nantigen presentation. Therefore, LINK-A transgenic mice should serve as a powerful tool for dissecting the\nmolecular complexity of TNBC and assessing precise therapeutic formulations against TNBC. Since most\npathway inhibitors in TNBC clinical trials have been unsuccessful, a lncRNA-directed therapeutic approach, with\nthe appropriate combination of immunotherapy, may optimize the efficacy of therapies for TNBC.\nThe long-term goal of the proposal is to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated antigenicity\nloss and immunosuppression so that improved strategies can be developed to reduce TNBC morbidity and\nmortality. Our central hypothesis is that LINK-A promotes the initiation and immunoresistance of breast cancer,\nwhich can be attenuated in vivo by a combinatorial treatment approach. We will address our hypothesis from\nfollowing aspects: we will first define the underlying molecular mechanism of lncRNA-dependent antigenicity\nloss. We will then restore antigenicity by targeting lncRNA and lncRNA-related signaling events. Finally, we will\nascertain the functional importance of lncRNAs in breast cancer tumorigenesis.\nEmerging evidence of the oncogenic involvement of lncRNAs, as well as their implicated roles in mediating\nimmunosurveillance and immunosuppression, warrants further characterization of TNBC-specific lncRNAs and\nfuture applications that hinge on their activity. Our goal is to demonstrate that LINK-A, as a hallmark of TNBC,\nmay serve as a diagnostic marker that predicts a cancer’s sensitivity to immunotherapy. Thus, a strategy that\ncombines immune checkpoint blockers and lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies has the potential to significantly\nadvance TNBC treatment. In the long run, these research findings will benefit the cancer community by\nintroducing the robust clinical effects of targeting lncRNAs and a well-defined means of stratifying patients based\non these oncogenic lncRNAs.

project	5R01CA231011-03	5R01CA231011-03	10092976	2021	Development of Long non-coding RNA-directed Target Therapy for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer	Project Summary\n As a deadly disease lacking an FDA-approved targeted therapy, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)\ninvolves a complicated and entangled network of oncogenic processes in which long non-coding RNAs\n(lncRNAs), a novel class of regulatory RNA molecules, may play important roles. The proposed study will\ngenetically exploit lncRNA-regulated cellular networks in TNBC to identify an improved therapeutic strategy. Our\nresearch has illuminated lncRNA involvement in TNBC metastasis and metabolic reprogramming. One\nlncRNA, LINK-A, is upregulated in TNBC and is negatively correlated with breast cancer patient outcomes.\nTissue-specific expression of LINK-A in mouse mammary glands drives tumor development and lung metastasis,\nwhich shares morphological and transcriptional similarity to human TNBC. Furthermore, the expression of LINK-\nA facilities an immunosuppressive environment and profoundly impacts CD9+ T-cell infiltration via lncRNA-\nmediated antigenicity loss. Mechanistically, LINK-A concurrently activates multiple oncogenic signaling\npathways and promotes TRIM71-dependent degradation of the peptide-loading complex, leading to impaired\nantigen presentation. Therefore, LINK-A transgenic mice should serve as a powerful tool for dissecting the\nmolecular complexity of TNBC and assessing precise therapeutic formulations against TNBC. Since most\npathway inhibitors in TNBC clinical trials have been unsuccessful, a lncRNA-directed therapeutic approach, with\nthe appropriate combination of immunotherapy, may optimize the efficacy of therapies for TNBC.\nThe long-term goal of the proposal is to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms of lncRNA-mediated antigenicity\nloss and immunosuppression so that improved strategies can be developed to reduce TNBC morbidity and\nmortality. Our central hypothesis is that LINK-A promotes the initiation and immunoresistance of breast cancer,\nwhich can be attenuated in vivo by a combinatorial treatment approach. We will address our hypothesis from\nfollowing aspects: we will first define the underlying molecular mechanism of lncRNA-dependent antigenicity\nloss. We will then restore antigenicity by targeting lncRNA and lncRNA-related signaling events. Finally, we will\nascertain the functional importance of lncRNAs in breast cancer tumorigenesis.\nEmerging evidence of the oncogenic involvement of lncRNAs, as well as their implicated roles in mediating\nimmunosurveillance and immunosuppression, warrants further characterization of TNBC-specific lncRNAs and\nfuture applications that hinge on their activity. Our goal is to demonstrate that LINK-A, as a hallmark of TNBC,\nmay serve as a diagnostic marker that predicts a cancer’s sensitivity to immunotherapy. Thus, a strategy that\ncombines immune checkpoint blockers and lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies has the potential to significantly\nadvance TNBC treatment. In the long run, these research findings will benefit the cancer community by\nintroducing the robust clinical effects of targeting lncRNAs and a well-defined means of stratifying patients based\non these oncogenic lncRNAs.

project	3R01CA231011-03S1	3R01CA231011-03S1	10291060	2021	Long Noncoding RNA Advocates Immune Resistant Microenvironment	Project Summary\nHistorically, the majority of relevant research has only interrogated classical pathways in breast cancer cells and\nhas had little success in developing clinical drugs against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Immunotherapy,\nincluding PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, has recently been proven effective in treating a number of tumor lineages, but\nthe majority of TNBC cases are regarded as resistant or immune-quiescent tumors and are unresponsive to\nsingle checkpoint treatments. These challenges demand definition of the molecular mechanisms underlying the\nimmunosuppression that develops during TNBC progression. We demonstrated that tumor-resident Schwann\ncells (refered as TASc) play important roles in promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Tumor-\nresident Schwann cells express one lncRNA that modulates RAF1-mediated phosphorylation of TDO2\n(Tryptophan 2,3-Dioxygenase), thereby facilitating the enzymatic activities of TDO2 and catalysis of Tryptophan\n(Trp) to Kynurenine (Kyn). The released Kyn in tumor microenvironment further facilitates the expansion of\nMDSC (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) and quiescence of effector T cells. Therefore, considering tumor-\nassociated Schwann cell and lncRNAs as therapeutic targets may potentially sensitize TNBC to immunotherapy.\nThe long-term goal of the proposal is to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms and functional importance of\nlncRNAs in breast cancer so that improved strategies can be developed to reduce TNBC morbidity and mortality.\nOur central hypothesis is that PVT1 facilitates phosphorylation of TDO2 in tumor-associated Schwann cells to\npromote triple-negative breast cancer immunoresistance, which could be attenuated in vivo using a targeted\ntherapy. We will address our hypothesis from following aspects. 1) We will demonstrate the mechanisms of\ntumor-associated Schwann cell-dependent immunosuppression (Aim 1). We will determine the underlying\nmolecular mechanisms of PVT1 in regulating the enzymatic activities of TDO2 (Aim 2). 3) We will ascertain the\nfunctional importance of tumor-resident Schwann cells and PVT1 using small molecule inhibitor and small\nmolecular inhibitor-conjugated Pvt1 anti-sense oligonucleotides in combination with immunotherapy (Aim 3).\nEmerging evidence of the oncogenic involvement of lncRNAs, as well as their implicated roles in mediating\nimmunosuppression, warrants further characterization of Schwann cell-specific lncRNAs and future applications\nthat hinge on their activity. Our goal is to demonstrate that PVT1, expressed in tumor-associated Schwann cells,\nmay serve as a diagnostic marker that predicts a cancer’s sensitivity to immunotherapy. Thus, a strategy that\ncombines immune checkpoint blockers and lncRNA-based therapeutic strategies has the potential to significantly\nadvance TNBC treatment. In the long run, these research findings will benefit the cancer community by\nintroducing the robust clinical effects of targeting tumor-associated Schwann cells and Schwann cells-expressing\nlncRNAs as promising therapeutic targets.

However, HCT-related factors, such as total body irradiation used for conditioning,\ngraft-versus-host disease, and prolonged exposure to immunosuppressive therapy, result in very high risk for\nsubsequent skin cancers. Compared with the general population, HCT survivors are also more likely to develop\nskin cancers at a younger age, have advanced disease at presentation, and experience multiple recurrences.\nDespite this high burden, less than 20% of long-term HCT survivors report being examined for skin cancer, even\nthough >90% were seen by their primary care physician (PCPs) in the prior year. In HCT survivors, skin cancers\ndevelop at a time when their follow-up care has largely transitioned from oncology care to the primary care\nsetting, emphasizing the need to develop innovative strategies that 1) provide HCT survivors with the skills to\nconduct effective skin self-examinations, and prompt action from their providers when worrisome lesions are\nfound; 2) engage PCPs in HCT risk-based screening for skin cancer; and 3) ensure rapid access to dermatologic\nexams. Advances in technology, including widespread availability of cell phones and teledermoscopy (remote\nexpert assessment of a photographed lesion) offer promising opportunities to improve early detection and\ntreatment of skin cancer. We propose a comparative effectiveness study that will examine the impact of patient\nactivation and education (PAE), alone or in combination with physician-tailored strategies, on clinically\nmeaningful behavioral outcomes. We will enroll 720 HCT survivors at a large, diverse HCT center to:\n1) Determine the impact of PAE alone or with physician activation (PAE+Phys) on skin cancer screening and\nprevention practices at 12 months; and 2) Among PCPs of HCT survivors, determine the impact of a\nteledermoscopy e-learning program compared with provision of print materials for identifying suspect lesions.\nWe hypothesize that compared to PAE, patients randomized to PAE+Phys will report higher rates of thorough\nself- and provider skin exam, shorter time to referral of suspicious lesions, and improved quality of life; compared\nto print materials alone, physicians randomized to teledermoscopy e-learning will have greater recognition of\nsuspect lesions and more appropriate, cost-effective referral patterns. Our multi-disciplinary team will: 1)\nestablish the efficacy of PAE, and the relative benefit of physician activation; 2) inform the practice of skin cancer\nscreening using innovative mobile strategies that are readily applicable in the clinical setting; and 3) identify\nfacilitators of and barriers to appropriate delivery of survivorship-focused preventive care for long-term HCT\nsurvivors. Information obtained from the current study can be used to develop strategies for management of\nother late effects (e.g. cardiovascular, endocrine) in HCT survivors in the primary care setting, and to improve\nskin cancer screening in other high-risk (e.g. radiation-exposed) cancer survivor populations.

This proposal is important\nbecause by 2040, 73% of survivors will be aged 65+ and almost 50% will be aged 75+. Unfortunately, aging-\nrelated conditions (e.g., physical and cognitive function impairments) are not addressed routinely in survivorship\ncare. Preliminary research by all multiple principal investigators (MPIs: Mohile, Janelsins, Mustian) suggests that\na Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) intervention is effective for surveilling, triaging and managing\nphysical and cognitive impairments, improving patient and caregiver satisfaction, and fostering communication\nabout aging-related conditions during chemotherapy in older cancer patients and their caregivers. Preliminary\nresearch by MPIs also suggests that a Survivorship Health Promotion program is effective for improving physical\nfunction among older survivors after chemotherapy. Our MPI team has shown that GEM and Survivorship Health\nPromotion are feasible to implement in older patients, survivors and caregivers in nationwide samples recruited\nvia the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP)\nResearch Base network. To fill existing empirical gaps in survivorship care for older survivors and caregivers,\nwe created a novel intervention called Survivorship-GEM by combining these two very promising and synergistic\nprograms. Survivorship-GEM is directed by oncology advanced practice providers (APPs), because they\nroutinely direct care for survivors in the community. We propose to conduct a two-arm cluster randomized trial\ncomparing the efficacy of our novel Survivorship-GEM intervention to usual care for improving physical and\ncognitive function, satisfaction with care, completion of referral appointments, and hospitalizations among older\nsurvivors. We will also examine the effect of Survivorship-GEM on oncology APP communication with primary\ncare providers and on caregiver distress and satisfaction with care. We will randomize 30 NCORP community\noncology practices to two arms: 1) Survivorship-GEM or 2) usual care. Survivors aged 65+ (n=720) and\ncaregivers (if available, estimated n=500) will complete baseline assessments at the end of curative-intent\nchemotherapy for a solid tumor malignancy with follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Our uniquely qualified,\nmultidisciplinary team includes expertise in geriatrics, clinical trials, nursing, primary care, behavioral oncology,\nrehabilitation, health disparities, biostatistics, and implementation science. The team also benefits from\ncollaborations with the Cancer and Aging Research Group Advisory Board and the SCOREboard patient\nadvocate group.

project	1R01CA249501-01	1R01CA249501-01	9967767	2020	Self-Management to Optimize Survivorship Care and Outcomes in Lung and Colorectal Cancer	PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe overarching goal of this five-year grant proposal, submitted on behalf of the Beckman Research Institute of\nCity of Hope and the University of California, Riverside, in response to RFA-CA-19-035, is to test the efficacy\nof an advance-practice nurse (APRN)-driven telehealth Survivor Self-Management (SSM) Intervention in 414\nlung and colorectal cancer survivors. This research is critical because lung and colorectal cancer survivors\nhave high post-treatment needs, are older, and suffers from greater co-morbidities and poor quality of life\n(QOL). Lung and colorectal cancer survivors remain underrepresented in research, leading to significant\ndisparities in post-treatment outcomes. Based on the Chronic Care Self-Management Model (CCM), the SSM\nIntervention includes the following components: 1) care coordination and communication between oncology\nand primary care on surveillance/follow-up, health promotion, disease prevention, and comorbidity\nmanagement; 2) provision of clinician care plan to PCPs; 3) comprehensive patient/geriatric assessment for\nsurvivors of all ages; 4) personalized care plan for survivors; and 5) survivor self-management skills building\nfor surveillance/follow-up, late and long-term effects of treatments, comorbidities, and healthy living. It is\nadministered in five telehealth sessions (Zoom videoconferencing) and three subsequent maintenance\ntelehealth sessions for survivors who are four months post-treatment. We will test the efficacy of the SSM\nIntervention using a randomized design of attention control arm versus an intervention arm to pursue the\nfollowing specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (Primary): Determine the efficacy of the intervention on care\ncoordination, communication, and provider knowledge at 4 months post-accrual; Specific Aim 2 (Primary):\nDetermine the efficacy of the intervention on survivor outcomes at 4 months post-accrual; and Specific Aim 3\n(Exploratory): Assess the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the\nintervention. The RE-AIM Framework informs intervention delivery process, which will set the stage for future\nlarge scale implementation for sustainability in real-world care settings. This proposal is innovative because it\naddresses a critical need to improve care delivery and outcomes for high needs, understudied survivorship\npopulations (lung, colorectal, older survivors), and the telehealth approach promotes scalability. The\ninterdisciplinary team, which includes expertise in nursing science (Sun, Reb, Ferrell), oncology (Fakih), and\nprimary care (Kim) is uniquely suited to conduct this research. The proposal is significant, with high scientific\nrigor and outcomes that are of critical importance to survivors, clinicians, healthcare systems, the National\nCancer Institute, and the Beau Biden Cancer MoonshotSM. The research will address a critical gap in\nknowledge of how self-management interventions improve care delivery and outcomes during post-treatment\ntransitions to follow-up care.

Such heterogeneity becomes a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment and personalized medicine. Because of this inherent heterogeneity, data collected from cancer cell population-averaged assays likely hides valuable but rare events such as dramatic variations in gene expression at the single cell level. Therefore, understanding cellular heterogeneity from cancer biospecimens, especially in the study of phenotype-genotype correlation, will facilitate identification of new cell subsets, and assist in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. In this proposal, we focus on developing a high throughput approach for single-cell isolation based on cells' capability in generating protrusions. To be able to retrieve the desired single adherent cell, a Protrusion Analysis Chip (PAC) is proposed, in which the single cell is captured by a single hook and physically isolated by a barrier. The PAC is rapid, operationally simple, highly efficient, and requires low-volume sample introduction. After adhesion and spreading, cell phenotype is identified microscopically and then the desired cell is retrieved for genotype analysis. The proposed technology developments and study plans may potentially strengthen the understanding of the relationship between phenotype and genotype at the single cell level.

Our proposal details the development of a new methodology to simultaneously measure the expression of a large number of genes in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. Alternative approaches begin with extraction of damaged, relatively low quality RNA, which limits downstream analysis. In contrast, our system takes advantage of the crosslinked RNA molecules to obtain amplifiable signals in situ, which provides several distinct advantages related to assay sensitivity and workflow simplicity. Importantly, our system utilizes widely available instrumentation and reagents, making it immediately accessible to researchers and clinicians. We seek to achieve three overlapping goals in this project: 1. Development of a robust system to generate PCR amplifiable signals in situ using FFPE tumor sections. The success of this effort will provide the research and clinical community with a completely new method of performing gene expression analysis of FFPE specimens and fixed suspension cells. 2. Integration with high throughput DNA sequencing analysis. High throughput, or "next generation" DNA sequencing (NGS) is a powerful technology for analyzing complex mixtures of DNA sequences.

project	1R21CA215968-01	1R21CA215968-01	9305413	2017	Investigating developmental Hox programs as determinants of sarcomagenesis	PROJECT SUMMARY\nHijacking of normal developmental programs is a common mechanism of tumorigenesis and deregulation\nof developmental HOX programs, in particular, contributes to the pathogenesis of leukemia, as well as\nsome solid tumors. We recently discovered that HOX gene expression is highly deregulated in Ewing\nsarcoma, an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor that has a peak incidence in adolescence. Specifically,\nthe posterior HOX genes, HOXD10, HOXD11 and HOXD13, are over-expressed compared to other\nnormal and malignant tissues, and down-regulation of HOXD13 in Ewing sarcoma cell lines results in a\ndramatic decrease in tumorigenicity. The expression of all Hox genes normally becomes restricted to\ndistinct regions of the developing musculoskeletal (MSK) system during embryonic development, with the\nposterior genes becoming restricted to the lumbosacral vertebrae, pelvis and developing forelimb and\nhindlimb – the dominant sites of Ewing sarcoma presentation clinically. Recent work from the Wellik\nlaboratory has shown that Hox-expressing cells arise as mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells (MSCs)\nduring embryonic development and persist as regionally-restricted MSCs through postnatal and adult\nstages. MSCs have been implicated as putative cells of origin for Ewing sarcoma, but the precise identity\nof the target cells, the molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation and a clear explanation of the\nregion-specific etiology of this tumor type remain poorly understood. Important for this application, the\nLawlor lab has shown that ectopic expression of the Ewing sarcoma driver oncogene, EWS/FLI1, in bulk\npopulations of MSCs initiates tumorigenesis and disrupts HOX gene expression as a result of epigenetic\nderegulation. These two key findings lead us to the novel hypothesis that EWS/FLI1-dependent disruption\nof the posterior HOX program in MSCs where these genes are developmentally and regionally expressed\n(i.e. the posterior skeleton) is central to Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis. We will determine the efficiency\nand latency of EWS/FLI1-induced tumor formation in Hox-expressing MSCs that are isolated from different\nanatomic sites and test the hypothesis that oncogenic transformation occurs more readily in MSC\npopulations where restricted, posterior Hox gene expression has been established. We will use\nHoxa11eGFP reporter mice to monitor ectopic induction of the posterior Hox program in transduced cells\nand their resultant tumors. Use of MSCs from control and Hox mutant mouse lines will allow us to\ndetermine if posterior Hox genes are functionally required for the transformation process in vivo as our in\nvitro data suggest.

project	5R21CA215968-02	5R21CA215968-02	9527063	2018	Investigating developmental Hox programs as determinants of sarcomagenesis	PROJECT SUMMARY\nHijacking of normal developmental programs is a common mechanism of tumorigenesis and deregulation\nof developmental HOX programs, in particular, contributes to the pathogenesis of leukemia, as well as\nsome solid tumors. We recently discovered that HOX gene expression is highly deregulated in Ewing\nsarcoma, an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor that has a peak incidence in adolescence. Specifically,\nthe posterior HOX genes, HOXD10, HOXD11 and HOXD13, are over-expressed compared to other\nnormal and malignant tissues, and down-regulation of HOXD13 in Ewing sarcoma cell lines results in a\ndramatic decrease in tumorigenicity. The expression of all Hox genes normally becomes restricted to\ndistinct regions of the developing musculoskeletal (MSK) system during embryonic development, with the\nposterior genes becoming restricted to the lumbosacral vertebrae, pelvis and developing forelimb and\nhindlimb – the dominant sites of Ewing sarcoma presentation clinically. Recent work from the Wellik\nlaboratory has shown that Hox-expressing cells arise as mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells (MSCs)\nduring embryonic development and persist as regionally-restricted MSCs through postnatal and adult\nstages. MSCs have been implicated as putative cells of origin for Ewing sarcoma, but the precise identity\nof the target cells, the molecular mechanisms of malignant transformation and a clear explanation of the\nregion-specific etiology of this tumor type remain poorly understood. Important for this application, the\nLawlor lab has shown that ectopic expression of the Ewing sarcoma driver oncogene, EWS/FLI1, in bulk\npopulations of MSCs initiates tumorigenesis and disrupts HOX gene expression as a result of epigenetic\nderegulation. These two key findings lead us to the novel hypothesis that EWS/FLI1-dependent disruption\nof the posterior HOX program in MSCs where these genes are developmentally and regionally expressed\n(i.e. the posterior skeleton) is central to Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis. We will determine the efficiency\nand latency of EWS/FLI1-induced tumor formation in Hox-expressing MSCs that are isolated from different\nanatomic sites and test the hypothesis that oncogenic transformation occurs more readily in MSC\npopulations where restricted, posterior Hox gene expression has been established. We will use\nHoxa11eGFP reporter mice to monitor ectopic induction of the posterior Hox program in transduced cells\nand their resultant tumors. Use of MSCs from control and Hox mutant mouse lines will allow us to\ndetermine if posterior Hox genes are functionally required for the transformation process in vivo as our in\nvitro data suggest. With the biochemical, molecular and in vivo genetic tools the two labs have developed,\nsuccessful demonstration of this novel hypothesis during this funding period will provide the basis for\nfuture highly impactful and mechanistic dissection of the etiology of Ewing's sarcoma, including a\nmolecular basis for understanding the regional specificity of this tumor in vivo.

A patient-friendly early detection and prognosis method that detects cancer at an early stage, assesses response to treatment, and predicts risk of cancer recurrence would substantially reduce the mortality in this serious disease. Non-invasive 'liquid biopsy' relying on the detection of extracellular circulating RNAs (microRNAs and mRNAs) in patient blood samples has great potential to achieve this goal. Such biomarkers in serum/plasma can be sensitively quantified by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR of RNA isolated from the samples. However, this RNA isolation-qRT-PCR workflow cannot distinguish circulating RNAs secreted by cancer cells from those released physiologically and ubiquitously by all other, non-tumor cells of the body, making it potentially less sensitive or incapable of detecting cancer-specific RNA biomarkers. We recently developed a novel and simple tethered cationic lipoplex nanoparticle (tCLN) biochip with pre-loaded molecular beacons in the nanoparticles as probes to capture and detect cancer-specific RNAs in human serum without requiring pre- or post-sample processing. In this technology, negatively charged RNA molecules are easily captured by and fused with positively charged lipoplex nanoparticles, allowing their detection by the molecular beacons. Since both RNA targets and molecular beacons are confined within nanometer-sized liposome particles in a detection volume that is 1012 times smaller than that of a PCR reaction, this method not only provides very high detection sensitivity but also forfends the need for target amplification that qRT-PCR requires. We have demonstrated the feasibility of the tCLN biochip in detecting and quantifying extracellular miR-21 and let-7g microRNAs and Thyroid Transcription Factor-1 (TTF-1) mRNA in serum of lung cancer patients. The tCLN biochip could thus successfully distinguish early stage lung cancer patients from normal healthy controls, whereas the serum RNA isolation-qRT-PCR workflow was found to be completely ineffective for the task. We have assembled a strong multi-disciplinary team to further develop the tCLN biochip and to validate its feasibility using serum samples from smokers at high risk for developing lung cancer and from lung cancer patients. Our primary objectives are (1) to optimize the current tCLN biochip technology and to develop a microfluidic CLN (mCLN) biochip as a point-of-care diagnostic device; (2) to evaluate the performance of tCLN and mCLN biochips as a diagnostic tool for identifying lung cancer among individuals with computed tomography (CT)-detected solitary pulmonary nodules; and, (3) to evaluate the performance of tCLN and mCLN biochips as a prognostic tool using serum samples collected from early stage lung cancer patients before and at various time-points following surgical resection of cancer. We will also compare the tCLN and mCLN biochips with the traditional serum RNA isolation-qRT-PCR workflow for serum RNA detection sensitivity and specificity.

project	5R33CA192980-03	5R33CA192980-03	9269176	2017	Advanced development and validation of targeted molecular counting methods for precise and ultrasensitive quantitation of low prevalence somatic mutations	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultrasensitive detection of clinically relevant somatic alterations in cancer genomes has great potential for impacting patient care, e.g. for early detection, establishing diagnoses, refining prognoses, guiding treatment, and monitoring recurrence. However, current technologies are poorly suited to the robust detection of somatic mutations present at very low frequencies (<1%). Massively parallel sequencing represents an advantageous path forward, but its sensitivity to detect very rare events is fundamentally constrained by the sequencing error rate. We have recently developed a new experimental paradigm that overcomes this limitation. In our approach, each copy of a target sequence that is present in a sample is molecularly tagged during the first cycle of a multiplex capture reaction with a unique random sequence. After amplification, target amplicons and their corresponding molecular tags are subjected to massively parallel sequencing. During analysis, the molecular tags are used to associate sequence reads sharing a common origin. Through oversampling, reads bearing the same molecular tag error-correct one another to yield an independent haploid consensus for each progenitor molecule. Furthermore, the collapsing of commonly derived reads inherently corrects for any allele-specific bias during amplification, such that estimates of\nmutant allele frequency can be accompanied by precise confidence bounds ("molecular counting"). Among other benefits, the approach is sensitive to at least 1 mutated sequence in a background of 10,000 unmutated copies. Here we propose the advanced development and validation of this approach for use as a clinical diagnostic. In our first aim, we will develop a multiplexed panel to broadly target common cancer associated mutations using this technology. In our second aim, we will apply the panel to the detection of minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia as a prognostic marker of disease relapse. In our third aim, we will apply the panel to detection of ultra-rare mutations in circulating cell-free DNA, which is released into circulation from dying tumor cells, as a robust and non-invasive cancer diagnostic. The panel will be rigorously validated for clinical use in both aims, with performance metrics appropriately designed for the two separate analytes. The availability of robust, cost-effective, quantitative, and generically applicable tools for the ultrasensitive, multiplex detection of rare somatic events\nin the clinical setting will provide enhanced, transformative capabilities in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancers.

project	3R33CA192980-03S1	3R33CA192980-03S1	9515203	2017	Advanced development and validation of targeted molecular counting methods for precise and ultrasensitive quantitation of low prevalence somatic mutations	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultrasensitive detection of clinically relevant somatic alterations in cancer genomes has great potential for impacting patient care, e.g. for early detection, establishing diagnoses, refining prognoses, guiding treatment, and monitoring recurrence. However, current technologies are poorly suited to the robust detection of somatic mutations present at very low frequencies (<1%). Massively parallel sequencing represents an advantageous path forward, but its sensitivity to detect very rare events is fundamentally constrained by the sequencing error rate. We have recently developed a new experimental paradigm that overcomes this limitation. In our approach, each copy of a target sequence that is present in a sample is molecularly tagged during the first cycle of a multiplex capture reaction with a unique random sequence. After amplification, target amplicons and their corresponding molecular tags are subjected to massively parallel sequencing. During analysis, the molecular tags are used to associate sequence reads sharing a common origin. Through oversampling, reads bearing the same molecular tag error-correct one another to yield an independent haploid consensus for each progenitor molecule. Furthermore, the collapsing of commonly derived reads inherently corrects for any allele-specific bias during amplification, such that estimates of\nmutant allele frequency can be accompanied by precise confidence bounds ("molecular counting"). Among other benefits, the approach is sensitive to at least 1 mutated sequence in a background of 10,000 unmutated copies. Here we propose the advanced development and validation of this approach for use as a clinical diagnostic. In our first aim, we will develop a multiplexed panel to broadly target common cancer associated mutations using this technology. In our second aim, we will apply the panel to the detection of minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia as a prognostic marker of disease relapse. In our third aim, we will apply the panel to detection of ultra-rare mutations in circulating cell-free DNA, which is released into circulation from dying tumor cells, as a robust and non-invasive cancer diagnostic. The panel will be rigorously validated for clinical use in both aims, with performance metrics appropriately designed for the two separate analytes. The availability of robust, cost-effective, quantitative, and generically applicable tools for the ultrasensitive, multiplex detection of rare somatic events\nin the clinical setting will provide enhanced, transformative capabilities in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancers. The methodology will also have application to basic science cancer research.

Making sure that the submitted material actually contains tumor, in sufficient\nquantity, is not always easy, and sometimes just preparing conventional microscope slides can consume most\nor even the entire specimen. We have developed a new, simple and inexpensive approach we term MUSE, for\nMicroscopy with UV Surface Excitation, that can provide high-resolution images directly and quickly from fresh\ntissue without consuming it, and thus can preserve intact, high-quality specimens for biobanking, downstream\nmolecular and functional analyses.\n MUSE, by ensuring that acquired small biopsy specimens are indeed fit for purpose, can avoid the\nneed to have a patient return at a later date for additional biopsies. In addition, the method will allow for lesion\ndetection over larger cross-sections of tissue, such as organ whole-mounts, not currently practical with\nconventional instrumentation. Finally, we expect that MUSE will yield additional biologically informative imaging\nby avoiding artifacts inherent in conventional tissue processing and sectioning. We focus here on facilitation of\ntissue-based molecular studies, viable tumor harvest for xenografts and cultured spheroids, and biobanking,\nand include crucial validation studies to ensure that the MUSE process does not compromise sample utility due\nto possible impacts from exposure to intercalating dyes and/or UV light.\n MUSE relies on two mechanisms: 1) surface-restricted excitation of fluorescent dyes due to micron-\nscale penetration of sub-300-nm ultraviolet light; and 2) the fact that many conventional dyes excited in this\nway emit visible light. These signals are bright enough to be detected by conventional color cameras using\nsub-second exposure times, allowing rapid imaging of large areas.\n MUSE eliminates any requirement for conventional histology processing with formalin fixation, paraffin\nembedding, or thin-sectioning. It requires no lasers, confocal, multiphoton or optical coherence tomography\ninstrumentation, can eventually cost in the range of a few thousands of dollars, and therefore affordable at the\npoint of care (point of biopsy). MUSE samples are stained within seconds using familiar histology stains, such\nas eosin and DAPI, and the resulting high-resolution images converted from fluorescence to H&E-like\nbrightfield appearance for interpretation in real time (but with novel and potentially useful features) easily\ninterpreted by pathologists.\n While rapid cellular-scale imaging of fresh tissue can have significant benefits in clinical arenas, it can\nalso empower basic and translational research use for essentially instant histology-, pathology- or\ntoxicology-relevant images directly from experimental animal models—at the bench—and may help relieve\nsuch investigators from having to rely on often overworked, sometimes unavailable, conventional histology and\npathology services.

project	5R33CA206949-02	5R33CA206949-02	9321964	2017	Advanced Development and Validation of 3 Dimensional Spheroid Culture of Primary Cancer Cells using Nano3D Technology	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:\nTwo-dimensional (2D) tissue culture models are highly simplified cancer models unable to capture the\ncomplexity and heterogeneity found in-vivo. Around 95% of new anticancer drugs eventually fail in clinical trial\ndespite robust indications of activity in existing in vitro pre-clinical models, making in vitro testing some of the\nleast predictive. Three dimensional (3D) spheroid culture models have recently advanced to bridge the “in-\nvitro to in-vivo gap” and provide the means for assembling more complex cancer relevant tissue\nmicroenvironments. Although these 3D models are being adopted by industry and the academic community,\nthey have limitations and are hampered by low throughput, lack of consistency, high costs and the need for\nclinical validation. The Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center (SRIMSC) in partnership with\nn3D Biosciences Inc., Greiner Bio-One USA Inc., Dr. Derek Duckett at Scripps Research department of\nMolecular Therapeutics and Dr. David Tuveson, M.D, Ph.D. at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), have\ncreated a strategic collaboration to advance a novel technology known as 3D magnetic bioprinting. Magnetic\n3D bioprinting addresses the these critical issues by utilizing n3D's core technology known as the NanoShuttle\nto levitate and aggregate cells using magnetic forces to produce spheroids/organoids. The ultimate end\nproduct will be an affordable; HTS validated 384 and 1536 microplate format that supports rapid/consistent\nproduction of 3D spheroids for a wide array of cell types including primary tumor lines. The end goal is to\naccelerate 3D spheroid cultivation using screening automation, improve cost efficiency and allow for rapid drug\ntesting such as FDA approved drugs in reformulation/repurposing studies. Advancement of this technology will\nbe facilitated through the following: Aim 1: Validation of the current 384 well plate nanosphere technology in a\nHTS facility for automation compatibility. Compare 3D results to 2D models of KRAS pancreatic cancer cell\nmodels as provided by Dr. Tuveson. Aim 2: Validation of n3D spheroid technology for drug testing against\nselect cytotoxic drugs, NCI approved oncology drug set and the Scripps FDA Approved drug collection. CC50\ndata, i.e. the concentration that produces 50% cellular cytotoxicity, in 2D and in 3D formats will be compared to\npublished literature. Aim 3: n3D Biosciences will produce an advance 1536 well plate NanoShuttle driver\ncompatible for HTS and drug discovery efforts. SRIMSC will evaluate and implement the higher density format\nfor drug discovery utility which will culminate in its testing on a large library of ~150K compounds to\ndemonstrate HTS readiness. Aim 4: The n3D spheroid technology will be employed against patient derived\nprimary Glioblastoma Multiform (GBM) derived cells with the end goal of evaluating its utility in primary cancer\ncell research. Aim 5: The n3D spheroid technology will be evaluated in-vivo for pancreatic orthotopic tumor\neffect and its utility in preclinical research. The end goal is to transfer and implement this technology and\nmethods worldwide for cancer research and early drug discovery.	3-Dimensional;Address;Adopted;Advanced Development;Animal Model;Antineoplastic Agents;Automation;Basic Cancer Research;Biological Assay;Biological Sciences;Biomedical Research;Biopsy;Cancer Biology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Line;Cell Proliferation;Cell model;Cell-Mediated Cytolysis;Cells;Cellular Spheroids;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Collection;Communities;Complex;Cytotoxic agent;Data;Detection;Dimensions;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Drops;Environment;Equipment;FDA approved;Force of Gravity;Geometry;Glioblastoma;Goals;Gold;Growth;Heterogeneity;Human;Image;In Vitro;Industry;KRAS2 gene;Laboratories;Libraries;Literature;Magnetism;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Medicine;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Nanosphere;Organoids;Pancreas;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Drug Evaluation;Primary Neoplasm;Procedures;Production;Publishing;Readiness;Reporting;Reproducibility;Research;Research Institute;Speed;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Translations;Transplantation;Tumor-Derived;Validation;Xenograft procedure;anticancer research;base;bioprinting;cancer cell;cell assembly;cell type;cost;cost effective;cost effectiveness;culture plates;density;drug discovery;drug testing;experimental study;high throughput screening;high throughput technology;improved;in vitro Model;in vitro testing;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;iron oxide;miniaturize;monolayer;mutant;nanoparticle;neoplastic cell;new technology;novel;novel anticancer drug;oncology;pancreatic cancer cells;personalized medicine;pre-clinical;pre-clinical research;precision medicine;scaffold;screening;small molecule;statistics;success;tissue culture;tumor;two-dimensional	SCRIPPS FLORIDA	JUPITER	FL	UNITED STATES	Timothy Patrick Spicer	Nastaran  Zahir	475865	475865	2017-07-19T04:00:00Z	2016-08-01T04:00:00Z	2019-07-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-15-003

Despite the introduction of a number of novel treatments MM\npatients still are confronted with an average survival time of 5-7 years. Emerging evidence suggests\nthat the endosteal niche at the bone-BM interface fosters the survival of drug-resistant MM cells,\nespecially through adhesive interactions with osteoblasts, and is therefore responsible for relapse.\nCurrently, treatment options for MM patients are evaluated mainly on the basis of clinical features and\nhistorical population response rates. Therefore, an important unmet clinical need is to develop the\nability to select the best therapy for an individual based on the ex vivo response of the patient's MM\ncells (PMMCs) to drug treatment options. This precision medicine approach is expected to provide a\ntransformative means of: (1) reducing ineffective therapies, (2) minimizing excess toxicity and cost,\n(3) inhibiting the development of the tumor cells' cross-resistance to additional drugs as a critical part\nof the long-term care of MM patients, and (4) assessing the probability of relapse occurrence. A\nmajor challenge, however, is the lack of clinically relevant, high-throughput and inexpensive models\nthat preserve primary patient biospecimen for downstream analyses and use. The goal of this R33\nproject is to improve and validate a multiple myeloma (MM) culture platform, which was developed\nthrough the prior R21 award to enable the ex vivo preservation of PMMCs derived from BM\nbiospecimens. The specific aims of the project are to: (1) increase the culture platform's high-\nthroughput operation capability by implementing a gravity-driven, pumpless flow control strategy while\npreserving the feasibility of producing the device using industry standard materials and manufacturing\npractice and (2) prospectively correlate the ex vivo chemosensitivity and resistance of PMMCs with\nclinical response as a means of validating the predictive capability of our ex vivo MM culture platform\nand expand drug-resistant PMMCs for downstream characterization as a potential means of guiding\nsubsequent treatment selection. Anticipated results will validate that ex vivo preserved MM\nbiospecimens can be widely used with our culture platform for screening patient-specific treatment\noptions as well as for other applications such as preclinical evaluation of new therapeutics, studying\ndrug-resistant PMMC populations, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and ex vivo models of breast\nand prostate cancers that metastasize to BM and bone.

Unfortunately, there are\nsubstantial gaps in existing capabilities in terms of sensitivity. For example, a minimum of many thousands of\ncells is required for in-depth profiling of proteins in a biological sample. We have recently developed a\nbreakthrough technology, termed nanoPOTS (Nanodroplet Preparation in One pot for Trace Samples) which,\nwhen coupled to ultrasensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), enables effective analysis of\nas few as 10 mammalian cells with a coverage of >3000 identified proteins. We hypothesize that the nanoPOTS\nplatform will be an enabling technology to characterize the molecular underpinnings of tumor heterogeneity by\ncreating 3D proteome maps of human tumors. The overall objective of our study is to extend and validate this\nanalysis platform to enable single-cell resolution measurements at high throughput (>100 samples per day) and\napply the platform to create 3D proteome maps of human tumors. Studies in Aim 1 will focus on optimizing and\nvalidating the ultrasensitive nanoPOTS proteomic workflow to enable robust proteome profiling of ≥3,000 protein\ngroups from single human cells obtained by both flow cytometry and laser capture microdissection (LCM). Aim\n2 will evaluate and compare two complementary technologies for increasing measurement throughput to ~100\ncells/day with minimal impact on proteome coverage. We will determine whether multiplexing through application\nof isobaric labels for pooled analysis, or rapid LC coupled with ultrahigh resolution ion mobility spectrometry-MS\nprovides greatest coverage, quantitation and reproducibility for single cell proteomics at the desired throughput.\nIn Aim 3, we will apply the optimized platform to create in-depth proteome maps for human pancreatic ductal\nadenocarcinomas (PDAs) at single cell resolution. Following initial targeted studies of specific cells of interest\nwithin sectioned tissues, we will use a combination of cryosectioning, LCM and the optimized nanoPOTS\nplatform to analyze single cells within the tumor microenvironment. 3D reconstruction of these in-depth, spatially\nresolved proteomic analyses will provide the first global proteomic tumor maps at single-cell resolution. This\nproject will not only establish an innovative measurement capability that will broadly advance cancer research,\nbut will also provide unique molecular insights into cellular heterogeneity relevant to PDA pathology. The\nresulting platform will be disseminated through a combination of publication and commercialization.

It is now clear that in order to develop effective therapies and predict patient\nresponse we need to better understand these interactions. Biomimetic tissue-engineered\ntechnologies and models hold the promise of incorporating more components into in vitro/ex\nvivo models and, thus, make them more accurately reflect human disease. Here we focus on\nkidney cancer and specifically, on the interactions between cancer cells and the vasculature (i.e.\nendothelial cells) - an interaction that is understudied, yet critical to better understanding,\napplying anti-angiogenic drugs and developing new such therapies. Our proposal describes an\nintegrated approach that increases relevance by enabling physiologically relevant models that\nreplicate structure/function relationships while providing patient specificity. Our approach is\ntransdisciplinary including expertise in oncology (Christos Kyriakopoulos), surgery (Jason Abel),\npathology (Wei Huang), clinical imaging (Steve Cho), biostatistics/clinical analysis (Kyungmann\nKim) and microtechnology/organotypic models (David Beebe). Specifically, we will develop a\nrobust microvessel culture approach (uVESSEL) to create an in vitro/ex vivo model of kidney\ncancer-vascular interactions using the patient's own cells to measure therapy response of\npatient specific uVESSEL model (Aim 1), measure patient response via multiple endpoints (incl.\nPSMA-based PET/CT imaging) (Aim 2), and evaluate predictive value of patient specific\nuVESSEL model (Aim 3). Our approach is bench to bedside and back again taking advantage\nof our teams' location with the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center and access to\npatient samples. Our goal is to push the boundaries between in vitro models and ex vivo\nexperiments by putting the patient's cells into biomimetic models.

Recent clinical and experimental studies addressing this problem require the\narduous collection of pre- and post- treatment data for every new specific treatment and cancer type studied.\nThus, a computational approach that can expedite the identification of molecular determinants of resistance\nvia the analysis of existing large-scale cancer cohorts is called for.\n Our proposal seeks to identify novel ways to counter de novo and acquired resistance through drug\ncombinations. We focus on gene interactions rather than individual genes and leverage large scale genomic\ndatasets and patient response data. Our approach is based on recent work in the Ruppin and other labs\nshowing that genetic interactions can be computationally identified by analyzing omics tumor data.\n To decipher pathways of resistance to cancer therapies, we focus here on studying a new type of genetic\ninteractions, termed synthetic rescues (SRs). SRs denote a functional interaction between two genes whereby a\nfitness reducing change in the activity of one of the two genes (termed the vulnerable gene) is compensated by\naltered activity of another gene (termed the rescuer gene), which restores cell fitness and rescues it. We have\nrecently developed tools for SR data-driven identification from large cancer tumors cohorts, successfully\nenabling the prediction of drug response and emergence of resistance in patients. Building on these\ntransformational results the specific aims of this proposal are:\nSpecific Aim 1. Perform a pan-cancer and cancer type-specific SR-based analyses, focusing on\nmelanoma, breast, head and neck, and colon cancer, identifying the major rescuer genes in each\ncancer type, together with specific recommendations of combinatorial therapies mitigating resistance.\nSpecific Aim 2.

project	1R33CA225296-01	1R33CA225296-01	9482979	2017	Advanced Cancer Classification via Single-Cell Electrophoretic Cytopathology	ABSTRACT\nRecent efforts to identify and circumvent mechanisms of drug resistance point to the role of HER2 truncated\nisoforms, which lack the extracellular domain of the full-length protein targeted by trastuzumab. Understanding\nthe biology of HER2 isoforms is crucial to developing new drugs personalized for individuals resistant to\ntrastuzumab therapy. However, detection of these isoforms in paraffin-embedded tissue sections (FFPE) is\nimpossible by conventional methods (Immunohistochemistry, IHC) due to the lack of isoform-specific antibodies\nand the loss of epitope integrity during tissue processing. To overcome these barriers, the goal of this project\nis to develop a robust tool that will both allow retrospective studies on HER2 isoforms and enable\nisoform screening on a patient-to-patient basis to tailor breast cancer treatment.\nOur efforts fill a major gap in cancer research: the limited ability to scrutinize tissue sections for protein targets\nthat either lack highly specific antibody probes (analytical) or lose epitope integrity during tissue processing (pre-\nanalytical). We introduce a whole-tissue western blot (wtWestern) that creates a novel 3D protein ‘imprint’\nof the tissue section for stable storage and downstream antibody probing. The unique dual-functionality\nwtWestern electrophoretically resolves proteins (extracted from a 2D tissue section) along the depth (z-axis) of\na supporting photoactive hydrogel layer. Exposure to UV light covalently links protein to the hydrogel. We\nbenchmark the fixative-free imprint for biobanking suitability, apply the wtWestern to measurement of proteins\n(including isoforms) in archived frozen or FFPE tissue sections, and maximize tissue utility by enabling detection\nof 20+ proteins for cancer sub-type classification. This innovative wtWestern is expected to maximize the quality\nand utility of biospecimens for downstream analyses – critically important to retrospective studies that form the\nbasis for both cancer diagnostics/prognostics and personalized medicine.\n	Advanced Malignant Neoplasm;Antibodies;Antineoplastic Agents;Archives;Benchmarking;Binding;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;Biometry;Blood Vessels;Breast;Breast Cancer Treatment;Cancer Diagnostics;Cell Communication;Cells;Cellular Morphology;Classification;Classification Scheme;Clinical;Complex;Cytometry;Cytopathology;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnostic;Drug resistance;ERBB2 gene;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epitopes;Exposure to;Extracellular Domain;Extracellular Matrix;Fixatives;Formalin;Freezing;Goals;Heterogeneity;Histology;Human;Hydrogels;Image;Immune;Immunohistochemistry;Individual;Laboratories;Length;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Mesenchymal;Methods;Microfluidics;Molecular;Morphology;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncoproteins;Paraffin Embedding;Pathology;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical shape;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Precision therapeutics;Progression-Free Survivals;Protein Isoforms;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Proteins;Resistance;Resolution;Retrospective Studies;Role;Selection for Treatments;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Slice;Statistical Methods;Stromal Cells;Taxonomy;Technology;Temperature;Tissue Embedding;Tissue Sample;Tissues;Trastuzumab;Ultraviolet Rays;Variant;Western Blotting;Woman;anticancer research;base;biobank;cancer classification;cancer subtypes;cancer therapy;clinical Diagnosis;commercialization;design;extracellular;humanized monoclonal antibodies;imprint;improved;innovation;insight;link protein;malignant breast neoplasm;mortality;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;personalized medicine;prognostic;protein biomarkers;protein profiling;resistance mechanism;screening;targeted cancer therapy;therapy development;tissue processing;tool;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY	BERKELEY	CA	UNITED STATES	Amy Elizabeth Herr	Tawnya C Mckee	1453938	1453938	2017-09-25T04:00:00Z	2017-09-30T04:00:00Z	2022-05-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-17-023

Tissue diagnostics for precision oncology increasingly rely on multi-valent assays to characterize\ncancer biology and identify therapeutic targets. The power of molecular imaging for cancer diagnosis has been\nwell demonstrated by [18F]fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT), widely used in\nclinical oncology. PET tracers targeted to facets of tumor biology now enable multi-valent molecular imaging to\nidentify therapeutic targets. Early studies show that combined tracer studies, commonly FDG plus a target-\nspecific tracer, are highly predictive of tumor response to targeted therapy. However, emissions from different\nPET tracers are indistinguishable to a PET scanner, requiring separate imaging sessions on separate days for\nmultiple 18F-based tracers (~ 2 hour half-life) in the same patient. This limits the clinical practicality of multi-tracer\nPET, and fails to exploit the full power of multi-tracer PET to quantify tumor in vivo biology and biologic\nheterogeneity for highly variable process such as cancer metabolism. We will overcome this limitation by taking\nadvantage of recent developments in volumetric PET scanners, fast reconstruction, and 4D image analysis\nmethods from our laboratories to develop Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate multi-valent,\nquantitative biologic parametric images for two or more tracers in a single session to guide precision oncology\nand translational cancer biology research. As such, our proposed technology development project addresses a\nneed, described under Priority Area B for “new capabilities for advancing precise clinical diagnosis of cancer\npatients”. Using methods developed in our laboratories, we now propose to integrate and enhance these\nmethodologies to develop and validate Multi-Tracer Volumetric PET (MTV-PET) to generate quantitative biologic\nparametric images for two or more tracers in a single session. We will develop and test this approach for\nsimultaneous glucose and glutamine metabolism imaging, with the goal of guiding metabolism-targeted therapy\nsuch as inhibitors of glutaminase (GLS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The project will focus on the\ntechnology developments (largely computational) that enable multi-tracer imaging. Ongoing and separately\nfunded work on clinical studies will acquire data from two separate imaging PET sessions using current\ntechnology and will provide data for method development. We will first optimize tracer dose timing, image\nreconstruction, and image time binning for dual tracer MTV-PET (Aim 1), followed by implementation and\ntechnical validation of image analysis using a mixture analysis approach (Aim 2). This will set the stage for\ntechnical validation of MTV-PET (Aim 3) and an exploratory aim (Aim 4) testing image analytics based on\nmachine learning. Successful completion of our technology development will yield a new method for multi-tracer\nPET that would change the landscape for cancer imaging diagnostic biomarker and precision oncology research,\nconsistent with goals of RFA-CA-17-023 Priority Area B.	4D Imaging;Address;Agreement;Algorithms;Area;Biological Assay;Biology;Breast Cancer Patient;Cancer Biology;Cancer Diagnostics;Cancer Patient;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Cluster Analysis;Consumption;Data;Data Set;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Dose;Emerging Technologies;Funding;Glucose;Glutaminase;Glutamine;Glycolysis;Goals;Half-Life;Heterogeneity;Hour;Human;Image;Image Analysis;Injection of therapeutic agent;Kinetics;Laboratories;Lactate Dehydrogenase;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic;Metabolism;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Outcome;Patients;Phenotype;Positron-Emission Tomography;Process;Radiation exposure;Reference Standards;Research;Technology;Testing;Three-Dimensional Image;Time;Tissues;Tracer;Tumor Biology;Validation;Work;analytical method;anticancer research;base;cancer diagnosis;cancer imaging;clinical Diagnosis;cohort;diagnostic biomarker;genomic biomarker;glucose metabolism;high dimensionality;image reconstruction;imaging biomarker;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant breast neoplasm;metabolic rate;method development;molecular imaging;novel;parametric imaging;personalized diagnostics;phenotypic biomarker;precision oncology;radiotracer;reconstruction;response;targeted treatment;technology development;therapeutic target;tumor;tumor heterogeneity;tumor metabolism;whole body imaging	UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	JOEL S KARP,DAVID A.

Colonoscopy as primary screening has been accompanied by\na modest but steady decline in CRC incidence through identification and removal of precursor lesions, the\nadenomatous polyp. Indeed, there has been a 32% decline between years 2000-2013 in CRC incidence in\npatients over age 50 (thus eligible for screening). Strikingly, during this same time period, the incidence rate for\nthose under 50 has increased by 22%. Thus, new and effective screening strategies are urgently needed to\naddress the rising burden of CRC (≤50 years) which is expected to increase over the next decade with the rising\nyoung population. The objective of the R33 Moonshot Project is to develop a highly advanced screening\napproach to identify the subset of young patients who actually harbor advanced adenomas and could benefit\nfrom colonoscopy via a test that is sensitive to advanced adenomas, low-cost, and that can be carried out in a\nprimary care setting. To this end, we have developed a new technology, partial wave spectroscopic (PWS)\nmicroscopy or nanocytology. Nanocytology performed on colonocytes swabbed from the rectal mucosa is able\nto identify nanoscale alterations in higher order chromatin structure, which are highly accurate markers of the\npresence of advanced adenomas that might be located anywhere in the colon. The goal for the proposed\nproject is to finalize the PWS technology, turn it into a practical, accurate, and low-cost test that is viable\nfor young population screening, and conduct a pre-definitive clinical trial. We aim to achieve sensitivity\nand specificity over 90%. Upon the completion of this moonshot project, nanocytology will be ready for a\ndefinitive clinical trial, which can lead to CLIA approval and launch in clinical practice as a laboratory-developed\ntest (LDT).

Recently, significant progress has been made in both understanding the genetic\nfoundation of these tumors as well as how to harness the power of the immune system to target these most\ndevastating tumors. While there has been substantial evidence in support of using T cells to treat established\ntumors in mice and humans, the translational value of these treatments has been limited by the simplicity of\nglioma models used for their development: mostly relying on transplanted tumors that do not recapitulate the\nimmune microenvironment present in human gliomas. To this end, this proposal seeks to develop a\nspontaneous and genetically faithful mouse glioma model by combining the initial IDH1R132H driver mutation\nwith other most common mutations. These models will maintain the integrity of the immune microenvironment\nof the brain and best recapitulating human glioma. With these models, we will also assess the interplay\nbetween glioma development and the immune response as dictated by different genetic mutations.\n Our second aim is to identify IDH1R132H reactive T cell antigen receptors (TCRs). We aim to improve the\ncurrent technology which employs single cell RNAseq to clone both the TCRα and TCRβ chains. We will\noptimize the current cloning procedures to dramatically reduce the reagent expense and labor cost, which is\nessential for its clinical application. This aim will be extended into a translational direction, aim 3, through\ngenetic engineering of T cells to redirect their antigen specificity against IDH1R132H. This aim is essentially a\nproof-of-principle study for TCR-T adoptive transfer immunotherapy in our immune-competent mouse glioma\nmodels.\n Combined, novel animal models and technologies developed in this study will help elucidate the complexities\nunderlying glioma genetics and how these commonly mutated genes contribute to glioma development,\nprogression, and glioma-specific immune suppression mechanisms. In addition, this will also facilitate the\ndevelopment and implementation a novel strategy for glioma immunotherapy.

Rationale: Historically, increases in tumor size or enhancement\nhave signified tumor progression, and decreases in tumor size have signified treatment response. With the\nadvent of novel chemotherapy agents, including immunotherapy, simple changes in size or enhancement are\nno longer sufficient to make treatment decisions. We believe that improved DCE-MRI methods can provide\nnew and powerful biomarkers to image brain tumors and detect early response to therapy. This will enhance\nour ability to prolong survival in a higher proportion of brain tumor patients traditionally regarded as the most\ndire prognostic group (including recurrent high-grade glioma and metastatic melanoma), who are often left out\nof clinical trials due to very short life expectancy. Innovation: We propose Specially Tailored Acquisition and\nReconstruction (STAR) DCE-MRI, in which acquisition and reconstruction are tailored from an estimation-\ntheoretic point of view to create the most accurate and reproducible tracer kinetic (TK) parameter maps, unlike\nconventional approaches that optimize the quality of intermediate images. We will fully integrate TK models\nwith DCE-MRI acquisition and reconstruction. Our preliminary data shows 36-fold improvement in spatial\nresolution and coverage compared to current techniques, with no loss of image quality in brain tumor patients;\nand we expect to only get better. Compared to current state-of-the-art DCE-MRI, this technique will provide\nthree major advances: 1- exquisite (sub-1 mm isotropic) spatial resolution to quantitatively assess narrow\ntumor margins and small lesions, 2- whole-brain coverage including all lesions and all surrounding tissue\nthereby simplifying the exam, 3- robust measurement of patient specific arterial inputs which are required for\naccurate contrast agent kinetic modeling. Approach: We will optimize, technically validate, and clinically\nevaluate STAR DCE-MRI method that provides improved quantitative parametric brain maps including blood-\nbrain barrier leakage and fractional plasma volume. Specifically, we will: 1- optimize and technically validate\nSTAR DCE-MRI to produce accurate and reproducible TK parameter maps, 2- produce a robust clinical\nimplementation of STAR DCE-MRI, and 3- clinically evaluate STAR DCE-MRI in patients with brain tumors,\nspecifically those with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with an anti-angiogenic agent, and those with brain\nmelanoma metastases treated with an immunotherapy agent. Broader Impact: Improved quantitative multi-\nparametric DCE-MRI has a potential role in the assessment of all neurologic diseases that have a\nmicrovascular component. This technical work, particularly leveraging specific nonlinear temporal models\nduring image reconstruction, is likely to have implications for DCE-MRI of prostate, renal, breast, and liver\ntumors as well as outside of DCE-MRI. Importantly it addresses a critical unmet need in oncology in providing\na robust, reproducible, high spatio-temporal resolution and high spatial coverage biomarker as a potential end\npoint for clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents in cancer research.

In particular, non-\nneuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an aggressive form of this\ndisease, is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The main barriers against\ntherapeutic advances are a paucity of relevant disease models and a very poor understanding of the\nmechanisms that give rise to this phenotype. The process of protein synthesis has long been considered\nsubordinate to alterations at the levels of DNA and RNA in cancer etiology. However, work from our laboratory\nand others have revealed that protein synthesis control is a dynamic process that coordinates not only bulk\nmRNA translation, but also the specialized translation of distinct mRNAs important for cancer phenotypes.\nRecently, our laboratory has developed and characterized a new in vitro and in vivo toolkit of both human and\nmurine androgen receptor-low CRPC. We have used these models to discover a critical link between androgen\nreceptor signaling and the process of mRNA translation initiation, which is critical for androgen receptor-low\nCRPC growth. We hypothesize that androgen receptor-low CRPC is driven by the specific translation of\ndistinct mRNA networks, thereby leading to persistent tumor growth, which may represent a therapeutic\nvulnerability. Our long-term objective is to utilize state-of-the-art mouse models, ribosome profiling, and patient\nderived xenografts to definitively investigate the fundamental link between the androgen receptor and protein\nsynthesis control in a highly relevant and newly emerging disease course for prostate cancer patients.

The recent advent of highly potent inhibitors of the androgen receptor and androgen biosynthesis has\nhad the unfortunate iatrogenic effect of fueling new lethal prostate cancer phenotypes in patients. In particular,\ncastration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that is resistant to therapies such as enzalutamide and abiraterone\nare increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The main barriers against therapeutic\nadvances are a paucity of relevant disease models and a very poor understanding of the mechanisms that give\nrise to this phenotype. The process of protein synthesis has long been considered subordinate to alterations at\nthe levels of DNA and RNA in cancer etiology. However, work from our laboratory and others have revealed that\nprotein synthesis control is a dynamic process that coordinates not only bulk mRNA translation, but also the\nspecialized translation of distinct mRNAs important for cancer phenotypes.\nRecently, our laboratory has uncovered a new functional link between androgen receptor signaling and the\nprocess of mRNA translation initiation. We found that decreases in androgen receptor activity lead to a\ncompensatory increase in the activity of the eIF4F translation initiation complex which drives hormone signaling\nindependence in CRPC. Importantly, this is mediated through the translation of distinct subsets of mRNAs.\nBased on these findings, we hypothesize that aberrant mRNA translation of distinct gene networks enables\nresistance to nuclear hormone receptor inhibition and CRPC progression. Our long-term objective is to utilize\nstate-of-the-art patient derived models, ribosome profiling, and next-generation translation inhibitors to\ndefinitively investigate the fundamental link between the androgen receptor and protein synthesis control in a\nhighly relevant and newly emerging disease course for prostate cancer patients. To do so, we will address the\nfollowing aims: 1) determine how alterations in mRNA translation initiation promote resistance to AR pathway\ndirected therapies, and 2) delineate the translational gene networks that promote resistance to AR signaling\ninhibitors.\nUltimately, these studies are poised to uncover a new paradigm for gene regulation in nuclear hormone receptor\ninhibitor resistance and provide the preclinical basis for targeting the protein synthesis apparatus in an\nincreasingly common and highly aggressive disease.

With the recent success of anti-viral therapies, the etiology of HCC in the American population is\nprojected to shift from viral (HBV, HCV) hepatitis to primarily fatty liver disease in the near future.\nCurrently, only one effective systemic therapy has been developed for HCC – the multi-kinase inhibitor\nsorafenib. The development of more selective molecularly targeted therapies has so far been unsuccessful\nin this disease. This failure is due in part to the lack of a preclinical, patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-\nenabling HCC tumor bank drawn from an American HCC patient population to help patient selection and\nmodel new therapies. In addition, modeling underlying liver disease has rarely been pursued in preclinical\ndrug development. PDX-enabling tumor banks exist in Asia, but tend to be from viral and alcohol-driven\ndisease, as opposed to obesity, which is the driver of growing incidence in the West. Massachusetts General\nHospital (MGH) has begun collecting primary patient HCC tumors from surgeries performed in Boston\nand will partner with Woodland Pharmaceuticals, the applicant, to expand these into a PDX resource better\nenabling new HCC therapy development. Woodland will expand the tumors to up to five passages in mice\nand then characterize the passages for drug sensitivity, both in vitro and in vivo to a panel of drugs.\nDemonstration of stable expansion will lead to a phase 2 application to further expand and characterize the\nHCC tumor bank (including tracking of patient treatment and outcomes at the academic site), in models\nwith underlying liver disease, in readiness for PDX service commercialization in the USA.

project	2R44CA199826-02A1	2R44CA199826-02A1	9345822	2017	Commercialization of an MRI contrast agent for differential diagnosis of prostate cancer.	Abstract\n Prostate cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and the second most cause of cancer death of\nmen in the US. Current methods to assess prostate cancer risk combine prostate specific antigen (PSA)\nscreening and random prostate biopsy. Unfortunately, this strategy fails to reveal the lesion’s location and\ndoes not accurately differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers. As a result,\nmost patients will receive unnecessary active treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in order to avoid\nunder treatment. Active treatment involves surgery or radiation, often causing long-term side effects such\nas urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel urgency. Thus, development of non-invasive and\naccurate diagnostic imaging technology to localize and differentiate high-risk prostate cancer offer a new\ntool to assist physicians in risk-stratification and decision making and to spare millions patients with low-\nrisk cancer from unnecessary aggressive treatment.\n The mission of Molecular Theranostics (fka Prostate Theranostics) is to commercialize a novel\nmolecular imaging approach that targets an oncoprotein associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal\ntransition (EMT), cancer cell stemness, angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. The oncoprotein has\na high expression in the tumor extracellular matrix of high-risk prostate cancer, low in low-grade tumor,\nnone in normal tissues.

Abstract\n Prostate cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease and the second most cause of cancer death of\nmen in the US. Current methods to assess prostate cancer risk combine prostate specific antigen (PSA)\nscreening and random prostate biopsy. Unfortunately, this strategy fails to reveal the lesion’s location and\ndoes not accurately differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancers. As a result,\nmost patients will receive unnecessary active treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in order to avoid\nunder treatment. Active treatment involves surgery or radiation, often causing long-term side effects such\nas urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, or bowel urgency. Thus, development of non-invasive and\naccurate diagnostic imaging technology to localize and differentiate high-risk prostate cancer offer a new\ntool to assist physicians in risk-stratification and decision making and to spare millions patients with low-\nrisk cancer from unnecessary aggressive treatment.\n The mission of Molecular Theranostics (fka Prostate Theranostics) is to commercialize a novel\nmolecular imaging approach that targets an oncoprotein associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal\ntransition (EMT), cancer cell stemness, angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. The oncoprotein has\na high expression in the tumor extracellular matrix of high-risk prostate cancer, low in low-grade tumor,\nnone in normal tissues.

project	1R44CA217528-01A1	1R44CA217528-01A1	9410312	2017	Novel Fluorescent Diagnostic Agents for Detection, Staging, andIntraoperative Imaging of Tumors	Abstract\nThe goal of this project is to develop IV injectable fluorescent agents for use in intraoperative\nimaging of peritoneal metastatic tumors. Significance: Peritoneal metastatic cancers have an\nincidence of 250,000/per year in the US and are primarily treated with surgery. Complete surgical\ntumor resection is a gold-standard treatment goal that can increase the 5-year patient survival to\n50%, whereas incomplete tumor resection (<2mm) could drastically reduce the survival to a mere\nfew months. Current clinical imaging technologies such as PET, MRI and CT have limitations for\nguiding cancer surgery including inability to be used intraoperatively due to safety associated with\nionizing radiation, as well as limitations on sensitivity and tumor specificity especially for lesions\nsmaller than 10mm. Conventional fluorescent molecular probes in development typically target\ntumor proteins and are limited in imaging the heterogeneous onco-geno-phenotypes of peritoneal\nmetastasis that have multiple tissues of origin and vary in protein expression levels. In order to\nreduce incomplete tumor resection and improve survival, there is an urgent need for clear visual\ncontrast imaging agents that enable more precise and specific detection of peritoneal metastasis\ntumors intraoperatively and in real-time. Hypothesis: OncoNano’s approach of targeting tumor\nacidosis which is ubiquitously expressed as a cancer biomarker across tumors, coupled with\nOncoNano’s ultra-sensitive pH fluorescent digital sensors, provides a broad based approach to\nimage the heterogeneous peritoneal metastasis with high specificity and sensitivity. Preliminary\nData: We have demonstrated that OncoNano’s fluorescent agents image tumors across a variety\nof solid tumor types (14 tested to date), including peritoneal metastasis to submillimeter precision\nin SCID mouse models. OncoNano’s agents provided a digital (ON-OFF) response which offered\nclear tumor delineation, and lower detection limits (>10x) compared with state of the art PET-FDG\nimaging. Surgical tumor resection using OncoNano imaging agent showed significant (40-50%)\nsurvival benefit in SCID mouse models compared with conventional white light based surgery.\nSpecific Aims: The scientific aims of this project will enable OncoNano to clinically translate, the\nultrasensitive pH probes and develop it from the lab bench through to establishing reproducible\nmanufacturing of a stable formulation, to establishing safety and pharmacology, for an FDA IND\nfiling. The specific aims in the SBIR Phase I, addresses the nanoprobe stability requirement, and\naddresses the nanoprobe sensitivity and specificity requirement in in-vivo models. The specific\naims in Phase 2 of the project addresses the critical milestones on the path to clinical translation\nincluding- the scale-up requirement to meet the GLP and human testing needs, a demonstration\nof product safety in GLP in-vivo studies, culminating in an IND filing with the FDA.

project	5R44CA217528-03	5R44CA217528-03	9786678	2019	Novel Fluorescent Diagnostic Agents for Detection, Staging, andIntraoperative Imaging of Tumors	Abstract\nThe goal of this project is to develop IV injectable fluorescent agents for use in intraoperative\nimaging of peritoneal metastatic tumors. Significance: Peritoneal metastatic cancers have an\nincidence of 250,000/per year in the US and are primarily treated with surgery. Complete surgical\ntumor resection is a gold-standard treatment goal that can increase the 5-year patient survival to\n50%, whereas incomplete tumor resection (<2mm) could drastically reduce the survival to a mere\nfew months. Current clinical imaging technologies such as PET, MRI and CT have limitations for\nguiding cancer surgery including inability to be used intraoperatively due to safety associated with\nionizing radiation, as well as limitations on sensitivity and tumor specificity especially for lesions\nsmaller than 10mm. Conventional fluorescent molecular probes in development typically target\ntumor proteins and are limited in imaging the heterogeneous onco-geno-phenotypes of peritoneal\nmetastasis that have multiple tissues of origin and vary in protein expression levels. In order to\nreduce incomplete tumor resection and improve survival, there is an urgent need for clear visual\ncontrast imaging agents that enable more precise and specific detection of peritoneal metastasis\ntumors intraoperatively and in real-time. Hypothesis: OncoNano’s approach of targeting tumor\nacidosis which is ubiquitously expressed as a cancer biomarker across tumors, coupled with\nOncoNano’s ultra-sensitive pH fluorescent digital sensors, provides a broad based approach to\nimage the heterogeneous peritoneal metastasis with high specificity and sensitivity. Preliminary\nData: We have demonstrated that OncoNano’s fluorescent agents image tumors across a variety\nof solid tumor types (14 tested to date), including peritoneal metastasis to submillimeter precision\nin SCID mouse models. OncoNano’s agents provided a digital (ON-OFF) response which offered\nclear tumor delineation, and lower detection limits (>10x) compared with state of the art PET-FDG\nimaging. Surgical tumor resection using OncoNano imaging agent showed significant (40-50%)\nsurvival benefit in SCID mouse models compared with conventional white light based surgery.\nSpecific Aims: The scientific aims of this project will enable OncoNano to clinically translate, the\nultrasensitive pH probes and develop it from the lab bench through to establishing reproducible\nmanufacturing of a stable formulation, to establishing safety and pharmacology, for an FDA IND\nfiling.

Cancer\nimmunotherapies that harness the body's immune system to help fight cancer do not\nwork for everyone; in fact, success rates can be as low as 20%. This means that up to\n80% of patients undergoing immunotherapy are spending over $100,000 and investing 6\nto 10 months on ineffective treatments. Our lead imaging tracer, [18F]-FAraG product\nnamed VisAcT, leverages existing health and PET imaging infrastructure but is specific\nfor visualizing immune response. This whole body visualization will provide clinicians\ncritical information to help make early decisions in the treatment regimen and increase\nchances of patient survival.\nCellSight is partnering with pharma and academia on various projects to validate this\ncritically needed immune response monitoring tool as immunotherapies and\ncombinational therapies are showing great promise. The sheer number of combinations\nare staggering yet there are no blood biomarkers or imaging tools available that can be\npredictive of responders versus nonresponders. Even if accurate blood biomarkers were\nto became available in the near future, whole body imaging will still be critically needed\nto determine local immune response site by site in the metastatic patient who are the\nones being administered immunotherapies. Clinical symptoms during immunotherapy\nare very perplexing, as it might seem a patient is progressing when in fact their immune\nsystem is actively fighting the cancer or there might be a delay before immune response\nis apparent through traditional measures.

Our team, including Michael Karin, Ph.D. and Shabnam Shalapour, Ph.D. at UCSD School of Medicine\nand Hidekazu Tsukamoto, D.V.M., Ph.D. and Anthony El-Khoueiry, M.D. at USC Keck School of Medicine,\nrepresents an ideal blend of basic researchers, translational scientists and oncologists who are interested in\nHCC molecular pathogenesis and treatment, especially in HCC caused by non-alcoholic (NASH) and alcoholic\n(ASH) steatohepatitis. Although the US incidence of HCC and its associated mortality have nearly tripled in the\npast generation, insufficient effort has been made toward identification and development of innovative and\neffective HCC therapies. However, the ideal and timely confluence of basic preclinical research and applied\nclinical studies carried out by our team members has the potential to critically transform HCC treatment forever.\nTogether we found that chronic liver inflammation results in suppression of HCC-protective immunosurveillance\nto support rapid malignant progression. This unique immunopathogenic mechanism renders HCC responsive to\ndrugs that disrupt the PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint, but even the impressive response seen thus far and the selection\nof patients who will benefit from this therapeutic approach can be further improved. Such improvements can only\nbe achieved by a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitors act, the factors\nthat determine their efficacy, and the causes of treatment failure. We will achieve these goals through integrated\nstudies of clinical specimens collected by Dr. El-Khoueiry and sophisticated, faithful and robust mouse models\nof non-viral HCC developed by Drs. Tsukamoto, Shalapour, and Karin. The immune mechanisms that control\nNASH- and ASH-driven HCC development in these models are highly similar to those that operate in human\npatients. Using this integrated approach, we will pursue five specific aims: 1) determine whether serum IgA\nconcentrations correlate with therapeutic response to PD-1 blockade in patients with non-viral HCC; 2) develop\nreliable mouse models of ASH-driven HCC; 3) compare the immunosuppressive mechanisms that contribute to\ndevelopment of NASH- and ASH-driven HCC and control their response to PD-L1 blockade; 4) determine\nwhether excessive peritumoral fibrosis correlates with diminished response to PD-1 blockade in HCC patients;\nand 5) determine whether agents that inhibit or attenuate stellate cell activation potentiate the response to PD-\n1/PD-L1 blockade in non-viral HCC. The successful completion of these studies will result in substantial\nimprovements to HCC immunotherapy and will establish reliable procedures for identification of patients who are\nmost likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 targeting drugs, advances that will result in significant cost savings which\nmay amount to hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

We will achieve these goals through integrated\nstudies of clinical specimens collected by Dr. El-Khoueiry and sophisticated, faithful and robust mouse models\nof non-viral HCC developed by Drs. Tsukamoto, Shalapour, and Karin. The immune mechanisms that control\nNASH- and ASH-driven HCC development in these models are highly similar to those that operate in human\npatients. Using this integrated approach, we will pursue five specific aims: 1) determine whether serum IgA\nconcentrations correlate with therapeutic response to PD-1 blockade in patients with non-viral HCC; 2) develop\nreliable mouse models of ASH-driven HCC; 3) compare the immunosuppressive mechanisms that contribute to\ndevelopment of NASH- and ASH-driven HCC and control their response to PD-L1 blockade; 4) determine\nwhether excessive peritumoral fibrosis correlates with diminished response to PD-1 blockade in HCC patients;\nand 5) determine whether agents that inhibit or attenuate stellate cell activation potentiate the response to PD-\n1/PD-L1 blockade in non-viral HCC. The successful completion of these studies will result in substantial\nimprovements to HCC immunotherapy and will establish reliable procedures for identification of patients who are\nmost likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 targeting drugs, advances that will result in significant cost savings which\nmay amount to hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

Our team, including Michael Karin, Ph.D. and Shabnam Shalapour, Ph.D. at UCSD School of Medicine\nand Hidekazu Tsukamoto, D.V.M., Ph.D. and Anthony El-Khoueiry, M.D. at USC Keck School of Medicine,\nrepresents an ideal blend of basic researchers, translational scientists and oncologists who are interested in\nHCC molecular pathogenesis and treatment, especially in HCC caused by non-alcoholic (NASH) and alcoholic\n(ASH) steatohepatitis. Although the US incidence of HCC and its associated mortality have nearly tripled in the\npast generation, insufficient effort has been made toward identification and development of innovative and\neffective HCC therapies. However, the ideal and timely confluence of basic preclinical research and applied\nclinical studies carried out by our team members has the potential to critically transform HCC treatment forever.\nTogether we found that chronic liver inflammation results in suppression of HCC-protective immunosurveillance\nto support rapid malignant progression. This unique immunopathogenic mechanism renders HCC responsive to\ndrugs that disrupt the PD-1:PD-L1 checkpoint, but even the impressive response seen thus far and the selection\nof patients who will benefit from this therapeutic approach can be further improved. Such improvements can only\nbe achieved by a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which PD-1:PD-L1 inhibitors act, the factors\nthat determine their efficacy, and the causes of treatment failure. We will achieve these goals through integrated\nstudies of clinical specimens collected by Dr. El-Khoueiry and sophisticated, faithful and robust mouse models\nof non-viral HCC developed by Drs.

U01 Abstract\nDespite extensive research into cancer immunotherapy, immune-related adverse events (irAE)\nremain a critical and poorly understood issue. To address this critical need, we have assembled a\nmultidisciplinary research team with broad and relevant expertise. The co-PIs of this proposal have\nexpertise in cancer immunotherapy, immunology, assay development, and bioinformatics. Together, we\nhave assembled a cohort of ~400 cancer patients treated with ICI, collecting longitudinal treatment, efficacy,\nand toxicity data, as well as blood samples at pre-treatment baseline, throughout therapy, and at time of\ntoxicity. In our real-world data set, over 10 percent of cases have a history of autoimmune disease,\nproviding insight into use of ICI in a population widely excluded from clinical trials yet routinely treated with\nthese therapies off protocol. Our high-quality clinical data annotation—without which correlative studies\nhave little meaning—addresses the reality that irAE may occur months after ICI initiation and are far more\ncomplex to detect and characterize than toxicities of conventional chemotherapy or molecularly targeted\ntherapies. Through existing funding mechanisms, we have already completed autoantibody, cytokine,\ngenetic, and functional assays in these cases. However, we do not currently have resources for\ncomprehensive, integrated analysis of these diverse laboratory and clinical data. The overarching goal of\nthis U01 proposal is to determine the optimal balance between ICI efficacy and toxicity, ultimately\nidentifying a set of biomarkers useful for selection of patients, treatment type and duration, and\nclinical monitoring. We will achieve this through determination of cellular immunity, comprehensive data\nanalysis, and clinical validation. We have three Aims: (1) Determine cellular immunity in patients\nexperiencing irAE and/or achieving beneficial responses from ICI. We will perform mass cytometry\n(CyTOF) and T-cell receptor sequencing at multiple time-points. (2) Determine genetic, humoral, and\ncellular factors associated with irAE and/or beneficial responses from ICI. We will develop a database\nto integrate and analyze the CyTOF and T-cell receptor sequencing data with clinical efficacy and toxicity\ndata, as well as data from the assays already completed through other mechanisms. (3) Perform analytical\nand clinical validation of emerging biomarkers. We will apply the best classifying phenotypes emerging\nfrom our comprehensive and integrated data analysis to a test set of patients from our existing cohort,\neventually identifying a subset of biomarkers with potential for clinical application. Together, these Aims\ndirectly address the FOA purpose of reducing the incidence and/or severity of irAE while retaining anti-\ntumor efficacy.

At baseline, the cohort included information on\n215,000 men and women, comprised almost entirely of five ethnic/racial populations: Caucasians, Japanese\nAmericans, Native Hawaiians, African Americans, and Latinos. The resource was later expanded to include a\nprospective biorepository of blood and urine specimens from ~70,000 of the participants. Leadership of the\nMEC entails a highly interactive, team approach; and the investigators have amply demonstrated their\nwillingness to share data/samples, and to participate actively in consortia. This application describes our aims\nover the next 5 years for maintaining and enhancing the infrastructure of the MEC, as well as plans for\nmethodological research. Research accomplishments include significant contributions to understanding both\ngenetic and environmental risk factors for cancer. Over 280 papers describing our findings have been\npublished during the current grant cycle. In addition, over the last 20 years, 98 research grants have been built\naround the MEC, and more than 75 students and postdoctoral fellows have been trained on the study. This\ngrant renewal will make possible the continuation of a well-integrated program of research aimed at evaluating\nenvironmental and genetic risk factors for cancer and other common chronic diseases, taking advantage of\nnew approaches, such as genomics, microbiomics, adductomics and metabolomics. The MEC will allow the\ntesting of innovative research hypotheses aimed at ensuring that progress in prevention applies to major US\nethnic/racial minorities.

The purpose of this supplement is to better understand the very high risk of Japanese Americans for\ncolorectal cancer by comparing risk factors and cancer-related biomarkers between two populations with\nsubstantially different risks: Japanese Americans participating in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) and Japanese\nparticipants in the Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study (JPHC) Cohort. These two cohorts\nconducted on genetically similar populations, have very comparable community-based designs,\nquestionnaires, biospecimen collection protocols and time course. Therefore, they provide a unique opportunity\nto better understand similarities and differences in incidence trends and risk factors for cancer in these two\npopulations. In Aim 1, we propose to validate a blood biomarker-based score for visceral adipose tissue\n(VAT), originally developed in MEC, among 140 healthy Tokyo middle-aged adults with VAT measurement\navailable. This score was associated with colorectal cancer in Japanese Americans in MEC, independently of\nBMI and other risk factors, suggesting that VAT, a type of fat disproportionally abundant in Japanese\nAmericans, may play an important role in explaining their high risk for the disease. In contrast, obesity has\nremained rare in Japan. In Aim 2, we propose to formally compare risk factors for colorectal cancer in\nJapanese between MEC (N=2,092 cases) and JPHC (N=2,600 cases). We will focus on risk factors particularly\nrelevant to Japanese Americans, such as VAT and VAT-related nutritional components, and investigate\nwhether they explain differences in incidence of colorectal cancer between the two cohorts. These risk factors\ninclude: for prospective analyses: diet quality (Healthy Eating Index-2015, Japanese Diet Index), intakes of\ndietary components (e.g., sugars, fat, dietary fiber, red meat, well-done meat, alcohol), physical activity, BMI,\nand smoking, and for nested case-control studies (381 cases / 381 controls in MEC; 375 cases / controls in\nJPHC): the VAT biomarker score and cancer-related biomarkers (IGF-I, IGFBP3, insulin, HOMA-IR, leptin,\nadiponectin, SHBG). The similarity of genetic ancestry will be confirmed based on available GWAS data. By\ncontributing very similar data from an outside comparison population, this supplement will further the parent\nU01 CA164973 grant’s aim to better understand reasons for ethnic/racial disparities in cancer by focusing on\nJapanese Americans, a rarely-studied population.

New technologies, including screening tests and vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually-transmitted virus known to cause cervical cancer, represent tremendous opportunities for innovative and efficient cervical cancer programs in the U.S. but also pose significant challenges for decision making, due to the complex and long natural history of disease and the different time points along the disease spectrum at which interventions are applied.

There has been a growing number of independent mathematical models that have been developed to address clinical and policy questions with respect to cervical cancer prevention and control but no formal efforts to compare assumptions and results across models. As part of the CISNET consortium, a group of established cervical cancer modelers from the U.S., Australia, and the Netherlands will engage in a formal collaboration of comparative modeling using a series of state-of-the-art mathematical models of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis.

Although recent\nmodeling studies have corrected for hysterectomy and found evidence that extending screening to ages 70 or\n75 years may warrant consideration, areas of uncertainty regarding the optimal screening end criteria remain.\nThese include the potential impact of declining rates of hysterectomy and changes in life expectancy, which\nmay impact the absolute number of women who are at risk for cervical cancer and can benefit from screening\nat older ages. There is also uncertainty about whether women who came of age during the sexual revolution\n(and are now entering the age range to end screening) have a greater baseline risk for cancer that may remain\neven after a lifetime of screening.\nThere is also uncertainty at the woman-level regarding the clinical implications of a newly-detected HPV\ninfection in older women. On one hand, the HPV infection may be newly acquired, conferring similar risk of\ncervical disease as incident infections in younger women. On the other hand, the HPV infection may be a\n“reactivation” of a previously-acquired latent infection and may therefore confer differential risk for cervical\ndisease than a truly new infection. The extent to which these scenarios impact the optimal screening end age\nfor a particular woman has not been studied, but can be explored through modeling.\nWe propose to conduct a comparative modeling study reexamining assumptions about the natural history of\nHPV infection in older women in order to assess existing and new strategies for termination of screening in\nU.S. women. Specifically we propose to: Aim 1. To examine the relative impacts of HPV reactivation versus\nnew infection on cervical cancer risk at the individual woman level; Aim 2. To compare the harms and benefits\nof current and alternative criteria (ages, algorithms, and tests) for ending screening under these alternative\nscenarios, for HPV-positive women with either new or reactivated infections; Aim 3. To identify areas of\nuncertainty that could benefit from a value of information analysis.\nThis analysis will allow greater understanding of the impact of natural history assumptions on cancer incidence\nin subgroups of older women, depending on the details of their exposure to HPV. Additionally, we will evaluate\nthe impact of natural history and screening termination criteria on a variety of harm and benefit metrics for\ncervical cancer screening.

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:\nCurrent methods of preclinical testing of potential therapeutics have been, for the most part, underwhelming in\nterms of their ability to yield a clinical impact. Moreover, preclinical investigation of cancer therapy resistance\nmechanisms faces similar challenges due, at least in part, to both limitations of the preclinical model systems\nand lack of reliable biomarkers. A prime example is glioblastoma (GBM) with few therapeutic options yielding\nincredibly poor outcomes (5-year survival <4%) despite nearly eight decades of research. Indeed, current\nstandard of care (SOC) therapy includes maximal safe surgical resection followed by fractionated irradiation and\ntemozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. These patients tend to fall into two categories: those who have inherent\nresistance to radiation and TMZ and those who acquire resistance to those therapies (typically within 6 months).\nWhile many groups have tried to develop more effective therapeutics or overcome GBM resistance mechanisms,\nvirtually all attempts have relied on highly artificial models under major growth promoting conditions that select\nfor highly proliferative tumors that no longer resemble the patient’s tumor. To address these issues, investigators\nare increasingly utilizing patient-derived models of cancer (PDMC) coupled with comprehensive molecular\nprofiling to build more reliable models for examining therapeutic resistance and for developing novel therapies.\nBuilding on a series of collaborations and funded projects, our investigative team has developed a large panel\nof GBM xenografts (PDX) that can be cultured without serum as derivative PDMC models including spheroids\n(neurospheres) and matrix-embedded microtumors. Our parent U01 (U01-CA223976) seeks to investigate tumor\nmicroenvironmental (TME) stressors on these 3 PDMC models in terms of molecular biology (e.g., transcriptome\nand kinome similarity) and phenotype (e.g., radiation and TMZ response) fidelity. In this U01 Revision\nApplication, we seek to extend our work by developing new in vitro and in vivo models to investigate inherent\nand acquired resistance to SOC GBM therapy. We have characterized baseline in vivo radiation and TMZ\nsensitivity in 20 of our GBM PDX and have developed 8 radiation resistant and 5 TMZ resistant isogenic lines\nfrom initially sensitive tumors. Transcriptomic and kinomic testing of these pairs have identified several genes\nand kinases associated with resistance. We will leverage this very unique resource to examine SOC therapeutic\nresistance. Aim 1 utilizes a high-throughput geospatially controlled 3D bioprinting system to replicate in vivo\nconditions by using co-culture of PDX cells and vascular endothelial cells in a variety of matrices with and without\nother TME stressors (e.g. hypoxia and nutrient deprivation seen in patients). These constructs will be tested in\nup to 384-well format to facilitate inhibition of high-priority targets of SOC resistance as identified from our\ntranscriptomic and kinomic profiling. Aim 2 will explore the role of the gut microbiome, an understudied host TME\nfactor, in SOC therapeutic resistance as our preliminary data indicate that the gut microbiome alters TMZ\nsensitivity. Selected PDX will be grown in the brains of Rag1-/- mice with human fecal transplants for SOC testing.	3-Dimensional;Address;Area;Biological Markers;Biological Models;Brain;Cancer Biology;Cancer Model;Categories;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Coculture Techniques;Collaborations;Complex;Coupled;Data;Dexamethasone;Diagnosis;Elements;Endothelial Cells;Epithelial;Epithelium;Excision;Extracellular Matrix;Face;Failure;Funding;Genes;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Growth;Human;Hypoxia;Implant;In Vitro;Incidence;Inter-tumoral heterogeneity;Investigation;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Modeling;Molecular Biology;Molecular Profiling;Mus;Nutrient;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Oxygen;Parents;Pathogenicity;Patients;Pattern;Phenotype;Phosphotransferases;Physiological;Play;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Publishing;Radiation;Rag1 Mouse;Recurrence;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resources;Role;Selection for Treatments;Series;Serum;System;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Therapeutic;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Treatment-related toxicity;Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole;Tumor Biology;Tumor Debulking;Vascular Endothelial Cell;Work;World Health Organization;Xenograft procedure;acquired treatment resistance;aggressive therapy;base;bioprinting;cancer drug resistance;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;differential expression;falls;fecal transplantation;gut microbiome;human disease;human microbiota;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;irradiation;knock-down;microbiome;microbiome alteration;microorganism;molecular subtypes;neglect;neoplastic cell;novel therapeutics;nutrient deprivation;pre-clinical;preclinical study;profiles in patients;radioresistant;resistance mechanism;response;small hairpin RNA;small molecule inhibitor;standard of care;stressor;temozolomide;therapy resistant;tool;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor microenvironment;virtual	UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM	BIRMINGHAM	AL	UNITED STATES	G.

We believe that a \ncareful investigation of tumor microenvironmental (TME) stressors on 3 patient­derived models (xenolines) of \nGBM, namely xenografts (PDX), spheroid cultures (neurospheres), and human biomatrix embedded 3D \nmicrotumors, will provide insight into critical aspects of tumor biology that are influenced by model and TME. \nThese models pre­ and post­ TME perturbagen will also be comprehensively profiled at the genomic, \ntranscriptomic, and kinomic (global kinase activity assessment through a peptide substrate microarray) level to \ngenerate a similarity distance metric. We hypothesize that application of TME stressors to the PDMC’s will \nimprove both molecular and biological fidelity of the respective models to that of the original tumor or parent \nxenoline that can be visualized and in silico tested using an advanced computational data modeling system \n(GeneTerrain). Our preliminary data generated from prior NIH funded projects indicate that our existing xenolines \nrecapitulate all four molecular subtypes of GBM identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas while reproducing the \nkey hallmarks of GBM when implanted orthotopically in immunocompromised mice. Importantly, we can grow \ndisaggregated xenoline tumors in a novel three-dimensional (3D) culture system incorporating many cells of the \ntumor microenvironment to produce 3D microtumors suitable for higher throughput drug testing. Moreover, we \nhave preliminary evidence that TME manipulation of BTICs or 3D microtumors (e.g., hypoxia or nutrient \ndeprivation) promotes a more aggressive tumor phenotype in vitro and in vivo that is accompanied by changes \nin kinomic signatures. Therefore, we will: 1) Generate 3 PDMC models from existing xenolines as well as de \nnovo GBM patient tumors with comprehensive omic testing to calculate similarity distance metrics among the \nmodels with corresponding biological assessments including growth, chemoradiation sensitivity, and stemness \nmarkers;; 2) Perform TME perturbagen testing of the derivative PDMCs (neurospheres and 3D microtumors) and \ndetermine impact on tumor biology and similarity distance metric;; 3) Develop and validate GeneTerrain models \nof the various PDMCs with respect to TME and therapeutic sensitivity (radiation and temozolomide).	3-Dimensional;Address;Behavior;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Models;Biology;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Cancer Biology;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Fraction;Cell Line;Cell Proliferation;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Communities;Complex;Computer Models;Consensus;Coupled;Data;Data Science;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Elements;Environment;Exhibits;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Failure;Funding;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Glioblastoma;Glioma;Glucose;Goals;Gold;Grant;Growth;Growth Factor;Human;Hypoxia;Immunocompromised Host;Implant;In Vitro;Investigation;Knowledge;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurable;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mus;Nutrient;Oxygen;Parents;Patient Selection;Patients;Peptides;Performance;Phenotype;Phosphotransferases;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Predictive Cancer Model;Prognosis;Property;Radiation;Radiation Tolerance;Radiation therapy;Reproducibility;Research Personnel;Sampling;Serum;Signal Transduction;Standard Model;Stress;System;Testing;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Therapeutic;Tumor Biology;Tumor Stem Cells;United States National Institutes of Health;Xenograft procedure;anticancer research;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cell immortalization;chemoradiation;clinical practice;cost;data modeling;drug development;drug discovery;drug testing;established cell line;expectation;experience;human disease;human model;improved;in silico;in vivo;insight;molecular subtypes;multidisciplinary;neoplastic cell;novel;nutrient deprivation;patient derived xenograft model;patient response;pre-clinical;preclinical study;pressure;standard of care;stem;stem-like cell;stemness;stressor;temozolomide;therapy resistant;three dimensional cell culture;tool;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;vector	UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM	BIRMINGHAM	AL	UNITED STATES	Jake Yue Chen,Xiangqin  Cui,G.

This is particularly true for glioblastoma (GBM) where prognosis \nhas increased only by 2-3 months over the last 75 years with a 5-year survival of less than 4%. Many promising \npreclinical studies have failed to live up to expectations when tested clinically. This problem is likely due to: a) \nlimitations of the preclinical model system and b) lack of reliable biomarkers for proper patient selection. To \naddress these issues, investigators are increasingly utilizing patient-­derived models of cancer (PDMC) coupled \nwith comprehensive molecular profiling. However, differences in model composition, growth conditions, and \nother microenvironmental factors limit reliability of these models and hamper interpretation. We believe that a \ncareful investigation of tumor microenvironmental (TME) stressors on 3 patient­derived models (xenolines) of \nGBM, namely xenografts (PDX), spheroid cultures (neurospheres), and human biomatrix embedded 3D \nmicrotumors, will provide insight into critical aspects of tumor biology that are influenced by model and TME. \nThese models pre­ and post­ TME perturbagen will also be comprehensively profiled at the genomic, \ntranscriptomic, and kinomic (global kinase activity assessment through a peptide substrate microarray) level to \ngenerate a similarity distance metric.

One possible reason for this is the unique biology of the pancreatic cancer in\nestablishing an immune suppressive microenvironment. We find that cross communication\nbetween cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and\ntumor cells is critical. Using animal models of PDA, we find that tumor cells polarize\nmacrophages to TAMs both by activating CAFs to produce IL6 and by producing specific\nmetabolites. TAMs then both suppress the immune response by arginine depletion by making\nArginase 1 and by producing EGFR ligands, primarily HBEGF, to stimulate pancreatic cancer\ncells to express PDL1, an immune checkpoint ligand. We propose to use a combination of\nmatched humanized patient derived xenografts (PDXs), organoid culture systems made up of\ncancer cells, immune cells and CAFs (ie “microtumors”) and a unique dual recombinase\ngenetically engineered mouse model of PDA to test the hypothesis that treatment of tumors with\ninhibitors of STAT3, HBEGF, ARG1 or MEK will effectively synergize with PD1 inhibition,\novercoming the powerful immune suppression created by the pancreatic cancer\nmicroenvironment.

Pet dogs share their environment, and oftentimes their diet, with their owners. Dogs and\nhumans develop sporadic benign and malignant brain tumors at about the same rate and with similar\nhistopathology. Dogs are often euthanized due to the cost of care. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine\nbrain tumor represents an ideal opportunity to improve the lives of people as well as pets through comparative\noncology and genomics and the “One Medicine” approach to research and direct clinical application. We propose\na multi-institutional consortium to test an innovative combinatorial immunotherapeutic approach in dogs that\nspontaneously and sporadically develop malignant glial brain tumors that resemble in most important aspects,\nhigh-grade malignant gliomas in humans. Our approach will inject a clinical grade oncolytic herpes simplex virus\n(HSV) M032 that expresses human interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the resected tumor bed. Dog lymphocytes fully\nrespond to human IL-12 [1] and oncolytic HSV infect and kill canine (as well as mouse, non-human primate,\nhuman) tumor cells, creating a potent local inflammatory response and an antigen-rich tumor cell debris field.\nTherefore, we would anticipate that this virally-based immunotherapeutic approach would likely be as effective\nin dogs with brain tumors as in humans with brain tumors. We will conduct longitudinal safety, survival and\ncorrelative biology evaluations as a means of assessing the dog as an appropriate and informative model for\ndesign and implementation of clinical studies in humans with high-grade malignant brain tumors. To extend these\nfindings, we propose, in subsequent studies, to combine the HSV immunotherapy approach with molecules that\nblock the action of innate checkpoint inhibitor(s). These studies are designed to address key issues of safety\nand efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy in the dog that can be translated to humans with malignant gliomas.\nMalignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in humans, accounting for 30% of all primary\ncentral nervous system (CNS) tumors in adults. [2] With few major advances in decades, there has been no\nsignificant reduction in mortality and only a modest improvement in median survival. Recently, objective\nresponses and long-term survivals have been observed in human glioma patients who have received oncolytic\nvirotherapy and a Phase I trial is currently underway at UAB in patients using M032 alone. New approaches to\nutilize checkpoint inhibitors promises improved efficacy, but the ability to develop more effective combinatorial\napproaches has been slow, in large part due to lack of a faithful model of spontaneous glioblastoma multiforme\n(GBM) in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, the spontaneously occurring canine brain tumor represents an ideal\nopportunity to improve the lives of people and pets through comparative oncology and genomics using the “One\nMedicine“ approach to research and direct clinical application.

Determine the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in spontaneous\ncanine GBM in combination with standard of care, and 2. Assess the efficacy of immune-mediated gene\ntherapy in combination with CD200 blockade to enhance anti-glioma immunotherapy.

This work is targeted to dogs with typically lethal, naturally occurring osteosarcoma (OSA)\nand melanoma, and the findings are expected to have important relevance for the design and translation of\ninnovative immunotherapy approaches in humans. Inhaled (IH) IL-15 offers the advantages of local delivery of\nthis immune-stimulatory cytokine, while limiting systemic exposure and thus potential toxicity. Super-agonist IL-\n15 offers increased half-life and greater anti-tumor effects. Therefore, each of these cytokines is anticipated to\nalter the risk/benefit ratio in favor of their use. To accomplish these objectives, we propose the following three\nspecific aims: 1) Targeting gross pulmonary metastases (OSA and melanoma) with first-in-dog delivery of\ninhaled (IH) human IL-15 and super-agonist IL-15; 2) Phase II trial of IH IL-15 and autologous NK cells to treat\ngross OSA and melanoma pulmonary metastases, and; 3) Targeting micro-metastatic disease using super-\nagonist IL-15 in primary OSA. The canine model represents a powerful tool in cancer immunotherapy research\nas an important link between murine models and human clinical studies. Dogs represent an attractive outbred\ncombination of companion animals that experience spontaneous cancer development in the setting of an intact\nimmune system. Importantly, these studies are designed to evaluate novel treatment combinations for\nadvanced pulmonary metastases in the setting of gross disease, but also will determine the impact of this\napproach as first-line therapy when combined with standard-of-care treatments. Moreover, this work seeks to\nelucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate an anti-tumor response (or non-response) in\ndogs with naturally occurring cancers. We will have the unique opportunity to perform whole exome\nsequencing and RNASeq on tumor tissue pre- and post-immunotherapy, and we will investigate whether a\nsignature of mutational landscape and gene expression profiles can be developed to prospectively predict\noutcome and response to immune therapies. We will correlate these data to immunohistochemical, flow\ncytometry, and serum cytokine readouts for evidence of transition from “cold” to “hot” tumors predictive of\nfavorable long term outcome. Hence, these canine trials and bio-marker studies represent an ideal strategy to\ninform and facilitate the rapid translation of novel, potentially high impact immune therapies to human patients\nwith aggressive cancers.

In fact, humans and dogs share a paired\nevolutionary history which has led to greater similarities between canine and human genomes\nand microbiomes than between mouse and human. Together, these traits make dogs an\nadvantageous translational model to study cancer immunology and cancer immunotherapy, and\ndog clinical trials allow for the study of complex immune interactions during therapy while also\naddressing long-term efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapies. However, immune\ndissection requires the development of robust and validated assays and reagents, and a deeper\nunderstanding of dog immunology and immune biomarkers is necessary to achieve high impact\ntranslational studies, especially in the context of natural killer (NK) cells where significant\nspecies differences are known to exist. This proposal will build on exciting data from the\ncollaborating institutions with significant expertise in comparative oncology and novel\nimmunotherapy trials underway. Using pre- and on-treatment PBMC samples from dogs on trial\nreceiving novel and “first-in-class” immunotherapies which stimulate NK cells, we will use RNA\nsequencing to examine NK differential gene expression to 1) establish robust and validated\ngene signatures of resting and activated dog NK cells from both clinical trial cohorts; 2) analyze\nNK gene signatures from responding and non-responding patients; and 3) evaluate for\nsimilarities and differences in NK gene signatures between respective NK stimulatory\nimmunotherapies which are anticipated to have overlapping, but distinct, mechanisms of action.\nResults from this proposal will extend the important link that canine studies provide between\nmurine pre-clinical studies and human clinical trials and facilitate the rapid translation of novel,\npotentially high impact NK therapies to both dog and human patients with aggressive cancers.

The team comprises of world-class expert junior and senior investigators in a broad range of\nhighly relevant disciplines from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Meyer Cancer Center at the Weill\nCornell Medical Center, Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Institute\nfor Advanced Study. This initiative is directly relevant to the primary objective to develop novel biomarkers and\nT cell antigenic targets for the successful application of immunotherapy in PDAC.

Indeed, canine OS has historically been used to help develop\nnovel limb spare techniques, evaluate a variety of non-specific immunotherapeutics such as L-MTP-PE, and\nassess the efficacy of targeted therapeutics to prevent the outgrowth of metastatic disease. Despite best efforts,\nprogress in the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease has essentially stalled for the past 3 decades;\n30% of people and 90% of dogs still die of tumor spread, primarily to the lungs. Numerous clinical trials have\nbeen undertaken in people with macroscopic metastases and in dogs with both microscopic and macroscopic\ndisease, yet all have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes. This is particularly evident with respect to\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors that do not induce the dramatic disease regressions typically observed in other\ncancers such as melanoma and lung cancer. One particularly daunting challenge for immunotherapy-based\ntherapeutics in OS relates to the permissiveness of the tumor microenvironment (TME) for inducing anti-tumor\nimmune responses. Our data suggests that a relatively low mutational load combined with a dampened overall\nimmune response in OS may contribute to the observed lack of response to current treatment approaches. We\npropose that targeting the immune suppressive TME in OS is essential to generating potent and durable anti-\ntumor immunity. To accomplish this, it may be necessary to simultaneously modulate several elements in the\nTME, including Tregs, MDSCs, M2 macrophages and overexpressed inhibitory checkpoint molecules. In support\nof this, we have generated a body of data demonstrating immunological activity of multiple therapeutics, including\nrepurposed drugs with good safety records (losartan, oclacitinib), small molecule inhibitors with established\nPK/PD in dogs (toceranib, RV1001, reparixin, JHU-292) and antibodies specific for checkpoint molecules (anti-\nPD1). However, the exact combinations that are most effective against metastatic OS have not yet been\nidentified, and this is a major goal of this proposal. As such, we hypothesize that an adaptive pilot trial design\ncan be used to rapidly screen TME-targeting immunotherapy drug combinations in dogs with\nmacroscopic chemotherapy-resistant metastatic OS and that this information can be refined to assess\nactivity of the most active approach against microscopic metastases in a subsequent adjuvant trial. This\nwill be accomplished by testing four TME modifying immunotherapy combinations for anti-tumor and immune\nmodulatory activity in dogs with macroscopic OS metastases, interrogating relevant biomarkers associated with\nresponses to therapy, then using this information to conduct an adjuvant immunotherapy trial with the most active\ncombination in dogs with microscopic metastatic OS. The data generated from this proposal will create a\nblueprint for future immunotherapy studies in people with OS by eliminating approaches deemed inactive\nand generating a set of clinical biomarkers to guide treatment.

project	3U01CA224193-02S1	3U01CA224193-02S1	10286890	2021	Stopping PDA progression using inhibitors of CSC dissemination and immunotherapy	PROJECT SUMMARY\nPancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) is often called the silent serial killer, because it rarely causes\nsymptoms and metastases have already spread from the pancreas to distant organs before the primary tumor\ncan be detected. Moreover, the existing metastases may give rise to new metastases through dissemination of\ncancer stem cells as seen in breast carcinoma. Current standard of care regimens for advanced disease, such\nas Abraxane plus gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX, have modestly improved survival, albeit at the cost of significant\nmorbidity, and neither is curative. This underlines the need for new and/or additional approaches. Two issues\nneed to be addressed in a concerted manner: 1) blocking the dissemination of cancer cells from the primary and\nmetastatic sites, and 2) simultaneously eradicating existing primary tumors and metastases because metastases\nsupport continuous new CTC dissemination with metastasis-seeding potential. The intersection between cell-\nautonomous mechanisms, such as the RUNX3 developmental program; and non-cell autonomous processes,\nsuch as tumor microenvironment of metastasis (TMEM) windows, cooperate to drive and sustain the high\nmetastatic competency of PDA. The Runx3 developmental transcription factor coordinates a secretory program\nthat stimulates migration and invasion of cancer cells and preconditions the metastatic niche for successful\ndissemination of tumor cells. Therefore, our main goal is to focus on evaluating dissemination mechanisms and\ntherapeutic effects in mice with either low or high Runx3 expression.

project	1U01CA224348-01	1U01CA224348-01	9457862	2017	Reprogramming PDAC tumor microenvironment to improve immunotherapy	We have recently shown in preclinical studies using clinically relevant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma\n(PDAC) models that angiotensin system inhibitors (ASIs), including the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan,\ncan enhance the delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic agents by affecting the tumor microenvironment (PNAS\n2011, Nat Commun 2013). The mechanisms underlying this benefit include “normalization” of cancer-associated\nfibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in blood vessel decompression, improved perfusion, and\ndecreased hypoxia. These exciting preclinical findings formed the basis of an ongoing Phase II clinical trial at\nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which combines losartan with cytotoxic therapy – FOLFIRINOX and\nthen chemoradiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced PDAC (NCT01821729). An interim analysis of this\ntrial indicates that adding losartan to neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy doubles the frequency of conversion to\nresectable tumors (52%) and strikingly improves overall survival (OS) in these PDAC patients. Remarkably,\ntranscriptomic analysis of tumor biopsies from PDAC patients further indicates that ASI treatment not only\nnormalizes ECM-related phenotypes but also upregulates key pathways associated with anti-tumor immunity\ninvolving both adaptive (e.g., CD8+ T cells) and innate (e.g., dendritic cells (DCs)) immune components of the\nPDAC tumor microenvironment. Based on these preclinical and clinical findings, we hypothesize that ASIs in\ncombination with cytotoxic agents will reprogram the heterogeneous, pro-fibrotic, and immunosuppressive\nPDAC tumor microenvironment to one that is immunostimulatory. We further propose that combining ASIs\nand cytotoxic agents will enhance the delivery and efficacy of immunotherapies, which until now have had\nlimited or no benefit in PDAC patients. To test these hypotheses, we designed three Specific Aims: 1) Uncover\nhow losartan combined with cytotoxic agents alters tumor microenvironmental components (ECM, blood\nvessels, hypoxia) and immune cells, in locally advanced PDAC patients; 2) Dissect the causal role of drug-\ninduced adaptive and innate immune cells in the anti-tumor response in orthotopic (implanted and genetically\nengineered) PDAC models in mice; and 3) Evaluate whether combining ASI-induced tumor microenvironment\nreprogramming along with cytotoxic therapies enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockers. Based on\nour preclinical and clinical data, our tightly integrated and multidisciplinary team of investigators, and our\nbench-to-bedside-and-back research approach, we anticipate that successful completion of these studies will\npositively impact the development of new treatments for locally advanced PDAC patients who currently have\na 5-year survival rate of ~11%. Moreover, because we will actively participate in the PDAC Consortium, the\nknowledge gained in these studies will be available for other studies of the immune tumor microenvironment\nin PDAC that are undertaken within the Consortium. Through this work, we will develop innovative\napproaches to enhance anti-tumor immunity in this intractable disease.

Nonclassical\nmonocytes function in circulation to aid in removing pathogens and debris from the vasculature. We recently\nfound that nonclassical monocytes function in the vasculature to prevent tumor metastasis by orchestrating\nthe killing and clearance of metastasizing tumor cells. The anti-tumor immune potential of nonclassical\npatrolling monocytes is in contrast to the growing evidence for pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic functions\nof myeloid cells in many tumor types. In the current proposal, we hypothesize that nonclassical monocytes\nfunction in an anti-tumoral manner to support CAR T cell expansion and efficacy in patients with solid\ntumors. Thus, one major goal of our proposal is to determine whether monocyte therapy using anti-tumoral\nnonclassical monocytes in combination with existing CAR T immunotherapy would improve efficacy. We will\nuse mass cytometry to study monocyte subsets in cancer patients to identify new markers that will help\nreadily determine how successful a proposed immunotherapy may be for patients. Aim 1 will identify unique\nmarkers of nonclassical monocytes in multiply relapsed sarcoma patients versus healthy subjects using\nmass cytometry. Aim 1 will be performed using banked samples from the existing GD2 CAR T trial at the\nNIH Clinical Center. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that nonclassical monocytes play a functional role in\npromoting anti-tumor immunity when used in combination with immunotherapy for solid tumor metastasis.\nAim 2 will use both xenografted humanized mouse and syngeneic mouse tumor models. Aim 3 will study\nthe safety and preliminary efficacy of CAR T cell immunotherapy in combination with nonclassical monocyte\ncell therapy for patients with multiple relapsed, metastatic or progressive pediatric solid tumors. In Aim 3, we\nwill initiate a second generation GD2 CAR T cell trial for multiply relapsed patients with osteosarcoma and\nneuroblastoma. Given the potential anti-tumor efficacy of patrolling monocytes we plan to initiate an early\nphase clinical trial delivering nonclassical monocytes alone and in combination with CAR T cell therapy as\npart of this trial. There are 3 investigators in this project: one extramural, one intramural at NCI, and one at\nthe NIH Clinical Center. From the results of this proposal, we will achieve significant insight into the roles of\nvarious myeloid cell subpopulations on promoting and inhibiting the anti-tumoral responses of CAR T cell\ntherapies for solid tumors. We are uniquely poised as a research team to directly address the role of\nmonocytes and other myeloid cells in interacting with CAR T cells in human patients. The findings of our\nresearch team will significantly advance the knowledge that will lead to effective CAR T cell therapy for solid\ntumors. As similar interactions of monocytes occur with T cells that are modulated by checkpoint inhibitor\ntrials, we anticipate that our findings will shed insight into monocyte:T cell interactions in the context of\ncheckpoint inhibition therapy.

LS SCLC has only a 20-25% 5-year overall survival and ultimately a strategy for improving\nlong-term outcome in SCLC needs to successfully target the population of cells within tumors destined to\nsurvive through standard therapy to inevitably give rise to recurrent disease. However, there is a considerable\ngap in understanding the specific mechanisms responsible for chemoradiation (chemoXRT) resistance in\nSCLC. Our project is unique among the current portfolio of SCLC funded programs in that we have focused on\nchemoXRT resistance to increase cure rates in LS SCLC. Recently, our work has suggested using patient-\nderived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC may be an important tool to elucidate these mechanisms of\nchemoresistance. This approach identified a strongly synergistic anti-SCLC interaction that led to an approved\nCTEP trial based on our preclinical data - (NCI #10070: PI Hann). Our parent U01 had three Specific Aims: (1)\nCharacterize natural history of response of experimental models of SCLC to chemoXRT in vivo. – where we\nproposed to determine response rates and recurrence natural histories from a panel of PDXs and available\nSCLC genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs); (2) Characterization of molecular underpinnings of\nSCLC chemoXRT resistance – where we proposed constructing gene regulatory networks and gene\nexpression profiles associated with chemoXRT resistance; and , (3) Pharmacologic and genetic validation of\ncandidate genes for SCLC chemoXRT resistance in vitro and in vivo – where we proposed to validate novel\ngene candidates for conferring chemoXRT resistance using pharmacologic and genetic approach with SCLC\nPDX-derived organoids and available SCLC GEMMs. In this revision proposal, we propose additional Specific\nAims that are highly complementary to the parent U01 objectives but are completely novel. SCLC has recently\nbeen stratified into four molecular subgroups. Currently, there are no GEMMs that reliably represent the\nSCLC-Y (or -YAP1) subtype and using our novel epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) GEMMs we propose\nto create a novel SCLC GEMM for the community. Using novel inducible Twist1 and SNAI1 mouse models we\nwill examine whether Twist1 (or SNAI1) can accelerate autochthonous SCLC tumor development and are\ncasual for chemoXRT resistance. Lastly, our revision proposal leverages a new technique, tumor barcoding\nwith barcode deep-sequencing (Tuba-seq), to overcome all of the barriers that limited the feasibility of using\nSCLC GEMMs for quantitative pharmacogenomic analysis. We will use Tuba-seq, an innovative technique\nenabling lineage tracing and direct quantification of chemoXRT treatment effects on different genetic\nbackgrounds in vivo to profile the pharmcogenetic landscape of SCLC.

project	1U01CA232361-01A1	1U01CA232361-01A1	9839146	2019	Defining and overcoming intrinsic T cell dysfunction to enable pediatric immunotherapy	Project Summary and Abstract\nImmune therapy for cancer has risen to prominence by successfully overcoming chemotherapy\nresistance. One of the most successful therapies is chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR) that\ntarget the CD19 protein on the surface of leukemia. Landmark clinical trials led by our group\ndemonstrated unparalleled efficacy in relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n(ALL), with complete remission rates in excess of 80%, resulting in the first ever FDA approval\nof a gene modified cell therapy (Kymriah, tisagenlecleucel). There is a great need to develop\nCAR therapies for other pediatric cancers, and we face many challenges to achieve the same\nlevel of success in solid tumors and lymphoma.\nPrimary among these challenges is the difficulty in collecting healthy T cells from pediatric\ncancer patients. Our experience not only treating the most children in the world with CAR\ntherapy but also getting the most referrals gave us insight into the difficulty of getting healthy T\ncells from children with cancer. We have identified two main problems: dysfunction in T cells\nfrom children with solid tumors present at diagnosis and progressive difficulty getting functional\nT cells after intensive chemotherapy. As we have investigated these problems, we learned how\nfortunate we were with pediatric ALL, a patient group that has proven to have T cells uniquely\nwell preserved for CAR therapy generation.\nThis project seeks to identify the mechanisms of dysfunction in T cells from pediatric cancer\npatients both before and after chemotherapy, and reverse them to enable the generation of\nhighly active CAR T cell therapies for cancers other than ALL. Our preliminary data indicates\nthat Naïve T cells are the key starting material for successful CAR T cell generation in\npediatrics, and that in their absence preserving Naïve-like function during CAR manufacture can\nsubstitute. Metabolic pathways are key in the transitions from Naïve to memory and effector\nstates, and these feed into the energy reserve of a T cell as measured by its mitochondrial\npotential. Our research plan centers on manipulating metabolic pathways and restoring\nmitochondrial respiratory capacity to T cells from pediatric cancer patients.

These studies have broad relevance for pediatric leukemias given dependencies of numerous\nAML and ALL subtypes upon critical oncogenic cytokine receptor signaling pathways and the demonstrated\nclinical efficacy of cellular immunotherapies in children with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. In this proposal, we aim\nto develop combinatorial CAR approaches targeting (1) the TSLP receptor plus CD19 and/or CD22 to improve\nremission induction and longevity in Ph-like B-ALL, (2) the FLT3 receptor plus CD19 and/or CD22 to improve\nremission induction and longevity in KMT2A-rearranged B-ALL, and (3) the FLT3 receptor and CD33 to\nimprove remission induction and longevity in FLT3-mutant AML. The overall goal of these studies is to identify\nsuccessful combinatorial immunotherapeutic approaches to mitigate now-known resistance mechanisms of\nkinase signaling and antigen escape that are imminently translatable to the clinic for early-phase testing in\nchildren with high-risk acute leukemias.

Mounting evidence has shown that immunotherapies through\nstrengthening the amplitude and quality of T cell-mediated adaptive response may mediate durable and even\ncomplete tumor regression in some cancer patients. Two of the most promising approaches to enhance thera-\npeutic anti-tumor immunity are immune checkpoint blockade using monoclonal antibodies against PD-1/PD-L1\nand CTLA-4, and adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) or peripheral T cells that\nare genetically engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). However, functional and effective effector\nT cells require metabolically rewiring T cells to meet their anabolic and energy demands. A critical barrier for\nimmunotherapy is the hostile metabolic microenvironment within solid tumors, where the highly metabolic-\ndemanding tumor cells compromise the function of T cells by competing for glucose. In addition, tumor cells\nalso release immune suppressive metabolite, adenosine into the extracellular space. While recent advances\nhave helped determine the metabolic reprogramming of T cell activation and its regulatory signaling mecha-\nnism, the detailed landscape of metabolic programs in active T cells and the impact of the tumor’s metabolic\nmicroenvironment on the development and anti-tumor immune function of cytotoxic T effector (Teff) cells re-\nmains elusive. Our studies have shown that glucose restriction significantly dampened the growth and tumor-\nkilling activities of Teff cells. We further identified inosine as a potent metabolite that could replace glucose in\npromoting Teff cells growth and tumor-killing activities. Using inosine as the alterative metabolic substrate indi-\ncates a layer of metabolic plasticity on T cells and further implicates the potential of inosine in relieving tumor-\nimposed metabolic restrictions on T cells in vivo. However, stressed or damaged tumor cells release adeno-\nsine, an immediate metabolic precursor of inosine into the extracellular space to suppress Teff cells, shaping\nthe efficacy and magnitude of anti-tumor immune response. Hence, we hypothesize that reprogramming of\nthe adenosine-inosine metabolic axis can maximize anti-tumor immune response in treating pediatric\nsolid tumors. To test our hypothesis, we propose to 1) decipher inosine catabolic pathways and to assess the\nimpact of key metabolic steps on Teff cells; 2) develop and test inosine modulation strategies to enhance im-\nmunotherapy; and 3) develop strategies to reprogram tumor metabolic microenvironment and maximize sys-\ntemic anti-tumor immunity We propose taking the first step in testing the metabolic modulation of Teff cells to\nrelieve the metabolic barriers imposed by the tumor’s microenvironment. Our studies will have profound effects\non the field of cancer immunotherapy and substantially improve clinical outcomes of pediatric cancer patients.\nThe insights generated from this study will reveal fundamental principles of the emerging connections between\nthe tumor’s microenvironment, cell metabolism, and anti-tumor immunity.

Bridging of this gap could lead to novel immunotherapies. Our long-term goals are to develop novel\nimmunotherapies for leukemia and pediatric solid tumors. Our objective in this application is to investigate the\nrole of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing Stimulation-2 (ST2), the IL-33 receptor in the\nmicroenvironment as well as ST2 on tumoral cells. Our central hypothesis is that we can target the tumoral\nmicroenvironment and tumoral cells by blocking the IL-33/ST2 pathway with neutralizing and bispecific\nantibodies that we will develop. This hypothesis was formed based on our unpublished preliminary data\nshowing that: First, nonmalignant mice deficient in T-bet have elevated numbers of BM-infiltrating ST2+ Tregs\ncompared to wild-type (WT) mice (45% vs 25%, respectively), suggesting reciprocal roles of ST2/IL33 and T-\nbet/interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in Tregs from the BM niche. Second, we observed 10-fold more Tregs expressing\nsignificantly more activation markers in the BM niche of AML-bearing mice than in the nonmalignant niche.\nThird, MLL-AF9 AML cell proliferation was significantly lower in mice receiving donor syngeneic ST2 knock-out\n(ST2-/-) T cells than in mice receiving donor syngeneic WT T cells (2% vs 17%, respectively). ST2 blockade\nalso decreased Treg activation (i.e., KLRG1) and increased type 1 signaling in CD8+ T cells as well as\ndecreased their exhaustion, suggesting restoration of an antitumoral response in ST2-/- mice. The rationale for\nthis study is that once we are able to understand the biology of the immunological microenvironment in the\nmalignant niche, we can propose personalized treatment plans to block the tolerogenic pathways. Similarly,\nunderstanding the biology responsible for the overexpression of ST2/IL-33 on the tumoral cell, will help target\nthis pathway. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Explore ST2 and IL-33 expression on\ntumoral cells and in the tumoral microenvironment from liquid and solid childhood cancers in human and mice;\n2) Examine whether ST2/IL-33 blockade can impact tumor immunity in the malignant BM niche and solid tumor\nmicroenvironment as a proof-of-principle of a novel antitumoral immunotherapy; and 3) Optimizing anti-ST2\nneutralizing antibodies against murine and human targets for translational purpose. This approach is innovative\nbecause, to our knowledge, the function of ST2+ Tregs in the malignant microenvironment, remains virtually\nunexplored. It will also provide biological insights into the nature of ST2+ Tregs and ST2+ tumoral cells in the\nmicroenvironment and determine whether their blockade can restore antitumoral activity and decrease tumoral\nproliferation via a dual mechanism. The proposed research is significant because novel antitumoral\nimmunotherapies that are more targeted and less toxic than classical chemotherapy/irradiation regimens are\nneeded.

These successes culminated in the recent FDA\napproval of bi-specific T-cell engagers and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-armed T-cells for B-cell acute\nlymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).

TFH cells are crucial for the formation of germinal centers and\nhumoral responses, and our new data show that TFH cells become the main producers of\nCXCL13 and TNFS14/LIGHT upon vaccination. The assembly and maintenance of TLS should\nbe therefore dependent on TFH responses. Our new data demonstrate that Special AT-rich\nsequence-binding protein-1 (Satb1) ablation specifically in T cells leads to enhanced TFH\ndifferentiation and augmented Ag-specific humoral responses, which is associated with\nconcurrent ICOS and PD-1 de-repression. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that\nLIGHT+CXCL13+ TFH cell formation and, subsequently, the orchestration of TLS in cancer, is\ngoverned by Satb1 silencing in CD4 T cells by both de-repressing ICOS in TFH cells and\nsuppressing Foxp3+PD-1highCXCR5+ T follicular regulatory (TFR) cell formation through PD-1\nup-regulation. Therefore, TGF-β paradoxically enhances the generation of TFH cells and the\nformation of TLS through Satb1 repression.\n In Aim 1, we will define the role of SATB1-dependent ICOS expression during TFH\ndifferentiation. Through ChIP-PCR and functional analysis of Satb1-competent vs. Satb1-\ndeficient T cells in vivo, we will substantiate a novel epigenetic mechanism whereby the master\ngenomic organizer Satb1 governs ICOS expression, leading to enhanced TFH differentiation in\nthe absence of Satb1.\n In Aim 2, we will determine the role of SATB1 in TGF-β-driven, Treg-dependent TFH\ndifferentiation. Here, we will combine geentic manipulation and existing transgenic models to\nestablish to what extent the mechanism of TGF-β-driven TFH differentiation is Satb1- and PD-1-\ndependent, in a manner that requires decreased TFR formation.\n In Aim 3, we will recapitulate the mechanisms leading to the formation and protective activity\nof TLS in vivo in ovarian cancer. By leveraging unique transgenic models, our ovarian cancer-\nspecific CAR T cells and our viable single-cell suspensions from freshly dissociated ovarian\ncarcinomas, we will define a novel TGF-β → Satb1 silencing → TFH cell formation axis driving\nrelevant anti-tumor humoral responses.\n Our work will exert a profound effect in the field by elucidating how epigenetic programs\ncontrolled by SATB1 govern the generation of TFH cells at tumor beds in a TGF-β-dependent\nmanner. Recapitulating these mechanisms in vivo will pave the way for more effective\nimmunotherapies aimed to promote combined humoral and T cell responses through the\norchestration of TLS in irresectable/metastatic tumors, and could lead to the identification of\nantibodies with anti-tumor activity spontaneously produced at tumor beds.

Current practice guidelines from ACMG provide\nreferral indications for cancer predisposition assessment. Identifying patients with high genetic risk for breast,\novary, colon, or other cancers has important clinical ramifications for an individual's healthcare, but genetic risk\nif often not identified because of testing barriers at several levels. Barriers at the provider level include\ninadequacies in risk recognition, patient referrals and availability of genetic professionals to provide counseling\nin a traditional testing paradigm. Barriers at the level of the patient include poor understanding of the\navailability and benefits of testing and inadequate access to testing services. How to best implement\nappropriate genomic testing and follow-up care into an operating healthcare system is not known. Issues of\ncommunication, clinical flow, reportable actions, and transmission of information and support are of critical\nimportance, and must change and grow to accommodate the new information contained within genomic\ntesting. Studies to date of the implementation process have been conducted in high resourced facilities, under\noptimal conditions, often not at the system level. Aims include:\n1. Compare the efficacy and implementation of two strategies for identifying members of a primary care clinic's\npopulation who have a family or personal history of cancer and offering high-risk individuals to obtain genetic\ntesting for cancer susceptibility mutations in a randomized trial. The two methods are: 1) Point of Care (POC)\napproach: A tablet-based screening for family/personal history of cancer will be offered to all patients aged 25-\n65 coming in for a routine appointment at the clinic. 2) Direct Patient Engagement (DPE): Letters will be sent to\nall individuals aged 25-65 in a clinic's population, inviting them to visit a web site for screening for family\n/personal history of cancer. In both strategies, those determined to be high-risk will receive online education\nabout genetic testing and an invitation to obtain such testing through a web-based platform. Outcomes will be\nthe fraction of the active clinic patient population that completes screening and the fraction of the active clinic\npatient population that undergoes testing.\n2. Identify changes, problems, and inefficiencies in clinical flow and interactions during and after the\nimplementation of genomic testing for cancer risk across primary care clinics.\n3. Evaluate the effects of two methods of implementation of genomic screening for cancer risk on patient,\nprovider, and health system leader reports of benefits and harms, satisfaction, perceived quality of care,\nincluding across gender, racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and genetic literacy divides.\n4. Evaluate the value (cost-effectiveness) and affordability (budget impact) of each screening strategy.

Strategies to assess the genetic risk of unaffected individuals are needed. Scalable and\nsustainable methods to automatically extract and analyze family history information routinely captured in the\nelectronic health record (EHR) can identify primary care patients appropriate for cancer genetic services.\nIncreased patient ascertainment needs to be paired with implementation studies to compare models of\ndelivering genetic services, including patient-directed models. Because access to services continues to be a\nbarrier for those from minority racial and ethnic groups and rural areas, examining responses to different\ndelivery models across population subgroups is essential. This study will employ an implementation science\nframework to test a replicable EHR-based clinical decision support (CDS) infrastructure to: (i) automatically\nidentify unaffected patients from 48 primary care clinics in two healthcare systems, University of Utah and New\nYork University, who qualify for cancer genetic services (Aim 1); and (ii) compare two models of genetic\nservices delivery for 1,920 primary care patients using a randomized trial design with clinic-level randomization\n(Aims 2 and 3). We hypothesize that the CDS infrastructure will identify additional patients who have not been\npreviously referred (Aim 1) and that uptake of genetic testing (Aim 2) and adherence to management\nrecommendations (Aim 3) will be equivalent between the models. To address Aim 1, we will evaluate whether\nthe CDS approach identifies patients who have not previously been referred, and whether this varies by\nrace/ethnicity and rurality. To address Aim 2, we will compare: a patient-directed model in which those\nidentified by the CDS infrastructure as meeting testing criteria will be informed of their cancer risks, provided\nwith educational resources, and offered the option to select genetic testing through a patient portal to an\nenhanced standard of care model in which providers and patients are notified through CDS when criteria are\nmet and of the availability of standard of care genetic counseling. We will compare uptake of genetic testing by\nmodel and whether this differs by race/ethnicity and rurality. In Aim 3, we will compare the effects of the two\ndelivery models on adherence to recommendations 12 months after return of results, examining differences in\neffects by race/ethnicity and rurality.

The application is a proposed administrative supplement to the University of Utah (Utah)/New York\nUniversity (NYU) U01 entitled “Leveraging an electronic medical record infrastructure to identify primary care\npatients eligible for genetic testing for hereditary cancer and evaluate novel cancer genetics service delivery\nmodels” (U01 CA232826). The parent U01 is employing a replicable electronic health record (EHR)-based\nclinical decision support infrastructure to: (i) identify unaffected primary care patients who qualify for cancer\ngenetics services based on current guidelines in the Utah and NYU healthcare systems (Aim 1); and (ii)\ncompare two models of cancer genetics services delivery for 1,920 of these unaffected primary care patients in\na randomized controlled trial (Aims 2 and 3). The parent trial will examine how race and ethnicity modify the\neffects of the cancer genetics services delivery models. The landscape for delivering genetics services has\nchanged substantially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and our pilot data suggest that patients’ uptake of\ncancer genetic testing and access to cancer screening has been adversely affected. This supplement would\nprovide us with an unparalleled opportunity to investigate COVID-19 impacts in two study sites with very\ndifferent pandemic contexts. We propose the following Supplemental Aims: (1) Characterize healthcare\nexperiences related to COVID-19 among the cohort of 22,208 primary care patients identified as being at\nincreased risk for hereditary cancer; and (2) Investigate how COVID-19 impacts primary care patients’\ndecisions about and utilization of cancer genetics services. To address Supplemental Aim 1, we will abstract\nEHR data to investigate COVID-19 diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and delays in cancer screening in the\nidentified cohort. Among the subset of the cohort invited to participate in the trial, we hypothesize that having\nbeen diagnosed with or hospitalized for COVID-19 or having had a cancelled cancer screening will negatively\naffect trial participation. We will also investigate differences in these COVID-19 experiences by study site (Utah\nvs. NYU) and race/ethnicity. To address Supplemental Aim 2, among participants in the parent trial, we will\nexamine how the health, psychological, and financial impacts of COVID-19 affect decisions about and\nutilization of cancer genetic counseling and genetic testing using a combination of clinic records and\nquestionnaire data. Based on pilot data, we hypothesize that those having higher self-reported health,\npsychological, and financial impacts of COVID-19 will be less likely to complete cancer genetic testing. We will\nexamine how the effects of COVID-19 are modified by study site (Utah vs. NYU) and race/ethnicity. Together,\nthe supplemental aims will allow us to build a comprehensive picture of how COVID-19 has affected\nparticipation in and outcomes of the parent trial. The proposed supplement would also allow us to examine\nwhether COVID-19 is widening disparities in use of cancer genetics services by race and ethnicity.	2019-nCoV;Address;Adherence;Administrative Supplement;Affect;Affective;COVID-19;COVID-19 pandemic;Cancer Patient;Categories;Characteristics;Clinic;Clinical Informatics;Cognitive;Collection;Communication;Comprehension;Computerized Medical Record;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Distress;Effectiveness;Electronic Health Record;Ethnic Origin;Evaluation;Family;Family history of;Genetic Counseling;Genetic Models;Genetic Models for Cancer;Genetic Risk;Genetic Services;Guidelines;Health;Health Personnel;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm;Improve Access;Individual;Infrastructure;Inherited;Malignant Neoplasms;Minority Groups;Modeling;New York;Outcome;Parents;Participant;Patient Care;Patient Self-Report;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Population;Population Sciences;Predisposition;Primary Health Care;Provider;Questionnaires;Race;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Reaction;Recommendation;Recording of previous events;Records;Regrets;Resources;Screening for cancer;Service delivery model;Site;Subgroup;Testing;Translational Research;Uncertainty;Universities;Utah;base;cancer diagnosis;cancer genetics;cancer prevention;cancer risk;care providers;clinical care;clinical decision support;clinically significant;cohort;design;education resources;experience;genetic counselor;genetic risk assessment;genetic testing;hereditary risk;implementation science;innovation;interest;meetings;negative affect;novel;open source;pandemic disease;patient portal;patient response;population based;psychologic;racial and ethnic;randomized trial;response;risk perception;rural area;rurality;screening;service delivery;standard of care;tool;treatment strategy;trial design;uptake	UNIVERSITY OF UTAH	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	UNITED STATES	Ophira  Ginsburg,KIMBERLY A KAPHINGST	Nonniekaye F Shelburne	160971	160971	2020-09-10T04:00:00Z	2018-09-18T04:00:00Z	2023-08-31T04:00:00Z	PA-18-591

In individuals under age 40, cancer\nhas a distinct biology and often has an underlying genetic etiology. However, consensus guidelines driven by\nphenotypic characteristics fail to identify many young adult patients with inherited genetic risk, in part due to\ntheir complexity and to lack of data on mutation frequency. We likely vastly underestimate the frequency and\nspectrum of germline susceptibility in young adults with cancer, knowledge of which would have far-reaching\nimplications both for their treatment and follow-up care and for the diagnosis and management of relatives.\nThus, better strategies for diagnosing inherited risk among young adults with cancer are needed. Further,\ngenetic testing rates among relatives of those identified with inherited cancer risk range from 50-60%;\ninterventions to overcome the barriers that patients and relatives face, so they can take appropriate screening\nand risk-reducing measures, must be developed and tested. Finally, there is a critical need to integrate genetic\nevaluation and test results into the electronic medical record (EMR) to facilitate tailored clinical decision\nsupport for both clinicians and patients. The present proposal seeks to overcome the limitations of current data\nand models of care through two Specific Aims. First, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial among 1421\nyoung adults with cancer, one-third of whom will be members of racial or ethnic minorities or medically\nunderserved groups, to compare rates of ascertainment of genetic risk between guideline-driven, phenotype-\ndirected genetic testing (current standard of care) and universal cancer panel genetic testing. Working with the\nPenn Medicine Nudge Unit and Information Services, we will develop EMR-based algorithms for automatic\npatient referral and clinical decision support, driven by discrete genetic test results ported into the EMR via\nHL7, that will include ‘active choice’ nudges, direct-to-patient alerts, and physician dashboards that minimize\nphysician burden. We will compare adherence to screening recommendations among participants to that\namong historical controls. Second, we will compare the impact of the two up-front testing strategies among\npatients, enhanced by a novel strategy of direct team outreach to at-risk relatives, on ascertainment of genetic\nrisk among family members. We also will conduct qualitative interviews with a diverse sample of patients,\nrelatives, and family groups to describe the critical interactions that facilitate or impede communication about\nrisk and cascade testing within families and to explore the acceptability of direct clinical team outreach to at-\nrisk relatives. The proposed study promises to immediately alter national standards of care and payer policies\nby identifying the preferred approach to evaluating young adult cancer patients for genetic risk through a\nrigorous randomized trial, while measuring ascertainment among both patients and their relatives. In addition,\nbeyond its potential to change standards of care, the study will generate shareable EMR-based code,\nalgorithms, and models that will further enhance the sustainability of the proposed approach.

Symptom side effects such as nausea and diarrhea are\nparticularly common and impactful on the patient experience. However, historically this information has been\nreported by clinicians on behalf of their patients rather than by patients themselves – a process that has been\nshown to miss up to half of patients' symptoms. Therefore, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) supported\ndevelopment of the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse\nEvents (PRO-CTCAE), a library of questions to enable systematic patient self-reporting of side effect\ninformation. To date, the PRO-CTCAE questions have been developed and tested for validity and feasibility of\nuse in clinical trials – work that was led by the investigators on this proposal under contracts to the NCI.\nHowever, it is not yet established how best to combine PRO-CTCAE information with traditional measures of\ntreatment impact such as clinician-reported adverse events, time on treatment, drug dose levels, performance\nstatus, and hospitalizations. The purpose of this proposal is to advance understanding of the role of the PRO-\nCTCAE in combination with these traditional measures of treatment impact in assessments of drug tolerability.\nIn this proposal, advanced statistical methods will be used to analyze data from numerous clinical trials\naccessible to the team through the National Clinical Trial Network (cooperative groups) and industry. The\nspecific aims are to: 1) characterize relationships between the PRO-CTCAE and traditional measures of\ntreatment impact and tolerability; 2) test and standardize analytic techniques for the PRO-CTCAE; 3) refine\napproaches to analyzing missing PRO-CTCAE data; and 4) develop and refine tabular and graphical data\nvisualizations for longitudinal PRO-CTCAE data. To accomplish these aims, an exceptional multidisciplinary\nteam has been assembled including scientific, clinical, and patient investigators with extensive experience in\nacademic and industry clinical research, and longstanding expertise in patient-reported outcomes, adverse\nevents, biostatistics, psychometrics, clinical trial design/analysis, health disparities, and informatics.

project	1U01CA233074-01	1U01CA233074-01	9626083	2018	Targeting alternative splicing for TCR discovery in small cell carcinomas	ABSTRACT\n We present a collaborative immunotherapeutics discovery program that exploits alternative pre-mRNA\nsplicing as a source of cancer-specific epitopes for T-cell receptor (TCR) therapy of small cell carcinomas of\nthe prostate and lung. Small cell carcinomas arise from many different epithelial tissues but are generally\naggressive, have no curative treatment, and carry a dire prognosis. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most\ncommon subtype. Small cell prostate cancer (SCPC) is rare as a primary disease but is becoming increasingly\ncommon as a late-stage phenotypic transition in response to hormone-deprivation therapy. Emerging research\nindicates that despite their disparate tissues of origin, SCPC and SCLC are highly similar in behavior and\nmolecular phenotype. This suggests effective targeted therapies could address both malignancies.\n Our strategy is to define cancer-specific epitopes created by alternative pre-mRNA splicing in small cell\ncarcinomas and then use these targets to develop TCR-based therapeutics. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell\n(CAR-T) therapies targeting cell surface proteins have been developed for some hematological malignancies,\nbut this strategy has been unsuccessful for epithelial tumors. The limited cancer specificity of the target epitope\nhas led to significant on-target, off-tumor toxicities in human trials. We have chosen to pursue TCRs to expand\nthe pool of available targets beyond the cell surface. We hypothesize that tapping into the additional proteomic\ndiversity revealed by a detailed analysis of alternatively spliced exons will provide better targets.\n Our team of principal investigators includes experts in the computational biology of alternative splicing\n(Yi Xing), cancer cell biology and immunology (Owen Witte), and hematopoietic cell development and\nimmunology (Gay Crooks).

Small cell carcinomas arise from many different epithelial tissues but are generally\naggressive, have no curative treatment, and carry a dire prognosis.

All three\napproaches induce T cell mediated killing of cancer cells. However, widespread development of bi-specific\nantibodies and CAR T cells is limited by the small number of known cell-surface proteins that are sufficiently\nspecific to cancer to safely allow targeting by antibodies. This is particularly true for solid cancers, where unlike\nhematopoietic malignancies, loss of healthy cells cannot be readily replenished by stem cell progenitors. A\nsolution to this issue is to target cancer specific glycan antigens rather than protein antigens. Indeed, altered\nglycosylation is a near universal feature of cancer and represent the most abundant and widely expressed cell\nsurface cancer antigens, while also having limited or no expression in normal tissue. However, generation of\nmonoclonal antibodies specific to complex carbohydrates has proven to be very challenging, greatly limiting\ntheir usefulness as targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we propose to address these issues and\ndevelop a novel class of immunotherapeutics that target an N-linked carbohydrate antigen common to\nthe vast majority of solid and hematopoietic cancers. We have termed these molecules as Glycan-\ndependent T cell Recruiter (GlyTR) technology. Critically, GlyTR technology does not utilize antibodies to\ntarget carbohydrate cancer antigens. Preliminary data demonstrates that the GlyTR bi-specific protein 1)\nspecifically bound to both human CD3 and its N-glycan target, 2) robustly activated T cells only in the presence\nof cancer cells, 3) induced T cell dependent killing of cancer cells with an EC50 as low as 5pM, 4) inhibited in\nvivo growth of established colon cancer xenografts in humanized NSG mice and 5) did not trigger production of\nantibodies in mice. To further expand on this approach, the following Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will\ncharacterize human and mouse reactive GlyTR bi-specific proteins targeting N-glycans. Aim 2 will\nexamine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using humanized NSG mice.\nAim 3 will examine the efficacy and safety of GlyTR proteins targeting N-glycans using mice with a\nnormal immune system. If successful, these experiments will provide proof of principal data for an entire new\nclass of cancer killing immunotherapeutic's capable of targeting multiple solid and hematopoietic cancers with\nminimal toxicity.

A\nsolution to this issue is to target cancer specific glycan antigens rather than protein antigens. Indeed, altered\nglycosylation is a near universal feature of cancer and represent the most abundant and widely expressed cell\nsurface cancer antigens, while also having limited or no expression in normal tissue.

Preliminary data demonstrates that the GlyTR bi-specific protein 1)\nspecifically bound to both human CD3 and its N-glycan target, 2) robustly activated T cells only in the presence\nof cancer cells, 3) induced T cell dependent killing of cancer cells with an EC50 as low as 5pM, 4) inhibited in\nvivo growth of established colon cancer xenografts in humanized NSG mice and 5) did not trigger production of\nantibodies in mice.

All three\napproaches induce T cell mediated killing of cancer cells. However, widespread development of bi-specific\nantibodies and CAR T cells is limited by the small number of known cell-surface proteins that are sufficiently\nspecific to cancer to safely allow targeting by antibodies.

However, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has been limited by low response rates and limited durations\nof response in certain settings, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer\n(TNBC), as well as ovarian, prostate and colorectal cancers. These findings are explained, at least in part, by\nthe premise that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is only one of a number of tumor immune suppressive mechanisms that\nrequire inhibition.\n Therefore, additional strategies are clearly needed to improve the immunotherapy of human cancers. In\nthis respect, cancer cells activate a program of immune evasion involving, for example, induction of PD-L1\nexpression and the downregulation of effectors that promote innate and adaptive immune response. The\ndiscovery and targeting of such immune suppressive programs has had limited success to date, supporting a\ncritical need for identifying signaling pathways that activate these programs.\n The MUC1-C oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed in human carcinomas and is associated with poor\nclinical outcomes. MUC1-C promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the cancer stem cell\n(CSC) state. Recent advances have demonstrated that MUC1-C also activates a program of immune evasion\nin human cancer cells that includes upregulation of PD-L1 expression and the suppression of immune\neffectors, such as IFN. In addition, targeting MUC1-C has been found to effectively reverse tumor immune\nevasion.\n These findings have emphasized the need for developing agents that target MUC1-C for the\nimmunotherapy of human cancers. In this way, selective and potent antibodies generated against the MUC1-C\nextracellular domain are under development as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and for antibody-\ndependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, a peptide inhibitor of the MUC1-C cytoplasmic\ndomain has been developed in a nanoparticle formulation, based on the findings that this agent inhibits PD-L1\nexpression and activates anti-tumor T cells in the immune microenvironment.\n The MUC1-C-targeted agents will be studied in genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for\nanti-tumor activity, as well as effects on the immune microenvironment when used alone and in combination\nwith PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade. These studies will be integrated with assessment of MUC1-C expression in\nhuman tumors as a metric of the suppressive immune microenvironment. The overall goal will be to develop\nagents that target MUC1-C and are advanced to clinical evaluation as novel immunotherapeutics.

project	1U01CA233085-01A1	1U01CA233085-01A1	9869478	2019	Reprograming the tumor microenvironment to overcome multiple primary and acquired immune resistance mechanisms in ovarian cancer	The goal of our studies is to generate robust and long-lasting tumor-specific T cell responses for durable\ntumor regression in patients with chemotherapy-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Although\nimmunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive T cell therapy, or oncolytic viruses has generated\nremarkable results in several other tumor types, long-term tumor control has been infrequent in EOC patients.\nStudies by our group have identified key stumbling blocks underpinning the limited efficacy of immunotherapy\nin EOC, which include: (i) insufficient expansion of tumor-specific T cells, (ii) tumor-derived CXCL12 production\nthat recruits Tregs and MDSC within tumors, (iii) expression of PD1 and LAG3 marking severely dysfunctional\ntumor infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), (iv) compensatory upregulation of LAG3 upon blockade of PD1 and\nvice-versa, and (v) disorganized and tortuous tumor vasculature lacking adequate flow dynamics to support\ntrafficking of anti-tumor T cells. While combinatorial immunotherapy strategies have the potential to overcome\nthese immune resistance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME), they are often associated with\nunacceptably high rates of toxicities in patients. Our proposal addresses these stumbling blocks using\ninnovative, clinically-translatable strategies to reprogram the TME and to identify mechanisms that drive or\nhinder T cell trafficking into ovarian tumors.\n We previously demonstrated blockade of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in the ovarian TME by intraperitoneal\ndelivery of an oncolytic vaccinia virus expressing a CXCR4 antagonist (OV-CXCR4-Fc) reduced intratumoral\naccumulation of immunosuppressive mediators and stimulated spontaneous antitumor immunity to\nendogenous tumor antigens. OV-CXCR4-Fc also improved T cell trafficking. We will build on the multifaceted\nantitumor activity of OV-CXCR4-Fc by further “arming” with antagonists of PD1 and LAG3, the two co-inhibitory\nreceptors we have shown mark severely dysfunctional TILs in EOC patients. In addition, we plan to uncover\nthe molecular mechanisms by which OV-CXCR4-Fc enhances T cell migration and trafficking to overcome the\novarian tumor “vascular checkpoint”. We hypothesize that in vivo tumor destruction by OV engineered to\nexpress the CXCR4 antagonist and PD1/LAG3 inhibitors (OV-CXCR4-Fc-PD1/LAG3) will limit dampening of\nthe immune response in the TME and induce a molecular signature that promotes trafficking and homing of\ntumor-specific T cells. To test our hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims:\n Aim 1. Determine the therapeutic synergy of arming OV-CXCR4-Fc with PD1/LAG3 inhibitors.\n Aim 2. Determine the mechanism by which OV-CXCR4-Fc promotes T cell trafficking in murine and human\n ovarian tumors.\n Aim 3.

However, despite their potential to produce dramatic\ntreatment responses, ICI have proven to be ineffective for most patients and tumor types. Consequently, there\nremains a need for new immunotherapies that are effective in patients who are resistant or non-responsive to\ncurrent ICI. To this end, immune cytokines have potent immunostimulatory activities that make them attractive\npotential therapeutics. Compared to the effect of ICI to “tune” existing immune responses, cytokines can tap into\npowerful programs that can effectively “reprogram” immune cells and control their activation, differentiation, and\nproliferation. Among cytokines, Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is an appealing immunotherapeutic candidate given its\nability to stimulate both adaptive and innate immunity through CD8+ T and NK cells, respectively. However, the\nactivity of IL-18 is limited by an endogenous decoy receptor, IL-18BP, which is induced as part of a negative\nfeedback loop by interferon gamma activity, reminiscient of the regulation of the PD-1:PD-L1 axis and suggesting\nthat it may represent a “soluble immune checkpoint” in cancer. Using directed evolution, the Ring lab has created\nan engineered version of IL-18 that is fully capable of activating the IL-18 receptor, but impervious to inhibition\nby IL-18BP. This decoy resistant IL-18 (DR-18) is active as a mono-immunotherapy in preclinical mouse models,\nwhere it can induce complete and durable tumor regressions. DR-18 also synergizes with ICI (anti-PD-1) therapy\nand is associated with high cure rates and limited toxicity in this setting. Notably, DR-18 is also effective for the\ntreatment of MHC class I deficient murine tumors, which are resistant to ICI treatment, consistent with the ability\nof IL-18 to also activate anti-tumor activity of NK cells. In order to better understand the mechanism of DR-18\nimmunotherapy and enable its translation into the clinic, we propose to leverage a comprehensive series of\nsophisticated, genetically-defined syngeneic mouse models of melanoma called YUMM and YUMMER that we\nhave developed. We propose to more comprehensively evaluate our hypothesis that bypass of the IL-18BP\ncheckpoint by DR-18 will enable responses in ICI-resistant tumors in two Aims: 1) Evaluation and optimization\nof DR-18 therapy in melanoma, and 2) Development of DR-18 for the treatment of ICI-resistant tumors. We will\nutilize techniques including single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitiative pathology to better characterize DR-18\nresponses in the tumor microenvironment over time. Results from murine experiments will be functionally\nvalidated in fresh, dissociated human melanoma specimens. We aim to begin clinical trials with human DR-18\nin 2020; these aims are focused on understanding and optimizing DR-18 in anticipation of this work.

However, the therapeutic potential of the immune system in eliminating premalignant cells\nand preventing their progression to invasive cancers is unclear. To determine the benefit of activating the\nimmune system to prevent cancer development and recurrence, we study the immune pathways that lead to\neffective immune activation against early phases of breast cancer development. Breast cancer is the most\ncommon internal cancer and second cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. Importantly,\nthe individuals at high risk of developing breast cancer due to underlying genetic mutations and those with\npremalignant lesions can be clinically identified and treated. Therefore, discovering an effective approach to\nactivate the patients' own immune system against early breast precursor lesions may yield a lasting memory\nthat can prevent breast cancer development and recurrence in this high-risk population. Our previous studies\nhave demonstrated that a skin-derived immune factor called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) suppresses\nthe early stages of skin and breast cancer development. We have been able to extend these finding to clinics\nthrough a randomized double-blind clinical trial in which we find TSLP induction to promote a robust immune\nactivation against skin cancer precursors and their complete clearance. In order to determine the precise\nmechanism of TSLP-induced immune response against early premalignant cells in the breast, and to extend\nour findings to other similar immune factors in high-risk patients, we aim to (1) determine the immune cells and\nsignals that target breast premalignant cells in response to TSLP, (2) investigate the role of other immune\nfactors released by breast cells that can induce immune response to block breast cancer development, and (3)\ndetermine the factors that are driving the immune response in the breast glands of patients with genetic\nmutations and utilize them for induction of an optimal immune response against early breast cancer.

Advances in immunotherapy with drugs\ntargeting immune checkpoints have raised hopes that these agents will improve outcomes for mCRPC\npatients. While initial studies of immune checkpoint blockade have been unsuccessful, emerging evidence\nsuggests a subset of prostate cancer (PCa) patients can respond, although the mechanisms of PCa\nimmunotherapy response and resistance are incompletely characterized. Work in other immunotherapy\nresponsive malignancies has found several predictive immune and tumor-intrinsic properties that contribute to\nresponse, but the extent to which these (or other) features are operant in PCa is largely unknown. For\nexample, we recently identified mutations in a chromatin remodeling complex that mediates immunotherapy\nresponse through T cell interactions in solid tumors, and in parallel discovered a previously unknown PCa\ngenomic subclass defined by mutations in these same chromatin remodelers. These findings indicate that\ntumor-intrinsic epigenetic dysregulation may also interact with the immune system to modulate PCa\nimmunotherapy responsiveness. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that multiple immune and tumor-\nintrinsic properties mediate PCa interactions with the immune system, and these interactions can be modified\nthrough selective targeting in combination with checkpoint blockade to expand the therapeutic potential of\nimmunotherapy in PCa. We will leverage our team's deep experience in clinically grounded molecular\ncharacterization and preclinical models that can test immunotherapy combinations in PCa to define the\nprocesses that govern the immunotherapy landscape in PCa. The proposed specific aims are: 1) Define the\nsystemic and infiltrating immune states in PCa associated with clinical response to checkpoint blockade; 2)\nEstablish the immunologic impact of chromatin dysregulation and inhibition in PCa; and 3) Determine the\nimpact of existing DNA damaging agents for sensitizing PCa to PD-1 blockade. This proposal leverages the\nextensive, novel, and complementary resources at both Dana-Farber/Broad Institute and University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, led by highly collaborative investigators and an international scientific team, to\naddress the hypotheses outlined herein. Through a combination of functional, molecular, and clinical\napproaches inherent in these studies, our team is poised to identify mCRPC cohorts that may benefit from this\ntreatment paradigm, determine strategies to augment the use of checkpoint inhibitors in this disease, and\nmechanistically define the immune and tumor-intrinsic defects that drive immunoresistance in PCa. Broadly,\nthis project will provide a unique approach for the Immuno-Oncology Translation Network (IOTN) community\nand enable discovery of anti-cancer immunotherapies strategies for PCa that may have larger relevance\nacross the IOTN network and collaborating members of the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.

Advances in immunotherapy with drugs\ntargeting immune checkpoints have raised hopes that these agents will improve outcomes for mCRPC\npatients. While initial studies of immune checkpoint blockade have been unsuccessful, emerging evidence\nsuggests a subset of prostate cancer (PCa) patients can respond, although the mechanisms of PCa\nimmunotherapy response and resistance are incompletely characterized. Work in other immunotherapy\nresponsive malignancies has found several predictive immune and tumor-intrinsic properties that contribute to\nresponse, but the extent to which these (or other) features are operant in PCa is largely unknown. For\nexample, we recently identified mutations in a chromatin remodeling complex that mediates immunotherapy\nresponse through T cell interactions in solid tumors, and in parallel discovered a previously unknown PCa\ngenomic subclass defined by mutations in these same chromatin remodelers. These findings indicate that\ntumor-intrinsic epigenetic dysregulation may also interact with the immune system to modulate PCa\nimmunotherapy responsiveness. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that multiple immune and tumor-\nintrinsic properties mediate PCa interactions with the immune system, and these interactions can be modified\nthrough selective targeting in combination with checkpoint blockade to expand the therapeutic potential of\nimmunotherapy in PCa. We will leverage our team's deep experience in clinically grounded molecular\ncharacterization and preclinical models that can test immunotherapy combinations in PCa to define the\nprocesses that govern the immunotherapy landscape in PCa. The proposed specific aims are: 1) Define the\nsystemic and infiltrating immune states in PCa associated with clinical response to checkpoint blockade; 2)\nEstablish the immunologic impact of chromatin dysregulation and inhibition in PCa; and 3) Determine the\nimpact of existing DNA damaging agents for sensitizing PCa to PD-1 blockade. This proposal leverages the\nextensive, novel, and complementary resources at both Dana-Farber/Broad Institute and University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco, led by highly collaborative investigators and an international scientific team, to\naddress the hypotheses outlined herein.

Using an “in situ vaccine”\nregimen consisting of 12 Gy focal external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and intratumoral (IT) injection of\ntumor-specific antibody (mAb) + IL2, we have eradicated solitary, large, cold syngeneic tumors in mice. This in\nsitu vaccine converts the targeted tumor into a focus of enhanced tumor antigen presentation resulting in\nincreased T-cell infiltration and potent T-cell memory. However, the presence of an identical but untreated\nsecond tumor (2°) on a mouse’s opposite flank inhibits the effect of this treatment, preventing eradication of the\nprimary (1°) tumor treated with EBRT + IT mAb-IL2. In this setting, the untreated 2° tumor causes tumor-\nspecific immune unresponsiveness to EBRT + IT mAb-IL2 at the 1° tumor. We refer to this as concomitant\nimmune tolerance (CIT). We can overcome CIT, and eliminate both tumors by giving IT mAb-IL2 to the 1°\ntumor and EBRT to both the 1° and 2° tumors. Delivering as little as 2 Gy EBRT to the 2° tumor can overcome\nCIT. Clinically, delivery of EBRT (even low dose) to all sites of metastatic disease is problematic, but this can\neffectively be achieved using molecular targeted radiation therapy (MTRT). MTRT is increasingly entering\nclinical oncology practice and our UW team has led preclinical and clinical testing of a novel class of MTRT\nusing alkylphosphocholine (APCh) analogs that selectively deliver radiation to cancers in vivo. These show\ntumor-selective uptake in virtually all mammalian tumor cells and tumor locations tested (including > 90 tumor\nlines and in patients across various clinical trials). In a syngeneic murine melanoma model, we have observed\na potent synergy between systemically administered ICI and MTRT delivered using our next-generation APC\nanalog, 90Y-NM600. In a project that builds upon the ongoing collaborative progress of our multidisciplinary\nteam, we will now systematically optimize the potency of combining MTRT with immunotherapy to enhance\nthe immune response against immunologically cold tumors. In murine models, we will: 1) expand on\npreliminary data showing potent synergy with the combination of MTRT and ICI, 2) evaluate the capacity of\nMTRT to overcome CIT and enhance systemic anti-tumor immune response in the setting of multiple tumors\nwhere one is treated with in situ vaccine (EBRT + IT mAb-IL2) alone or in combination with ICI. Because\nmurine models do not replicate the size and spatial distribution of human metastatic cancer and because these\nfactors strongly influence the dosimetry of MTRT, we will test the immunomodulatory effects of MTRT + in situ\nvaccine in large breed companion canines (pet dogs) with naturally occurring metastatic melanoma. The\ninsights and treatment regimens developed in these studies should enable rapid translation to clinical\ntesting in patients and potentially for any type of metastatic cancer.	90Y;Address;Anatomy;Animals;Antibodies;Antigen Presentation;Biology;Cancer Model;Canis familiaris;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Companions;Data;Disease;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Distant;Dose;Epitope spreading;External Beam Radiation Therapy;Generations;Goals;Half-Life;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Human;IL2 gene;Image;Immune;Immune Evasion;Immune Tolerance;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immunocompetent;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Infiltration;Injections;Intravenous;Isotopes;Length;Location;Low Dose Radiation;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metastatic Melanoma;Modality;Modeling;Molecular Target;Monoclonal Antibodies;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Mus;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Preclinical Testing;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radioisotopes;Regimen;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Safety;Site;Soft tissue sarcoma;Spatial Distribution;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Targeted Radiotherapy;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Translations;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Immunity;Ursidae Family;Vaccination;Vaccines;Veins;Vision;Work;analog;anti-tumor immune response;cancer site;checkpoint inhibition;dosimetry;efficacy testing;immunogenic;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;insight;mRNA Expression;melanoma;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoantigens;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;novel strategies;pre-clinical;prevent;protein expression;radiation effect;research clinical testing;response;sarcoma;synergism;systemic toxicity;treatment effect;tumor;tumor eradication;tumor microenvironment;uptake;virtual	UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON	MADISON	WI	UNITED STATES	Zachary Scott Morris,JAMEY P WEICHERT	Mansoor M Ahmed	765000	765000	2018-09-18T04:00:00Z	2018-09-18T04:00:00Z	2023-08-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-17-045

The\ninsights and treatment regimens developed in these studies should enable rapid translation to clinical\ntesting in patients and potentially for any type of metastatic cancer.	90Y;Address;Anatomy;Animals;Antibodies;Antigen Presentation;Biology;Cancer Model;Canis familiaris;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Companions;Data;Disease;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Distant;Dose;Epitope spreading;External Beam Radiation Therapy;Generations;Goals;Half-Life;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Human;IL2 gene;Image;Immune;Immune Evasion;Immune Tolerance;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immunocompetent;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Injections;Intravenous;Isotopes;Length;Location;Low Dose Radiation;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metastatic Melanoma;Modality;Modeling;Molecular Target;Monoclonal Antibodies;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Mus;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Preclinical Testing;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radioisotopes;Regimen;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Safety;Site;Soft tissue sarcoma;Spatial Distribution;Stimulator of Interferon Genes;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Targeted Radiotherapy;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapy trial;Translations;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Immunity;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Ursidae Family;Veins;Vision;Work;analog;anti-tumor immune response;cancer site;checkpoint inhibition;dosimetry;efficacy testing;immunogenic;immunoregulation;improved;in situ vaccination;in situ vaccine;in vivo;insight;mRNA Expression;melanoma;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neoantigens;neoplastic cell;next generation;novel;novel strategies;pre-clinical;prevent;protein expression;radiation delivery;radiation effect;research clinical testing;response;sarcoma;synergism;systemic toxicity;treatment effect;tumor;tumor eradication;tumor microenvironment;uptake;virtual	UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON	MADISON	WI	UNITED STATES	Zachary Scott Morris,JAMEY P WEICHERT	Mansoor M Ahmed	765000	765000	2021-08-26T04:00:00Z	2018-09-18T04:00:00Z	2023-08-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-17-045

The growing population of older patients\nremains underrepresented in research that sets cancer care standards leading to significant disparities in\noutcomes. In our preliminary research, we found that: 1) close to 60% of older patients develop grade 3-5\ntoxicity (as measured by NCI's CTCAE) within three months of starting a new treatment regimen; items from\ngeriatric assessment (GA) were significantly associated with toxicity; 2) older patients with advanced cancer\nfrequently experience multiple symptoms that interfere with function and quality of life (QoL); and 3) older\npatients often experience toxicities that lead to early discontinuation of treatment, hospitalizations, and\nmortality. We have an unprecedented opportunity to leverage an existing multi-site cluster randomized study\nthat is currently enrolling adults aged >70 years with age-related conditions who are starting a new treatment\nregimen for advanced cancer in the UR NCORP network (URCC 13059/“GAP”) (n=700). In addition to\nclinician-rated CTCAE, GAP captures PRO measures (PRO-CTCAE, GA, satisfaction) at baseline, 4 weeks, 3\nmonths, and 6 months after the start of the new treatment regimen. Extensive data are collected on clinical\ntolerability metrics including treatment dose modifications, hospitalizations, and mortality. We will collaborate\nwith the U01 consortium to: 1) develop and compare the trajectories of PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated\nCTCAE grades 2-5 in older patients with age-related conditions; 2) evaluate associations between PRO-\nCTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with clinical tolerability metrics; 3) evaluate associations\nbetween PRO-CTCAE scores and clinician-rated CTCAE grades with PRO endpoints (e.g., function, QoL,\nsatisfaction); and 4) validate a model that identifies older patients with age-related conditions who are at high\nrisk for poor tolerability from treatment for advanced cancer. Developed with stakeholders, our operational\ndefinition of tolerability is novel; it includes both clinical outcomes and PRO endpoints. The team, which\nincludes expertise in clinical trials (Mohile, Morrow, Janelsins, Kamen), biostatistics and data science\n(Culakova, Heckler, Pandya, Ramsdale, Zand), PRO measurement (Mohile, Duberstein, Chapman, Flannery),\nand collaborations with CARG (Hurria, Dale) and patient advocates (SCOREBoard led by Canin) is uniquely\nsuited to conduct this research. This research will address a critical gap in knowledge of how patient-reported\ntoxicity informs tolerability of treatment in older patients with advanced cancer and age-related conditions.

The overarching goal of this one-year supplement grant proposal is: to evaluate whether sarcopenia\nis associated with tolerability of treatment for advanced cancer in older patients with age-related\nconditions. The growing population of older patients remains underrepresented in research that sets cancer\ncare standards leading to significant disparities in outcomes. In our preliminary research, we found that: 1)\nclose to 60% of older patients develop grade 3-5 toxicity (as measured by NCI's clinician-rated Common\nTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CR-CTCAE]); impairment in geriatric assessment (GA) domains were\nsignificantly associated with toxicity; 2) 29% of older adults with cancer received chemotherapy at significantly\nreduced relative dose intensity (RDI); and 3) sarcopenia is highly prevalent (58%) in the geriatric oncology\npopulation. U01CA233167 funds secondary analyses of a completed clinical trial to understand how toxicities\ninform treatment tolerability as part of a NCI U01 tolerability consortium. The operational definition of tolerability\nwe proposed in the U01 is novel because it includes not only adverse outcomes such as toxicity, but also\npatient-reported outcomes (PROs) valued by older patients. Our analyses utilize data from a completed\nrandomized trial, the GAP study (URCC 13059, clinicaltrials.gov NCT02054741), which evaluated whether\nprovision of a GA summary to oncologists would improve clinical outcomes in adults aged 70+ with advanced\ncancer receiving treatment (i.e., chemotherapy or other drugs with high risk of toxicity). In this U01 supplement\nproposal, we will evaluate whether muscle mass (determined by Computed Tomography [CT] scan body\ncomposition analysis) is independently associated with treatment tolerability. Our tolerability endpoints include\nnot only toxicity, but also dose intensity, survival, and PROs. Only patients in usual care enrolled to GAP will\nbe included for these analyses (n=369), because many in the intervention group had initial treatment dosages\naltered based on the GA summary. We will collaborate with Voronoi Health Analytics to accurately measure\nskeletal muscle mass via CT scan body composition analysis: 1) to determine if sarcopenia is associated with\nan increased prevalence of grade 3-5 toxicity (CR-CTCAE v4); 2) to determine if sarcopenia is associated with\ncancer treatment RDI; and 3) to determine if sarcopenia is associated with mortality. Exploratory aims will\nevaluate if change in muscle mass is associated with clinical outcomes and patient-reported adverse events\n(as measured by PRO-CTCAE). The team, which includes expertise in clinical trials (Mohile, Mustian, Hezel,\nLinehan), sarcopenia (Dunne, Hezel, Linehan, Voronoi Health Analytics), geriatric oncology (Mohile and Loh),\nbiostatistics and data science (Culakova, Xu), and PRO measurement (Mohile, Culakova, Loh) is uniquely\nsuited to conduct this research. This research will address a critical gap in knowledge of sarcopenia and its\nrelationship with tolerability of treatment in older patients with advanced cancer and age-related conditions.

This has\nled to a resurgence of interest in immune-based approaches. While augmenting immunity has been successful\nin other malignancies like melanoma and leukemia/lymphoma, their efficacy in treatment of brain tumors has\nbeen very limited. Tumor antigen heterogeneity, limited number of infiltrating lymphocytes at the tumor site,\nand failure of checkpoint inhibitor drugs to cross the blood brain barrier all represent major obstacles to\neffective immune-therapies in GBM. Altered immunity in patients with GBM further contributes to the poor\nprognoses of these tumors and their relative resistance to vaccine and checkpoint inhibitors. Utilizing healthy\ndonor immune cells in the form of adoptive cell therapy may offer a more effective alternative. However, limited\ninformation is available on the properties of effector populations that would exert effective anti-tumor activity in\nthe brain. Pioneering work by Dr. Rick Jones at Johns Hopkins University utilizing haploidentical donor\ntransplant (haplo-BMT) for brain tumors offers an opportunity to test kinetics of infused healthy donor immune\ncells in this patient population, providing a glimpse of what donor immune cells can do against brain tumors.\nPrevious experiences with haplo-BMT suggest that effector cells of the innate immunity – natural killer cells\n(NKs) and invariant natural killer T cells (iNKTs) – mediate anti-tumor activity with decreased frequency of\nrelapse. Innate immune cells are also potentially advantageous in the brain tumor setting, which affords very\nlittle tolerance for the adverse events associated with (for example) CD19-CAR T cell based-therapies. Finally,\nboth iNKT and NK cells can actively migrate to the site of GBM following the CCL2 gradient, the chemokine\nreleased by tumor cells and the surrounding tumor associated macrophages (TAM). Dr. Savoldo at\nUniversity of North Carolina has unique expertise in the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)\ntransduced T cells and iNKT cells and Dr. Bollard at Children's National has extensive experience with the\ngenetically modified T cells and NK cells. Hence, in this collaborative proposal we hypothesize that\nnontolerized innate immune cells (NKs and iNKTs) derived from healthy donors will promote anti-\ntumor immunity in patients GBM, and may be developed as effective cellular therapies. This overarching\nhypothesis will be tested in 3 Specific Aims where Dr. Jones (Aim 1) will compare the cellular signatures of\niNKTs and NK cells isolated from healthy donors versus patients with GBM. In Aim 2, Dr. Savoldo and the\nUNC team will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of healthy donor iNKT and NK cells modified to express an anti-\nB7H3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and in Aim 3, Drs.

Clinical studies show that autologous stem cell\ntransplantation (ASCT) remains an efficacious consolidation treatment for eligible patients and a subset of\ntransplant recipients achieve long-term control of disease. Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced\nby ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates\ninflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the\npotential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. We have recently utilized novel preclinical models to provide\ndefinitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific T cell immunity and the re-establishment of a state of\nimmune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these systems\nis a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive populations\nand the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. These inhibitory pathways are highly\namenable to immunotherapeutic approaches after ASCT that invoke long term survival. This proposal will utilize\nsophisticated protein and transcriptional based approaches to examine the relationship of T cell function in the\nperi-transplant period to subsequent survival and disease control in well-annotated clinical cohorts. A major focus\nwill be the optimization of innovative immunotherapy approaches after ASCT in preclinical systems for clinical\ntranslation.

Currently, the prolongation of plateau-phase induced\nby ASCT is attributed to the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and cytoreduction. However, ASCT generates\ninflammation and profound lymphodepletion, whilst disrupting the marrow microenvironment, all of which has the\npotential to induce anti-myeloma immunity. In our parent U01, we have utilized novel preclinical models to\nprovide definitive evidence that ASCT invokes myeloma-specific Th1 immunity and the re-establishment of a\nstate of immune equilibrium. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that disease progression after ASCT in these\nsystems is a result of CD8 T cell exhaustion that is dependent on the accumulation of myeloid suppressive\npopulations and the expression of multiple checkpoint molecules by CD8 T cells. This proposal will study the\nability to invoke long term myeloma-specific immune control by optimizing the administration of a novel Th1\ninducing synthetic cytokine, DR-18. DR-18 is a decoy resistant IL-18 that is not inactivated by the decoy IL-18\nbinding protein and preliminary data suggests it is highly effective in preventing myeloma progression. By\nworking with the Ring/Bosenberg U01 that developed DR-18, the major focus of this supplementary award will\nbe the optimization of this therapy for translation into the clinic in patients with myeloma over the next 1-2 years.

This approach holds\npromise to function as an effective immunotherapy against metastatic cancers in humans using monovalent\nFab fragments (Mono-Fabs) specific for the CD3 complex that is associated with the TCR. In the absence of\nstrong antigen, anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs do not stimulate T cell immune function because they do not crosslink\nreceptors for intracellular signaling. However, when exposed to antigen, T cells treated with anti-CD3 Mono-\nFabs increase their level of response to weak antigenic stimulation in vitro, indicating that the Fabs bound to\nCD3 alter the TCR/CD3 complex and enhance T cell triggering, an effect we denominate ‘receptor co-\npotentiation’. When tested in mice in vivo, anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs display therapeutic properties against\nmetastatic melanoma that depend on the presence of T cells able to recognize antigens associated with the\ntumor. Since anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs target the TCR/CD3 complex, testing combinations with alternative\nimmunotherapies that target other receptors on T cells was. Anti-CD3 Mono-Fabs showed a synergistic effect\nwith the alternative immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibition or adoptive cell therapy, which resulted in\nsignificantly extended survival of the mice tested. Now, Mono-Fabs specific for human CD3 have been\nidentified that may mediate T cell co-potentiation in vitro, as well produce anti-tumor T cell responses in two\ndifferent and ccomplementary humanized-mouse models of metastatic melanoma. In the present proposal,\ntransgenic mice expressing human CD3 will be crossed with inbred and outbred mouse strains in order to\nproduce different degrees of genetic diversity to resemble adult humans. Additionally, so called “dirty mice”\nfrom pet stores will also be co-housed with human CD3-transgenic mice to induce levels of “foreign” and\nimmune experience that better correspond with those observed in adult human immunotherapy patients. Mice\nfrom these various conditions will be used to determine the extent to which candidate anti-human CD3 Fabs\ndisplay anti-tumor potential against metastatic melanoma (aim 1), in single and combination immunotherapies\n(with checkpoint inhibition and adoptive cell theapy), as well as the extent to which immunotoxicity occurs (aim\n2). Results will inform the choice of optimal candidate(s) to subsequently undergo development for anti-cancer\ntranslational application. Finally, the CD3 signaling mechanism promoted by anti-human CD3e Fabs will be\nstudied in a mechanismtic manner to better understand T cell co-potentiation (aim 3). If successful, this project\nwill produce a novel modality of immunotherapy that may be exploited alone and/or to synergize other\nimmunotherapies, and will provide a biochemical mechanistic basis for this function. The hope is that soon\nthereafter, experimentation might advance these studies to translational application with an ultimate goal of\nhelping prolong survival of patients suffering from metastatic melanoma and additional malignancies.

However, a majority of patients\nremain resistant and cancer types can vary greatly in their response rates. Thus, there is an urgent need to\nunderstand the variation in response in order to improve cancer care. This proposal brings together a team of\ninvestigators with complementary expertise in basic, translational, and clinical science who share the long-term\ngoal of finding novel approaches to categorize and personalize cancer treatments. Recent results from the\ninvestigators suggest a major role for the packaging of immune checkpoint proteins in exosomes underlying the\nvariation in responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors among patients. Specifically, varying amounts of PD-L1\ncan be trafficked to exosomes, which in turn can act at a distance to suppress anti-tumor T cell function, enabling\ntumor progression, even in models resistant to anti-PD-L1 treatments. The objective of this proposal is to build\non these findings by focusing on the mechanism of exosomal PD-L1 packaging, action, and resistance to\ntherapeutic antibodies. In particular, the proposal will test the overall hypothesis that tumor cells can selectively\npackage PD-L1 into exosomes that suppress T cell priming at distal sights in a fashion that is distinct from the\ncell-cell interactions of PD-L1 and PD-1 normally seen in the tumor bed. The hypothesis is premised on extensive\npreliminary data using in vitro and in vivo models showing that the relative fraction of PD-L1 packaged in\nexosomes versus retained in cells varies between cell lines, that suppression of exosomal PD-L1 can result in\nlong-term systemic anti-tumor immunity, and that exosomal PD-L1 is resistant to anti-PD-L1 antibodies. To test\nthe overall hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: 1) Uncover mechanisms underlying the selective\npackaging of PD-L1 into exosomes, 2) Evaluate the mechanistic basis of exosomal PD-L1’s impact on systemic\nimmunity, 3) Dissect how exosomal PD-L1 interacts with and regulates its target cells. In aim 1, structure/function\nand proteomic approaches are proposed to identify the regulators of PD-L1 packaging into exosomes.\nFurthermore, associations between expression of these factors and resistance to therapy will be evaluated using\nprimary patient samples. In aim 2, mouse-based immunological approaches and patient samples will be used to\ndetermine where in the immune axis exosomal PD-L1 functions. Uncovered insights will then be used to develop\na novel therapeutic approach to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. In aim 3, microscopy and functional\nstudies in in vitro models along with association studies with patient samples will be used to determine how\nexosomal PD-L1 interacts with its target cells potentially explaining its resistance to antibodies. The proposal is\nhighly significant in that it is expected to provide new fundamental knowledge that can be used to identify and\ntreat the large fraction of patients resistant to current immune therapies. While this proposal focuses on a subset\nof cancer models with a particular emphasis on prostate cancer, the paradigms uncovered are expected to be\nrelevant across most if not all tumor types.

Although cytokine release\nsyndrome and neurotoxicity are the earliest and most dramatic immune related adverse events (irAEs) after\nCARTx, severe manifestations are transient and only affect a minority of patients. In contrast, on-target, off-\ntumor depletion of non-malignant B lineage cells affects the majority of patients and all long-term responders.\nCD19 expression declines as B cells differentiate into plasma cells, whereas BCMA is selectively expressed by\nplasma cells. Since plasma cells are responsible for maintaining long-lived antibodies and naïve/memory B cells\nare important for generating new immunity, CD19 versus BCMA-CARTx may differentially affect preexisting\nimmunity and vaccine responses. Dr. Hill’s goal is to understand the long-term effects of CARTx on humoral\nimmunity. This proposal incorporates the expertise of an outstanding group of researchers in infectious diseases,\nimmuno-oncology, epidemiology, laboratory medicine, and statistics who are dedicated to ensuring the success\nof this innovative research proposal. They will leverage their expertise and high-volume immunotherapy\nprograms to achieve the following aims.\nThe first Aim involves a prospective observational cohort study of 130 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 50\npediatric CD19, 30 adult BCMA) with relapse-free survival ≥6 months. Dr. Hill will use a novel systematic viral\nepitope scanning method (VirScan) to longitudinally characterize the antivirome to 206 viral pathogens. These\nresults will describe, and identify correlates of, antivirome diversity metrics at 6- and 12-months post-CARTx.\nVirScan will allow for a nuanced assessment of the differential impacts of CARTx on humoral immune\ncompetence. The second Aim will utilize samples from Aim 1 to determine the effect of CARTx on the durability\nof preexisting humoral immunity to vaccine-preventable infections and the proportion of patients lacking\nseroprotection after CARTx. These data will expand on Aim 1 to inform vaccination strategies. In the third Aim,\nDr. Hill will perform a prospective observational study of 95 CARTx recipients (50 adult CD19, 25 pediatric CD19,\nand 20 adult BCMA) to define the frequency and correlates of positive vaccine responses ≥6 months after\nCARTx. Patients will be vaccinated for S. pneumoniae, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, H. influenza b, and\nhepatitis A and B according to institutional guidelines.\nThis proposal will address critical knowledge gaps by employing innovative methods to elucidate the scope of\npathogen-specific deficits in humoral immunity, and whether vaccination can mitigate these irAEs, after CARTx.\nThe findings will guide evidence-based strategies for infection prevention, such as vaccination or immunoglobulin\nreplacement, to improve outcomes in this rapidly growing population of high-risk individuals.

project	1U01CA247576-01	1U01CA247576-01	9921965	2020	Adrenergic modulation of cellular immune functions in CAR T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome	Immunotherapy using tumor-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells (CART) is a rapidly-\nemerging, promising cancer therapy that can elicit rapid, durable clinical responses, seen in anti-CD19 CART\n(CART19)-treated CD19+ B-cell malignancies. However, CART-evoked severe or fatal immune-related adverse\nevents (irAE) including cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) are significant clinical barriers and safety concerns\nthat impede CART use in cancer patients, even with strict patient monitoring and supportive care. Current tools\nfor mitigating such immunotoxicities/CRS target individual cytokines/receptors (e.g. IL-6R, IL-1Ra, GM-CSF) or\nnonspecific immunosuppression, but preventing and treating such toxicity will require better understanding of\ncellular/molecular mediators of CART-induced CRS. This project aims to overcome these barriers and enable\nmore effective interventions against immunotoxicities, and thus more effective CART treatments, building upon\nthe PIs' novel, potentially translatable findings of a key role of catecholamines (CATs) in shaping CART therapy-\nassociated immune activation. We found that blocking CAT synthesis both reduced CRS during CART therapy\nin mice and also enhanced its tumor eradication, and also found that CAT levels are elevated in patients with\nCART-evoked CRS, and correlated with symptoms and IL-6 levels, suggesting CATs contribute to human CRS\npathophysiology. The project's goal is to identify the mechanistic CRS-modulating roles of these novel CAT\nactions and their impacts on macrophages and anti-tumor responses, and assess translational potential for\nimproving CART cancer therapy outcomes using human patient samples. Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the\nmediating α1-AR subtype and its role in modulating CART-evoked cytokine release and anti-tumor responses in\nvitro and in vivo, based on our finding that CAT-associated cytokine release is mediated by α1-adrenergic\nreceptors (α1-AR), of as-yet unknown subtype(s). We will identify the α1-AR subtype(s) that mainly mediate(s)\nCAT-evoked cytokine production in macrophages and CART, using in vitro co-culture assays and a mouse CART\ntherapy model via genetic knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) of α1-AR subtypes. 2) Determine the impact of\nmyeloid-derived CATs on cytokine release and myeloid function during CART-therapy in vitro and in a mouse\nmodel, by inactivating CAT synthesis in myeloid cells via tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) KO, and assess its impact\non cytokine release and macrophage function in a co-culture assay and in vivo using a LysM-Cre-mediated TH\nKO mouse. 3) Assess CAT induction in human patients during CART therapy, and CATs' dual impacts on irAE\nand tumor responses, and potential utility of CAT measures and blockers in predicting and preventing CRS, by\nquantifying circulating CAT and cytokine levels in patient serum samples collected during CART therapy, and\nevaluating correlations of CAT levels with clinical and laboratory CRS indices, anti-tumor responses and survival.

To date, most cancer research has employed established cancer cell lines and\ngenetically engineered mouse models. Although these models have provided tremendous insight into many\naspects of cancer initiation and progression, each of these models has important limitations, including adaptation\nto culture (cell lines), lack of genomic instability (mouse models), and inadequate representation of the spectrum\nof mutations and subtypes of human cancers. Next generation cancer models (NGCMs) such as organoid\nmodels have recently been developed. NGCMs address many deficits of prior models and promise to accelerate\ncancer research and experimental therapeutic efforts.\n Recent methodological advances now make it possible to create patient-derived cancer cell lines and\norganoids with increased efficiency. When coupled with genomic analysis, these new models may facilitate new\ninsights into human cancers. However, organoids require complex culture conditions and display distinct\nproperties that pose challenges for implementation of standard molecular and cell biology techniques. To\nfacilitate widespread use of organoid models within the research community, we must develop innovative\ntechnologies to overcome these challenges and enable study of organoids for a range of cancer phenotypes.\n In this Project, we will build on our expertise in the development of genome scale and informatic methods as\nwell as our work to derive many of the HCMI models with the goal of developing high throughput approaches to\nperform genetic and small molecule screens in patient-derived organoids created by the Human Cancer Models\nInitiative (HCMI). In addition, we will use innovative methods to interrogate cell state plasticity and heterogeneity\nin these models. These studies will allow the cancer research community to perform both high and low throughput\nanalyses in patient-derived models and to provide deep insight into the stability and phenotypes represented by\nthese models. While we will focus our technology development efforts using pancreatic cancer organoids, we\nanticipate that the approaches developed in this proposal will be widely applicable to many different models from\na range of cancer types.\n In Aim 1, we will develop and implement a highly multiplexed method to screen patient-derived organoid\nmodels with both small molecules and genetic reagents. These studies will provide a powerful approach to\ninterrogating HCMI models at high throughput. In Aim 2, we will build on our preliminary studies that indicate that\npatient-derived organoids exhibit heterogeneity and rapid shifts in expressed phenotypes. We will interrogate\nthe dynamics of these state changes and assess the degrees of heterogeneity in these models using newly\ndeveloped physical and sequencing methodology.

SPARKO can annotate\nheterogeneous cancer populations in living cells via fluorescent protein expression libraries to make multi-\ncolored tumor organoids. CombiGEM can rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets via large-scale,\nmassively parallel, and unbiased combinatorial genetic screens. Scanorama can integrate the analysis\nof large datasets of single-cell transcriptomics via sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. These tools\nfocus on barcoding strategies to enable accurate tracking and analysis of individual tumor cells that harbor\ndistinct genetic aberrations, and substantially expand the utility of the Next Generation Cancer Models\n(NGCMs) for cancer mechanistic investigations or therapeutic discovery. The StarOrchard tools enable\ntargeted genetic perturbations in annotated heterogeneous tumor phenotypes without destroying cells for\nsequencing.

Current gaps in implementation of\nguideline-adherent follow-up care based on inherited cancer genetic test results include\nboth over and under treatment among those with pathogenic and likely pathogenic\n(P/LP) variants or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Furthermore, we are missing\nthe opportunity to magnify the uptake and impact of testing among family members who\nare at high risk due to suboptimal family communication (FC) of genetic test results and\ncancer family history. Our highly innovative and practice-changing study is designed to\nshift the paradigm by which individuals with P/LP variants and VUS in inherited cancer\ngenes are provided with information to enhance guideline-adherent CRM and FC of test\nresults. Through our proposed type I effectiveness-implementation hybrid randomized\ncontrol mixed methods study, we will test two interventions with a diverse group of 600\nindividuals with a P/LP variant or a VUS result in a variety of inherited cancer genes for\nwhich CRM guidelines are available. Intervention A is focused on increasing guideline-\nadherent CRM (LivingLabReport), and Intervention B is focused on increasing FC and\nsubsequent family testing (GeneSHARE). Alongside developing, refining, and testing\ninterventions to improve guideline-adherent CRM and FC, we will study the\nimplementation of these interventions across racially, geographically, and socio-\neconomically diverse populations and settings. The information gathered through testing\neffectiveness and implementation of the interventions will be used to develop, modify\nand pilot test adaptive stepped interventions with the potential to efficiently maximize\neffectiveness in improving guideline-adherent CRM and FC. This transdisciplinary effort,\nenriched for accrual of Blacks, rural dwellers, and other underserved populations, will\ninform policy and the development of scalable models for delivering evidence-based\ncare. Ultimately, our study will help address the need for access to effective information\nto guide CRM and enhance FC in diverse populations across various genes and settings\nwhich is greatly needed if the population at large is to benefit from genomic advances in\nthis era of personalized medicine.

project	1U01DE028233-01	1U01DE028233-01	9625949	2018	Targeting the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to enhance efficacy of radiotherapy and immuno-radiotherapy for oral cancer	PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT:\nRadiation therapy (RT) is a mainstay of cancer treatment. However many tumors are resistant to RT, making it\npossible for microscopic tumor cells to remain or travel to other parts of the body and cause cancer recurrence\nat a later date. Immunotherapies can train the patient’s immune system to seek out and identify hidden tumor\ncells. The combination of RT with immunotherapy is a very exciting approach, but RT can have both immune-\nstimulating and immune suppressive effects, and further study is needed to understand how best to combine\nRT with immunotherapy. Many scientists now believe that understanding the tumor microenvironment – the\ntypes of cells which make up a tumor, and their interactions – is required to maximize the immune-stimulating\neffects of RT. We have discovered a strategy to alter the balance of cells in the tumor microenvironment of oral\ncancer and other solid tumor types, by simultaneously targeting immunosuppressive myeloid derived\nsuppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg), so that immune-stimulating effects of RT predominate.\nStudies in mouse tumors show that this strategy is particularly effective when combined with an\nimmunotherapy approach called “checkpoint inhibition” that targets molecules that limit effectiveness of anti-\ntumor T cells. This leads to our scientific hypothesis that tumor-infiltrating MDSC and Treg render the tumor\nmicroenvironment resistant to immune activation by RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, and limit the induction of\ntumor-specific CD8+ T cells and other immune effector immune cells. The goals of this proposal are to 1)\ndetermine whether modulating the tumor immune microenvironment enhances responsiveness of oral cancer\nto RT and/or checkpoint inhibition, leading to long-lasting and powerful anti-tumor effects; 2) determine the\nimmunological mechanisms which make these combination therapies effective; and 3) develop a novel drug\nformulation which will make this approach more effective and suitable for testing in clinical trials. We will\naccomplish these goals by carrying out the following specific aims:\nIn Aim 1 we will functionally dissect the immune mechanisms by which MDSC contribute to radioresistance\nin mouse oral cancer models.\nIn Aim 2 we will assess the ability of dual targeting of MDSC and Treg to sensitize oral cancer to treatment\nwith RT + anti-PD-1 and induce durable protective memory responses.\nIn Aim 3 we will develop a novel drug delivery system that can enhance delivery of inhibitors of MDSC function\ndirectly to the tumor and tumor-infiltrating MDSC.

project	1U01DE029188-01	1U01DE029188-01	9869230	2019	Defining mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nPD1 checkpoint blockade with nivolumab or pembrolizumab has given new hope for poor prognosis\nrecurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, but response rates of only\n15-20% highlight the need for continued investigation. In this application, we have assembled a\nmultidisciplinary team to address tumor cell intrinsic and adaptive resistance programs that are a critical barrier\nto immunotherapy. Together, this targeted and discovery based approach coupled with human functional\nimmunophenotyping aims to generate new translational approaches to improving response rates for HNSCC\npatients. The foundation of this proposal is based on supporting data showing robust preclinical modeling\nplatforms that span the spectrum of clinical responses to anti-PD1 therapy including response, intrinsic and\nadaptive resistance. Using high dimensional time of flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and an isogenic model of\nresponse and resistance, we identified distinct tumor microenvironmental remodeling with anti-PD1 and anti-\nCTLA4 therapies. We also completed a genome scale CRISPR screen for T cell recognition in a PD1 resistant\nHNSCC model and identified 355 candidate genes that may regulate this interaction. Candidates included\nones that may be relevant in all cancers as well as ones specific to HNSCCs. A major category to emerge from\nthis and other screens represents targets in the chromatin accessibility pathway. We validated a top screen\ncandidate that modulates chromatin accessibility, the histone methyltransferase and transcriptional regulator\nEzh2, and identified reduced anti-PD-1 resistance in combination with Ezh2 targeting. These data illustrate the\nvalidity of our approach as well as potential for clinical translation, as agents targeting Ezh2 are currently in\nclinical development. In a separate study of immunotherapy treated HNSCC patients, we identified mutations\nin SMARCA4, a catalytic subunit key for the PBAF nucleosome remodeling complex, in immunotherapy\nresponsive HNSCC patients, highlighting chromatin remodelers as modulators of immunotherapy response in\npatients and the potential for improved clinical management by targeting these activities in conjunction with\nimmunotherapy. In the proposed work, we will complete analysis of Ezh2 targeting with further validation of\ncandidate immunotherapy resistance modulators. Coupled with these preclinical studies we will complete\nfunctional immunophenotyping of human HNSCC patients using CyTOF and a novel patient derived\norganotypic platform. In parallel to these preclinical approaches, we have a strong clinical trial portfolio\nincluding a novel neoadjuvant pembrolizumab clinical trial that has shown surprising pathologic response in a\nsubset of patients and highlights this approach as an ideal setting in which to address resistance mechanisms\nin previously untreated patients. We will interrogate genomic data from our neoadjuvant trial to assess\nresistance mechanisms defined in preclinical models. In conclusion, this integrated approach will define\nmechanistic and therapeutic approaches to address the intrinsic immunotherapy resistance in HNSCC.

However, over 85% of the patients cannot benefit from this strategy, largely due to the highly\nimmunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in established cancers. Oral leukoplakias / Oral Epithelial\nDysplasias (OEDs) precede HNC and offer a unique time window for disease eradication. However, surgical\nresection in the orofacial region results in significant morbidity and function loss, and more importantly, cannot\nreverse field cancerization. A subset of OEDs transform into malignancy despite vigilant follow-ups. Frequent\nimmune cell infiltration is a common feature of OEDs, however, little is known about when and how OEDs\nevade from immuno-surveillance and reach a point-of-no-return. In addition, it remains unclear which sub-\ngroup of OEDs is more likely to suppress host immunity and establish themselves as high-risk lesions.\nAmplification of the chromosome locus 3q26.3 is a defining genomic feature of HNC, and two oncogenes at\nthis locus inhibit innate immune sensing pathways and elicit a metabolic restraint in the TME, which collectively\ndisadvantage anti-tumor immune cells. We have developed strategies to bypass the inhibition of innate\nimmune sensing and synthesized a novel drug-like molecule that exhibits potent metabolic remodeling\npotential and anti-tumor activity in vivo. We constructed two unique genetically engineered mouse models,\nwhich can model a spectrum of OED/HNC lesions with high-fidelity histologic and immunophenotypic\nresemblance to human diseases, to recapitulate 3q26.3-driven OED transformation. We also identified unique\ncollections of case-control and longitudinal paired OED/HNC specimens, which allow us to validate key\nfindings on the temporal shift of exploitable immune targets with clinical specimens. The overarching goal of\nthis translational program is to test the hypothesis that 3q26.3 amplification is a key early high-risk event that\nleads to OED immune escape and that a combination of metabolic remodeling agent with immunotherapy\neffectively prevents OED progression. Thus, this proposal is fully responsive to the RFA-CA-19-014 and is\nfocused on the deeper understanding of the time-course of immune landscape shift as pre-malignant lesions\nprogress, using 3q26.3 amplification-driven OEDs as a high-risk disease model. We will qualify a novel\nmetabolic remodeling drug-like molecule as a priming agent to maximally improve immuno-prevention. The\n3q26.3 amplification is not unique to HNC and commonly found in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung,\nesophagus and skin, hence, our findings will help address a broad class of public health concerns.	3q26;Address;Agonist;Automobile Driving;Bypass;CD8B1 gene;Cells;Chromosomes;Clinical;Collection;Cross-Priming;Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes;Dendritic Cells;Disadvantaged;Disease;Disease model;Effector Cell;Epithelial;Erythroplasia;Esophageal carcinoma;Event;Excision;Exhibits;Gene Expression Profile;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Glucose;Glycolysis;Glycolysis Pathway;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Histologic;Human;Hypoxia;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immune response;Immunity;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Immunosuppressive Agents;Immunotherapy;Infiltration;Interferon Type I;Interferons;Intraepithelial Neoplasia;Lead;Lesion;Longitudinal cohort;Lymphocyte;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic stress;Modeling;Molecular Profiling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mucous Membrane;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oral;Oral Leukoplakia;PIK3CA gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Premalignant;Prevention;Prevention strategy;Public Health;Regimen;Resolution;Signal Transduction;Skin Carcinoma;Specimen;Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma;Stains;Subgroup;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Time;Tumor Burden;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Warburg Effect;cancer cell;case control;combinatorial;design;effective therapy;extracellular;head and neck cancer patient;high risk;high risk population;human disease;immune activation;immune checkpoint blockade;improved;in vivo;individualized medicine;inhibitor/antagonist;loss of function;malignant mouth neoplasm;mutant;novel;novel therapeutics;oral cavity epithelium;orofacial;prevent;programs;public health relevance;recruit;response;restraint;tumor;tumor hypoxia;tumor microenvironment	UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR	ANN ARBOR	MI	UNITED STATES	John Chadwick Brenner,Yu Leo Lei,NOURI  NEAMATI	ZHONG  Chen	3799975	2516200	2019-09-25T04:00:00Z	2019-09-24T04:00:00Z	2024-08-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-19-014

Yet, safety is the\nbiggest barrier to broader implementation of this successful combination, due to much greater occurrence of\nserious immune-related adverse events (irAEs) compared to nivolumab alone. In particular, immune-related\ncolitis (irColitis) is the most common occurrence, with 10-15% of patients developing it upon receiving anti-\nCTLA-4 alone or in combinations. Such irColitis is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment with high-\ndose steroids or biologics such as anti-TNF, as well as ipilimumab or immunotherapy discontinuation. These\nsafety concerns have hampered the development of CTLA-4 targeting agents and may have reduced their\nefficacy due to lower recommended dosing in combination therapy and limited treatment course. There is\ntherefore an urgent need to comprehensively study the nature of irColitis and find whether potential risk factors\ncould be identified and mitigated for greater safety and efficacy of combination treatments.\n We have assembled a unique team of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) scientists and clinicians, tumor\nimmunologists, microbiome specialists, and medical oncologists specializing in immunotherapy of melanoma to\nanalyze colorectal tissue lesions, the gut microbiome, and peripheral blood biomarkers that could predict or\ncontribute to development of irColitis. By comparing what we already learned from studying biospecimens of\nIBD patients, i.e., their genetic subsets at the single cell level, gut microbiome, and predictive immune\nsignatures, we aim to characterize the transcriptomic, immunopathologic, serologic, and gut microbiome\nlandscape of irColitis and leverage this knowledge for better therapeutic options.\n We will address irColitis by characterizing gut biopsies of melanoma patients during treatment using single-\ncell RNA sequencing and multiplex immunohistochemistry mapping, and we will relate immune subsets and\nmarkers discovered to those found in IBD lesions. We will also measure peripheral blood serologic markers\n(anti-microbial and anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies by ELISA, soluble cytokine and protein analytes with Olink\nproximity extension assay) that we recently found to be risk factors detectable prior to development of IBD, and\nanalyze them for their capacity to predict irColitis. From stool collected before and throughout treatment, we\nwill analyze by 16S and metagenomic sequencing the gut microbiome of melanoma patients with or without\nirColitis to compare it to known colitogenic structure in IBD, and functionally assess bacterial communities in\ngnotobiotic models. Finally, we will integrate our findings to establish a mechanistic model of irColitis compared\nto IBD, to propose novel stratifications of cancer immunotherapy patients by risk factors, and to offer future\ntherapeutic opportunities, such as actionable tissue genomic and protein targets or fecal transplants.	16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Address;Antibodies;Autoantibodies;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;CTLA4 blockade;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials Design;Colitis;Colorectal;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Crohn&apos;s disease;Data;Development;Disease remission;Dose;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Feces;Flowers;Future;Genetic;Genomics;Gnotobiotic;Goals;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immunohistochemistry;Immunologist;Immunotherapy;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Intestines;Knowledge;Lamina Propria;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical Oncologist;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibodies;Nature;Nivolumab;Patient risk;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Predictive Value;Progression-Free Survivals;Proteins;Proteomics;Risk Factors;Safety;Scientist;Serological;Serum;Serum Markers;Specialist;Specimen;Steroids;Stratification;Structure;Symptoms;TNF gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Treatment Side Effects;Ulcerative Colitis;anti-CTLA4;anti-PD-1;antimicrobial;bacterial community;base;cancer immunotherapy;clinical development;cytokine;density;fecal transplantation;frontier;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;immune checkpoint;immune checkpoint blockade;immune-related adverse events;improved;melanoma;metagenomic sequencing;microbial;microbiome;microbiome analysis;microbiome composition;novel;patient subsets;peripheral blood;predictive marker;prospective;response;serological marker;single cell analysis;single-cell RNA sequencing;targeted agent;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions	ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Jean-Frederic  Colombel,Jeremiah James Faith,Sacha  Gnjatic	Terez  Shea-Donohue	594873	397393	2020-06-01T04:00:00Z	2020-06-01T04:00:00Z	2025-05-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-19-044

These\nsafety concerns have hampered the development of CTLA-4 targeting agents and may have reduced their\nefficacy due to lower recommended dosing in combination therapy and limited treatment course. There is\ntherefore an urgent need to comprehensively study the nature of irColitis and find whether potential risk factors\ncould be identified and mitigated for greater safety and efficacy of combination treatments.\n We have assembled a unique team of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) scientists and clinicians, tumor\nimmunologists, microbiome specialists, and medical oncologists specializing in immunotherapy of melanoma to\nanalyze colorectal tissue lesions, the gut microbiome, and peripheral blood biomarkers that could predict or\ncontribute to development of irColitis. By comparing what we already learned from studying biospecimens of\nIBD patients, i.e., their genetic subsets at the single cell level, gut microbiome, and predictive immune\nsignatures, we aim to characterize the transcriptomic, immunopathologic, serologic, and gut microbiome\nlandscape of irColitis and leverage this knowledge for better therapeutic options.\n We will address irColitis by characterizing gut biopsies of melanoma patients during treatment using single-\ncell RNA sequencing and multiplex immunohistochemistry mapping, and we will relate immune subsets and\nmarkers discovered to those found in IBD lesions. We will also measure peripheral blood serologic markers\n(anti-microbial and anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies by ELISA, soluble cytokine and protein analytes with Olink\nproximity extension assay) that we recently found to be risk factors detectable prior to development of IBD, and\nanalyze them for their capacity to predict irColitis. From stool collected before and throughout treatment, we\nwill analyze by 16S and metagenomic sequencing the gut microbiome of melanoma patients with or without\nirColitis to compare it to known colitogenic structure in IBD, and functionally assess bacterial communities in\ngnotobiotic models. Finally, we will integrate our findings to establish a mechanistic model of irColitis compared\nto IBD, to propose novel stratifications of cancer immunotherapy patients by risk factors, and to offer future\ntherapeutic opportunities, such as actionable tissue genomic and protein targets or fecal transplants.	16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Address;Antibodies;Autoantibodies;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;CTLA4 blockade;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Patient;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials Design;Colitis;Colorectal;Combination immunotherapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Crohn&apos;s disease;Data;Development;Disease remission;Dose;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Feces;Flowers;Future;Genetic;Genomics;Gnotobiotic;Goals;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immunohistochemistry;Immunologist;Immunotherapy;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Intestines;Knowledge;Lamina Propria;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical Oncologist;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibodies;Nature;Nivolumab;Patient risk;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Predictive Value;Progression-Free Survivals;Proteins;Proteomics;Risk Factors;Safety;Scientist;Serology;Serum;Serum Markers;Specialist;Specimen;Steroids;Stratification;Structure;Symptoms;TNF gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Treatment Side Effects;Ulcerative Colitis;anti-CTLA4;anti-PD-1;antimicrobial;bacterial community;base;cancer immunotherapy;clinical development;cytokine;density;fecal transplantation;frontier;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;immune checkpoint;immune checkpoint blockade;immune-related adverse events;improved;ipilimumab;melanoma;metagenomic sequencing;microbial;microbiome;microbiome analysis;microbiome composition;microbiome signature;novel;patient subsets;peripheral blood;predictive marker;prospective;response;serological marker;single cell analysis;single-cell RNA sequencing;targeted agent;transcriptomics;treatment response;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions	ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI	NEW YORK	NY	UNITED STATES	Jean-Frederic  Colombel,Jeremiah James Faith,Sacha  Gnjatic	Aynur  Unalp-Arida	577498	385790	2021-07-05T04:00:00Z	2020-06-01T04:00:00Z	2025-05-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-19-044

These long-standing racial/ethnic differences have yet to be explained. Genome-\nwide association studies of PCa conducted in AA men have provided clear support for genetic differences in the\nallelic architecture of PCa across populations and strong support for a genetic basis underlying population\ndifferences in risk. There are also multiple lines of evidence to support a genetic contribution to aggressive/fatal\nPCa including recent sequencing studies that have provided support for rare (<1%) protein coding variation in\ncontributing to aggressive PCa susceptibility. Cancer development and progression involves both the germline\nand somatic genomes however to date, discovery and characterization efforts of germline risk loci and somatic\nalterations in PCa have been conducted in isolation. We propose that large-scale efforts are warranted for the\ndiscovery of common and rare genetic variation that contributes to aggressive PCa susceptibility in AA men. In\naddition, through combining germline and somatic variation we expect to reveal novel biological mechanisms\nunderlying PCa aggressiveness. In this Project, we seek to identify genetic factors that are associated with PCa\naggressiveness in men of African ancestry. More specifically, in Aim 1, we plan to search for common germline\nvariants associated with PCa risk profiles in a case-case GWAS of 5,700 cases with high-risk (stage T3/T4 or\nGleason 8+ or PSA>20 ng/ml), 5,600 cases with intermediate-risk (stage T2b/T2c or Gleason 7 or PSA 10-20\nng/ml) and 3,800 cases with low-risk PCa (stage T1/T2a and Gleason ≤ 6 and PSA<10 ng/ml) from the\nRESPOND cohort and the African Ancestry PCa Consortium (AAPC). In Aim 2, we will conduct exome\nsequencing of these 15,000 PCa cases as well as 5,000 controls from AAPC to investigate the contribution of\nrare variation on PCa aggressiveness. In both Aims 1 and 2, single variant and gene burden association testing\nwill be conducted by case-case comparisons of high- vs. low-risk disease, as well as by multi-nominal\npolytomous logistic regression by risk category. In Aim 3, we will test the relationship between germline genetics,\nlifestyle factors and somatic tumor characteristics in AA men and assess whether germline genetics and lifestyle\nfactors interact with somatic profiles and transcription states to distinguish PCa risk profiles. We expect these\nintegrated germline-risk factor-somatic analyses to reveal tumor subgroups and shared biological mechanisms\nthat are clinically important in the future prediction of disease progression and survival. We expect the findings\nfrom this Project to significantly advance knowledge of susceptibility to aggressive PCa and racial/ethnic\ndisparities in PCa risk, and to guide the development of future preventive, early detection and prognostic\nmeasures for AA men.

project	5U24CA180803-04	5U24CA180803-04	9240602	2017	Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) Group	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of the imaging and Radiation Oncology Core (IROC) Group is to provide scientific and technical expertise for incorporation of appropriate, integrated Quality Assurance (QA) and image data management for both imaging and radiotherapy (RT) in applicable trials conducted by the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Program. The leading QA centers; RPC, QARC, RTOG QA, ITC, ACRIN and CALGB/SWOG Imaging Core lab, in the current NCI Cooperative Group Program have joined together to form the IROC Group, administratively organized through the American College of Radiology (ACR) Clinical Research Center. The creation of IROC capitalizes on existing infrastructure and expertise at QA Centers currently providing services to the NCI Cooperative Groups. Work flows, processes and information systems currently in place will be further enhanced taking the best practices and standards in an integrated vision. The interdependencies between imaging and RT will be synergized in this QA Group eliminating duplication of services and optimizing towards efficient and effective workflows. A major strength of IROC will be the development of consistent standard operating procedures for all imaging and RT aspects of the NCTN and to facilitate a seamless flow of imaging and RT patient case datasets across the network. IROC's organizational structure allows the delivery of a broad array of imaging and RT QA services including Site Qualification; Trial Design Support; Credentialing; Data Management (Pre- and Post- Review); and Case Review. An information technology infrastructure will be developed that harmonizes IROC services, data collection, assessment and management for the NCTN Groups' clinical trials. IROC will implement programs that assure consistent high quality imaging and RT planning/delivery across the NCTN participating sites. IROC members will collaborate with the NCTN disease/modality committees within each Network Group to provide an optimal and effective imaging and RT core service. IROC will analyze QA data obtained prospectively/retrospectively to further advance QA science. IROC will manage all aspects of QA for NCTN trials that includes imaging and/or RT with the shared goal to achieve the best possible trial outcomes.

project	5U24CA180924-04	5U24CA180924-04	9327975	2017	Tools to Analyze Morphology and Spatially Mapped Molecular Data	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is to develop, deploy, and disseminate a suite of open source tools and integrated informatics platform that will facilitate multi-scale, correlative analyses of high resolution whole slide tissue image data, spatially mapped genetics and molecular data for cancer research. This platform will play an essential role in supporting studies of tumor initiation, development, heterogeneity, invasion, and metastasis. These tools will allow quantitative analyses of the interplay between morphology and spatially mapped genetics and molecular data and will be used in studies that predict outcome and response to treatment, in radiogenomic and quantitative radiology imaging studies and in studies to identify cancer targets. The software and methods will enable researchers to assemble and visualize detailed, multi-scale descriptions of tissue morphologic changes originating from a wide range of microscopy instruments and make it possible to efficiently manage, interrogate, and explore microscopy imaging data at multiple scales and to identify and analyze features across individuals and cohorts. The project will build on and extend the software and methods we have developed in microscopy imaging, integrative image analysis, high performance computing, databases, and visualization over the past fifteen years and will also leverage, integrate and adapt the Harvard Slicer platform. The design and implementation of the informatics platform will be driven by four well funded, leading edge cancer focused studies along with many additional collaborative efforts including the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), the Mayo Clinic Quantitative Imaging Network site, the Colon Cancer Family Registry and the Polyp Prevention Study.	3-Dimensional;Anatomy;Automobile Driving;Biomedical Research;Brain Neoplasms;Cancer Research Project;Clinic;Cloud Computing;Collaborations;Communities;Complex;Computer Simulation;Computer software;Data;Data Analytics;Databases;Department of Energy;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Distant;Doctor of Philosophy;Educational workshop;Foundations;Funding;Genetic;Genomics;Grant;Heterogeneity;High Performance Computing;Image;Image Analysis;Imagery;Individual;Informatics;Institution;Laboratories;Lead;Leadership;Letters;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Maps;Medical Imaging;Methods;Microscopic;Microscopy;Molecular;Morphology;National Cancer Institute;National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering;Neoplasm Metastasis;Ohio;Pathology;Pattern;Performance;Play;Polyps;Positioning Attribute;Prevention;Principal Investigator;Proteomics;Radiogenomics;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resolution;Resource Sharing;Role;Running;Science;Shotguns;Site;Slide;Structure;System;The Cancer Genome Atlas;Three-Dimensional Image;Time;Tissue Sample;Tissue imaging;Tissues;Training;United States National Library of Medicine;Universities;Work;analytical method;anticancer research;cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid;cancer cell;cancer clinical trial;cancer imaging;cohort;colon cancer family registry;design;digital;experience;image archival system;imaging modality;imaging study;in vivo imaging;innovation;instrument;laser capture microdissection;melanoma;method development;microscopic imaging;middleware;next generation;novel therapeutics;online resource;open source;outcome prediction;predicting response;programs;protein expression;public health relevance;quantitative imaging;radiological imaging;reconstruction;research and development;sialodacryoadenitis virus;tool;tool development;treatment response;tumor;tumor initiation	STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK	STONY BROOK	NY	UNITED STATES	Joel H.

project	5U24CA180996-05	5U24CA180996-05	9334747	2017	Cancer Genomics:Integrative and Scalable Solutions in R / Bioconductor	DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal develops scalable R / Bioconductor software infrastructure and data resources to integrate complex, heterogeneous, and large cancer genomic experiments. The falling cost of genomic assays facilitates collection of multiple data types (e.g., gene and transcript expression, structural variation, copy number, methylation, and microRNA data) from a set of clinical specimens. Furthermore, substantial resources are now available from large consortium activities like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Existing analysis pipelines focus on the treatment of a specific data type, leaving a critical need for tool for integrative analysis of multiple genomic assays for locally generated or publicly available data. R / Bioconductor has historically provided standardized genomic data structures and annotations that have enjoyed widespread adoption in the cancer genomics research community. This proposal adapts R / Bioconductor to meet the increasing conceptual and computational complexity of multi-assay cancer genomic experiments. We begin by developing software containers for coordinated representation, manipulation, and transformation of heterogeneous derived data from multiple cancer genomic assays. These containers are then extended to manage very large primary data resources. To facilitate integration of local experimental results with major public cancer genomics experiment data sets and annotations, we re-package public resources and provide software and cloud-based facilities for easy and fast programmatic access from within R/Bioconductor. This greatly simplifies cancer genomic analysis tasks that otherwise require significant, error-prone individual efforts. Finally, we provide software infrastructure to enable high-throughput computation using parallel and iterative approaches. The ability to manipulate multi-assay cancer genomic experiments, to understand individual experimental results in the context of public experiments and annotations, and facilities for improved high-throughput computational performance in a well-established computing environment greatly enhances opportunities for analysis and comprehension of large multi-assay cancer genomic experiments.

It is widely used by the cancer genomics\nresearch community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core\ndata classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and\nefficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data.

The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to\nmeet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of\nsingle-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant\nprioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of\nexperimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create\nprovenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in\nprioritization. Third, we develop scalable infrastructure for the curation, distribution, maintenance,\ndiscoverability, and usability of cancer data resources within and externally to Bioconductor.

It is widely used by the cancer genomics\nresearch community for statistical analysis and visualization. This software ecosystem is supported by core\ndata classes and methods, reused by both users and developers, that provide convenient representations and\nefficient operations for many kinds of high-throughput molecular data. Falling sequencing costs and single-cell\nassays enable increasingly resolved study of the molecular biology of cancer, through combined assaying of\nDNA sequence, epigenetics, gene expression, protein, and other aspects, even at the single-cell level, for a\nsingle specimen. These developments present new challenges in complexity, size, and interpretability of the\ndata. The overarching goal of this project is to create and adapt core Bioconductor software infrastructure to\nmeet these challenges, through the following aims. First, we develop infrastructure for the analysis of\nsingle-cell multi-omic experiments. Second, we implement FAIR principles for improved somatic variant\nprioritization, by defining performant data architecture that harmonizes and integrates the large amount of\nexperimental and annotation data available through Bioconductor. Users of our system will be able to create\nprovenance-rich interoperable reports on structural and functional contexts of somatic variants for use in\nprioritization. Third, we develop scalable infrastructure for the curation, distribution, maintenance,\ndiscoverability, and usability of cancer data resources within and externally to Bioconductor. Finally, we\ndevelop a program of user training and new outreach approaches to support adoption of advanced\nBioconductor infrastructure by developers of new cancer-related packages and existing packages critical to the\ncancer research community.

Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data\nsuch as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities.

project	5U24CA199347-02	5U24CA199347-02	9275443	2017	A Galaxy‐based multi‐omic informatics hub for cancer researchers	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Galaxy bioinformatics framework is used by thousands of cancer researchers, primarily for genomics-based studies. It's open and flexible environment enables interoperation of diverse bioinformatics software via a user-friendly web-based interface. Despite its proven value for genomic bioinformatics, Galaxy's potential for enabling cancer research has not been fully realized. One area of emerging potential for Galaxy is multi- omic informatics. Multi-omics integrates high throughput genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomics data to reveal new molecular discoveries in cancer. For example, integrating metabolomics information with genomic and/or proteomic data reveals biochemical consequences of gene and protein variations underlying carcinogenesis. Integration of genomic or transcriptomic data with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic data (proteogenomics) identifies novel protein variants linked to genome mutations. Integration of metagenomic data with MS-based proteomic data (metaproteomics) identifies proteins expressed by microbial communities giving insights into biochemical contributions from the microbiome to carcinogenesis. Despite their potential pay-off, these multi-omic approaches require use of diverse informatics tools out of the reach of most bench researchers. Fortunately, Galaxy offers a solution. We propose to extend Galaxy and create a powerful, unified hub for multi-omic informatics. We will focus on enhancing Galaxy with a stand-alone Multi-omics Visualization Platform (MVP) for results visualization and interpretation. We will build novel Galaxy extensions enabling metabolite profiling, results interpretation and targeted clinical validation studies. We will extend current Galaxy-based tools to create a complete solution for proteogenomic and metaproteomic informatics, making easy-to-build workflows that ensure accurate results. Finally, we will empower cancer researchers to use Galaxy for multi-omics in their work via a variety of dissemination and training activities. We will achieve these outcomes via these Specific Aims: 1) Extend a Galaxy-compatible Multi-omics Visualization Platform (MVP) for enhanced results interpretation and data exchange utilizing cancer knowledge bases and informatics resources; 2) Extend Galaxy and the MVP tool for metabolite profiling in cancer research; 3) Extend Galaxy and the MVP tool for integrative genomic-proteomic informatics and workflows.; 4) Catalyze the use of multi-omic workflows and associated tools by cancer researchers via dissemination, promotion and training activities. Our work will be guided via driving cancer projects with a network of collaborators. We will partner with developers of established software and methods in different 'omic domains, and utilize world-class infrastructure at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. Our deliverables will directly complement other projects currently funded through the NIH ITCR program.

project	3U24CA199347-02S1	3U24CA199347-02S1	9471698	2017	Expanding multiplexed kinase biosensor analysis to SWATH-MS (Part 2 of 2)	﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Galaxy bioinformatics framework is used by thousands of cancer researchers, primarily for genomics-based studies. It's open and flexible environment enables interoperation of diverse bioinformatics software via a user-friendly web-based interface. Despite its proven value for genomic bioinformatics, Galaxy's potential for enabling cancer research has not been fully realized. One area of emerging potential for Galaxy is multi- omic informatics. Multi-omics integrates high throughput genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomics data to reveal new molecular discoveries in cancer. For example, integrating metabolomics information with genomic and/or proteomic data reveals biochemical consequences of gene and protein variations underlying carcinogenesis. Integration of genomic or transcriptomic data with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic data (proteogenomics) identifies novel protein variants linked to genome mutations. Integration of metagenomic data with MS-based proteomic data (metaproteomics) identifies proteins expressed by microbial communities giving insights into biochemical contributions from the microbiome to carcinogenesis. Despite their potential pay-off, these multi-omic approaches require use of diverse informatics tools out of the reach of most bench researchers. Fortunately, Galaxy offers a solution. We propose to extend Galaxy and create a powerful, unified hub for multi-omic informatics. We will focus on enhancing Galaxy with a stand-alone Multi-omics Visualization Platform (MVP) for results visualization and interpretation. We will build novel Galaxy extensions enabling metabolite profiling, results interpretation and targeted clinical validation studies. We will extend current Galaxy-based tools to create a complete solution for proteogenomic and metaproteomic informatics, making easy-to-build workflows that ensure accurate results. Finally, we will empower cancer researchers to use Galaxy for multi-omics in their work via a variety of dissemination and training activities. We will achieve these outcomes via these Specific Aims: 1) Extend a Galaxy-compatible Multi-omics Visualization Platform (MVP) for enhanced results interpretation and data exchange utilizing cancer knowledge bases and informatics resources; 2) Extend Galaxy and the MVP tool for metabolite profiling in cancer research; 3) Extend Galaxy and the MVP tool for integrative genomic-proteomic informatics and workflows.; 4) Catalyze the use of multi-omic workflows and associated tools by cancer researchers via dissemination, promotion and training activities. Our work will be guided via driving cancer projects with a network of collaborators. We will partner with developers of established software and methods in different 'omic domains, and utilize world-class infrastructure at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. Our deliverables will directly complement other projects currently funded through the NIH ITCR program. The upshot of our work will be a large network of cancer researchers empowered to utilize high impact, multi-omic approaches, ultimately catalyzing new discoveries that will help decrease the suffering and death from cancer.

MD Anderson Cancer Center has been a leader in the\nimplementation of this antibody-based technology that can assess many protein markers across large numbers\nof samples in a cost-effective, sensitive and high-throughput manner. The platform currently assesses ~300\nprotein markers, covering all major signaling pathways and most drug targets. Its utility was demonstrated\nthrough its selection as the sole platform for characterizing >10,000 patient samples through The Cancer\nGenome Atlas (TCGA); and recently it has been designated as one of two NCI Genome Characterization\nCenters, and will characterize up to ~10,000 samples from ongoing NCI initiatives and other consortium\nprojects. For TCGA project, the applicants built The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), a web platform for\nvisualizing and analyzing RPPA data, which has a community of >5,000 users worldwide. The long-term goal\nis to promote the ability of functional proteomics to impact cancer research and the development of relevant\ntherapeutic strategies. The current objective is to expand the scope of TCPA by adding new functionalities and\ndatasets, and to enhance and improve its existing analytic capabilities. Working relationships have been\nformed to link TCPA with other widely used bioinformatic resources (e.g., cBio, UCSC Genome Browsers,\nFirehose and Synpase) and other ITCR projects. An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled\nto pursue four specific aims: Aim #1. Develop an open source, all-in-one software package for processing\nRPPA data. This effort will standardize each informatic step for RPPA data generation including experimental\ndesign, quality control, and data normalization. The resultant program will be exported to other RPPA facilities.\nAim #2. Expand and enhance our existing web platform for the analysis of patient-cohort RPPA data. The web\nplatform will cover other patient cohorts, incorporate other types of molecular/clinical data, and provide\npathway/network-based analytics. Aim #3. Build a user-friendly, interactive, open web platform for the analysis\nof cell line RPPA data. This effort will collect and compile RPPA data of >1,500 cell lines, and develop a web\nplatform parallel to Aim #2. Aim #4. Promote TCPA and active interaction with the user community. This effort\nwill provide documentation, hands-on workshops, and bug fixes, and build web APIs for interaction with other\ntools. The expected outcome is the first, dedicated bioinformatic resource that fully integrates RPPA data\ngeneration, analysis and user feedback, allowing for fluent exploration and analysis of high-quality proteomic\ndata in a rich context. The project is important because it will greatly enhance the quality and reproducibility of\nRPPA data from important consortium projects; substantially reduce barriers biomedical researchers face in\nmining complex functional proteomic data; serve as a hub for integrating proteomic data into other widely used\nbioinformatic resources; and directly facilitate development of protein markers for precision cancer medicine.

MD Anderson Cancer Center has been a leader in the\nimplementation of this antibody-based technology that can assess many protein markers across large numbers\nof samples in a cost-effective, sensitive and high-throughput manner. The platform currently assesses ~300\nprotein markers, covering all major signaling pathways and most drug targets. Its utility was demonstrated\nthrough its selection as the sole platform for characterizing >10,000 patient samples through The Cancer\nGenome Atlas (TCGA); and recently it has been designated as one of two NCI Genome Characterization\nCenters, and will characterize up to ~10,000 samples from ongoing NCI initiatives and other consortium\nprojects. For TCGA project, the applicants built The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA), a web platform for\nvisualizing and analyzing RPPA data, which has a community of >5,000 users worldwide. The long-term goal\nis to promote the ability of functional proteomics to impact cancer research and the development of relevant\ntherapeutic strategies. The current objective is to expand the scope of TCPA by adding new functionalities and\ndatasets, and to enhance and improve its existing analytic capabilities. Working relationships have been\nformed to link TCPA with other widely used bioinformatic resources (e.g., cBio, UCSC Genome Browsers,\nFirehose and Synpase) and other ITCR projects. An experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled\nto pursue four specific aims: Aim #1. Develop an open source, all-in-one software package for processing\nRPPA data. This effort will standardize each informatic step for RPPA data generation including experimental\ndesign, quality control, and data normalization. The resultant program will be exported to other RPPA facilities.\nAim #2. Expand and enhance our existing web platform for the analysis of patient-cohort RPPA data. The web\nplatform will cover other patient cohorts, incorporate other types of molecular/clinical data, and provide\npathway/network-based analytics. Aim #3. Build a user-friendly, interactive, open web platform for the analysis\nof cell line RPPA data. This effort will collect and compile RPPA data of >1,500 cell lines, and develop a web\nplatform parallel to Aim #2. Aim #4. Promote TCPA and active interaction with the user community. This effort\nwill provide documentation, hands-on workshops, and bug fixes, and build web APIs for interaction with other\ntools.

Through this one-year supplement, the\nCoordinating Center will continue to collect and annotate resources for the CCKP with a focus\non enriching the resource annotations to improve exploration, search, and discovery, and\nintegrating annotations around consortia researchers that will provide links from personnel to\nresources and information about roles and activities of personnel in the consortia. The Center\nwill also continue to drive collaboration through special interest groups and working groups that\nengage researchers at different career levels around common scientific themes underlying\ncancer systems biology. During the next year, there will be an active focus on recruiting early\ncareer researchers in these collaborative efforts.

We have assembled an outstanding team of basic and clinical scientists to discover and confirm proteins\nand protein modifications associated with cancer progression using genoproteomic approaches. This\nmultidisciplinary team will be managed by the same three Principal Investigators (PI) and consists of\ninternationally recognized experts in proteomic technologies, genomics, proteogenomics-specific bioinformatics,\nbiostatistics, oncology, pathology, cancer biology, assay development, quality control, technology optimization,\nand clinical laboratory science/clinical chemistry. Our team has complementary and integrated expertise with\nprevious and ongoing successful collaborations. The plan is to integrate the genomics findings with proteomic\nanalysis (genoproteomics) and to overcome the caveats and challenges in the comprehensive understanding of\ntumor biology. We believe that genomic data provides a highly valuable molecular route towards the identification\nof genes and pathways that could be useful for the detection, differential diagnosis, outcome prediction and\ntherapeutic targets of cancer. The proteomic approaches will provide the identification of unique features that\nare inherent to proteins including post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation.\nWe propose to use the technology platform validated during the current CPTAC which is high throughput, robust\nand state of the art. These technologies are proven, with the capability of generating reproducible results across\nlabs. We will use a two-step strategy to characterize defined sets of genomically-characterized samples. The\nfirst step is the discovery of target proteins from both biological and clinical specimens using mass spectrometry\nand affinity based technologies. The second step is the confirmation of these targets using high-throughput,\nCPTAC Tier 2 analytically validated targeted assays, for example, Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass\nSpectrometry (MRM-MS). In addition, we propose to develop pilot studies for technology improvement. The goal\nis to generate accurate, reproducible, sensitive, quantitative, and multiplexed assays using optimized and\nstandardized high-throughput technologies for the discovered targets. While this PCC application is focused on\nthe proteomic characterization of biological and clinical specimens, we believe that the understanding of and\nexpertise in proteogenomic data analysis and translation will be critical for the success of the PCC and the overall\nCPTAC network. Investigators/PIs from our proposed PCC will be part of applications for the CPTAC\nProteogenomic Data Analysis (PGDAC) and Translational Research (PTCR) Centers. Collaboration and team\nwork are key to the success of the CPTAC program. With this multidisciplinary team of outstanding basic and\nclinical scientists, our PCC offers the best opportunity for the successful characterization of biological and clinical\nspecimens to discover and confirm cancer targets to advance precision cancer medicine.

In the next phase, the National Cancer Institute and its Center for\nCancer Genomics are planning large-scale projects closely tied to clinical questions and\ntrials. In order to perform the analysis of these data, the NCI is creating a Genome Data\nAnalysis Network (GDAN) of different types of Genome Data Analysis Centers (GDACs).\nCentral to this Network is a single Processing GDAC, which will take all the harmonized\ndata, as stored in the NCI's Genomics Data Commons, and perform higher level integrated\nanalyses on these data to support both the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) within the\nNetwork (which will be formed for each project to perform special analyses of the data and\nwrite manuscripts) as well as the entire biomedical research community.\nHerein we propose to build the centralized Processing GDAC on top of our FireCloud\nplatform, an infrastructure to run large scale computation on the cloud in a fully rigorous\nand reproducible fashion. FireCloud development was based on our experience with\nFirehose, the Broad internal platform on which the standard TCGA data and analyses\ncurrently run. We propose to create and operate the GDAN Standard Workflow,\nincorporating tools actively developed and used within the GDAN and across the entire\nfield, with particular emphasis on clinical tools. This Workflow will serve as the starting\npoint for AWGs and set the highest standards of transparency, reproducibility and rigor for\ncancer genome analysis. The results of the Standard Workflow will be stored in a public\ndatabase, and accessible via standard APIs, and used together with a continuously\nupdated database of prior knowledge to create scientific reports that will be made available\nto the community, in a pre-publication manner. Finally, a major innovation is that AWG\nmembers will be able to login into FireCloud and rerun the entire workflow, or parts of it,\nwith their own parameters and subsets of the data – thus making the entire GDAN analysis\nfully reproducible and scalable.\nOur goals are therefore: (1) To create a global infrastructure for collaborative extreme-\nscale cancer analysis; (2) Operate the Standard Workflows at scale; (3) Rapidly and\ncontinuously evolve the Standard Workflows; and (4) created improved capabilities for\nreporting, exploring the results, clinical diagnostics and reproducibility.

Although recent advances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various solid cancers,\ncomparable efficacy in PDAC has been limited by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) that creates an\nimmune suppressive milieu ripe for tumor progression. Thus, bold interventions that can overcome immune\nbarriers in the PDAC TME are urgently needed to reduce the mortality stemming from this recalcitrant disease.\nThe U01 “Consortium for PDAC Translational Studies on the TME” was created through the National Cancer\nMoonshot initiative to accelerate the pace of progress in innovative therapies targeting the TME in PDAC,\nespecially those geared towards immune-based modalities. Our proposal is in response to the companion U24\nRFA to create a resource center for the five funded Consortium sites, which we call Pancreatic Ductal\nAdenocarcinoma Translational Resource Center (PATReC). The PATReC will be co-led by Drs. Ignacio\nWistuba and Anirban Maitra, two established molecular pathologists at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center\n(UTMDACC) with long-standing expertise in cancer biomarkers, tissue based molecular profiling, and with\nrespect to one co-leader (AM), specific expertise in PDAC biology, disease models and experimental\ntherapeutics. They will be supported by an exceptional supporting cast, including Drs. Jack Lee (biostatistics),\nAndy Futreal (cancer genomics and computational biology), Jason Roszik (bioinformatics) and Stan Hamilton\n(co-leader of the NCI MATCH biorepository). The overall goal is to support the consortium efforts in multiple\nareas including: providing an administrative infrastructure for coordinated interactions amongst the U01\nawardees; facilitating centralized biospecimen banking and distribution; enabling centralized data storage\ncapabilities; and credentialed biostatistics and bioinformatics support with the ultimate goal of designing\ntranslationally relevant combination interventions targeting the TME in PDAC. In Aim 1, we will support\nadministrative coordination amongst the U01 sites by ensuring effective communication, cooperation, and\naccess to rapid data exchange that will advance the goals of the individual Consortium sites. The PATReC will\nserve as the central “hub” for virtual and in-person communication across the entire Consortium. In Aim 2, we\nwill utilize our unique institutional infrastructure to provide centralized data management services that will be\nreadily accessible to all Consortium sites via a secure website, and provide bioinformatics and biostatics\nservices for the analyses and interpretation of data. In Aim 3, we will standardize bio-banking activities and\ndevelop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing and distribution, as well\nas provide access to biologically relevant PDAC preclinical resources. We envision that the PATReC will be\nan indispensable element as we make meaningful progress towards targeting the TME in this lethal disease.

However, results from individual\nresearch groups have been difficult to validate due to the lack of standardized PDX procedures, lack of scale\nfor adequately powered PDX studies and the inability to efficiently share PDX specimens. A key contributor to\nthis challenge is the lack of well-managed resources for community sharing and large-scale analysis of\nintegrated, standardized datasets from PDX models. The JAX-Seven Bridges PDX Data Commons and\nCoordination Center (PDCCC) seeks to address this challenge and unite the efforts of the component data-\ngenerating (PDX Development and Trial Centers/PDTCs) and PDX model sharing (NCI’s Patient-Derived\nModel Repository/PDMR) parts of the PDX Development and Trials Centers Research Network (PDXNet) into\na cohesive, trans-Network whole. Using innovative cloud computing and bioinformatic approaches, our\nPDCCC will provide administrative and computational infrastructure for PDXNet to enable PDX method\nstandardization, model sharing, data sharing, and massive-scale data analysis. We will build a data storage,\nsharing, and analysis platform that harmonizes PDXNet data with other large datasets and analysis workflows\navailable in the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud. Simultaneously, we will administer planning meetings, training\nactivities, and research pilots to build synergies within the PDXNet, enhancing the ability of the PDXNet to\ndevelop clinical trials from PDX studies. Our Specific Aims are to 1) establish a leadership and\nadministration unit to manage and coordinate activities within PDXNet, including annual meetings,\nregular conference calls, training activities, trans-Network pilot projects, and outreach; 2) develop a cloud-\nintegrated PDXnet Data Commons that integrates PDXNet data with the existing cloud-based data analysis\nplatform - the Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud (SB-CGC); and 3) build analysis workflows and data\nsharing practices to optimize PDXNet research and enable PDXNet data to facilitate clinical trial design. To\naccomplish these Aims we have assembled a team with unique expertise in PDXs, cancer treatment, genomic\nanalysis, data coordination, and project management from The Jackson Laboratory and Seven Bridges. Our\ncombined institutional strengths include a history of leadership in (and commitment) to PDX, data resource,\nanalytic and consensus standards development and application; practical expertise in PDX model sharing and\ncollaborative community efforts; a broad array of statistical, bioinformatic, and software-related PDX resources;\nleadership expertise in large-scale, cloud-based biomedical data projects, notably the SB-CGC; and deep\nexperience in high-performance database engineering and development. Our goal is to build an innovative,\nsystematically organized PDCCC that will advance the efforts of PDXNet to improve the validity—and expand\nuse—of the PDX system as a preclinical platform for precision oncology.

project	1U24CA224285-01	1U24CA224285-01	9455402	2017	Translational Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (TCIMAC)	ABSTRACT\nAdvances in immunotherapy have shown efficacy in various cancers. Immunotherapeutic approaches are\nbecoming the new treatment modality in some cancer types. However, clinical efficacy is still limited to a\nmarginal number of patients due to a newly developing understanding of the complex tumor microenvironment\nand a limited ability to appropriately select patients who have specific biomarker signatures and have the\npotential to optimally respond to specific immunotherapy or combination strategies. An additional challenge in\nassessment of biomarkers that show clinical utility to predict patient benefit includes the use of different\nmethodologies and platforms that make it difficult to make accurate conclusions on the biomarkers in question.\nThus, optimized biomarker strategies that can overcome immune barriers will allow tailoring of the therapeutic\napproaches and result in bold interventions that would be most beneficial to individual patients. The National\nCancer Moonshot was launched in 2016 with the goal of boldly combating cancer beyond incremental\nadvances leading to the creation of a “Cancer Immunotherapy Translational Science Network” that would\nfacilitate translational research and clinical advances in immunotherapy.  Our proposal to create a resource\ncenter, named Translational Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center (TCIMAC) that will be a\ncritical resource capable of serving any of the NCI-supported clinical trial networks. The TCIMAC will be co-led\nby Drs. Ignacio Wistuba, renowned cancer surgical and molecular pathologist, Elizabeth Mittendorf, well-known\nbreast cancer surgeon and immunologist, and Chantale Bernatchez, cancer immunologist. They will be\nsupported by a team that encompasses a multidisciplinary group of world-class and highly collaborative\nexperts on cancer and immunotherapy. The main goals of TCIMAC are to: 1) provide centralized and\nharmonized services for sample collection, processing and quality assurance, and 2) use analytically-validated\nand standardized assays and platforms to offer state-of-the-art analyses for patients enrolled on NCI-\nsponsored early phase immunotherapy clinical trials. In Aim 1, we will assist in standardizing bio-banking\nactivities and share/develop standard operation procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen collection, processing,\nquality assessment, and storage of biospecimens collected from NCI-sponsored early phase immunotherapy\nclinical trials and to link the specimens to relevant clinical, pathological, immune and molecular data within the\nTCIMAC-CIDC Network. In Aim 2, we will provide services to conduct both routine and innovative pathological,\nimmunological and molecular analyses using standardized and validated assays to aid the completion of NCI-\nsponsored trials. In Aim 3, we will provide comprehensive biostatistics and computational services for data\ncollection and analysis for each analytical platform, and to perform analyses, interpretation and predictive\nmodeling of high dimensional (`omic”) data in the context of clinical outcomes. We envision that the TCIMAC\nwill be an indispensable element as we make meaningful progress in cancer immunotherapeutic approaches.

Translational studies with strong focus on biomarkers are critical to\nunderstanding the tumor-immune interface. Although numerous technologies for tumor and immune profiling\nare applied to NCI sponsored immunotherapy trials, standardization of both assay protocols and data analysis\nmethods is crucial to data integration and comparisons across studies for biomarker identification. This\nunderlines the need for data harmonization and creation of uniform analysis pipelines.\nWe propose to establish the Cancer Immunology Data Commons (CIDC) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\nwith the goal of advancing translational research efforts using biomarkers to aid in the further\ndevelopment of cancer immunotherapy. The short-term objectives of this application are to establish and\nmanage the data repository for biomarkers and associated clinical data for Cancer Immune Monitoring\nand Analysis Centers (CIMACs), and provide an informatics environment for integrative multi-\ndimensional analysis across different studies and storage of data generated. Specifically, we propose to:\nAim 1, coordinate with the CIMAC and Laboratory Coordinating Committee (LCC) to harmonize establish\nassay protocols and data format standards; Aim 2, develop a centralized data repository and management\nsystem, and coordinate CIMAC data submission to the CIDC; Aim 3, develop uniform bioinformatics\nprocessing pipelines and computing infrastructure for computationally intensive analyses for the CIMACs and\nthe larger research community; Aim 4, provide bioinformatics algorithms to enable integrative and correlative\nanalysis of CIMAC data and integrate other accessible databases and resources for biomarker discovery; Aim\n5, develop centralized role-based data access functions with advanced programming interface to enable\nsharing of CIMAC data; Aim 6, develop interactive web visualization functions to enable investigators and the\nimmunology communities to examine the CIMAC data; and Aim 7, coordinate within the CIMACs-CIDC\nNetwork logistic and scientific activities for biomarker discovery and validation.\nAt the conclusion, we will have established a biomarker repository for all data and results generated by\nCIMACs, supplemented with standardized informatics tools for integration with other accessible databases,\nand compatible for data contribution and secondary analyses by external researchers. These efforts will\nprovide bioinformatics support for the CIMACs-CIDC Network. The established Data Commons will also\nprovide the foundation for a future immuno-oncology data resource for the larger research community.

project	1U24CA224319-01	1U24CA224319-01	9457012	2017	High-Dimensional Immune Monitoring of NCI-Supported Immunotherapy Trials	PROJECT SUMMARY\nImmunotherapy is transforming decades of clinical practice in cancer care, but it also comes with new\nquestions about understanding mechanisms of action contributing to both antitumor activity and potential\nassociated toxicity. Most importantly, identifying why only a fraction of patients derives clinical benefit is at the\nforefront of future developments, with the ever-elusive validation of useful clinical biomarkers as the ultimate\ngoal. As a consortium of immunologists, technologists, clinicians, computational biologists, data specialists,\nand biostatisticians, the Mount Sinai CIMAC (MS-CIMAC) is uniquely positioned to generate immune profiling\ndatasets at an unprecedented level of granularity to identify biomarker signatures of disease course and\nresponse to immunotherapy in cancer patients. MS-CIMAC will take full advantage of the smart cancer\nimmunotherapy trial designs championed by the NCI that mandate collection of baseline and on-treatment\nbiospecimens. Key strengths of MS-CIMAC are expected to be in unique high-dimensional yet sample-sparing\napproaches, including CyTOF mass cytometry, seromics, microbiome, and multiplex chromogen IHC, thanks\nto the implementation of cutting-edge yet validated protocols and analysis pipelines. Through a comprehensive\narray of assays and analytical tools that bridge innovation and standardization, MS-CIMAC intends to pursue\nthe following three aims: a) help characterize immunocompetence at baseline and assess global immune\nchanges during treatment, b) drill down the specificity and quality of immune responses for mechanistic\nevaluation of drugs, and c) automate, optimize, and integrate analyses of resulting datasets to facilitate\nsharing, and to ultimately discover composite immune biomarkers that will impact clinical cancer care.

project	1U24CA224331-01	1U24CA224331-01	9457104	2017	Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center	Summary\nThe critical role of the immune system in effecting anti-tumor responses to traditional and molecularly-targeted\ntherapies is increasingly recognized, such that there is now an explosion of activity in the clinical investigation\nof immuno-oncology. In parallel, we have gained great advances in our ability to extract useful biologic\ninformation from patient material through the development of: (i) high-throughput DNA/RNA sequencing, that\nhas uncovered major genetic determinants of clinically-evident immune responses; (ii) highly multiplexed\nbiological assays, that have revealed the complex interplay between immunity and cancer in relation to\ntherapy; and (iii) advanced computational methods, that have enabled large-scale integrative data analysis.\nUnderlying this activity is a need to identify the critical biomarkers of response and resistance to\ntherapy in each disease and across diseases. With the rapidly evolving clinical and experimental\ndevelopments in immunotherapy occurring across all major academic centers, the need to build a coordinated\ninfrastructure for data collection, processing and analysis has emerged as a high priority. At Dana-Farber\nCancer Institute (DFCI), the Center of Immuno-Oncology (CIO) was established several years ago and is a\nlocal hub of translational immuno-oncology activity. As a part of its mission, the CIO supports dedicated\ntranslational biomarker laboratories to provide expertise in the analysis of immune correlatives in the service of\nimmuno-oncology trials. Collectively, these resources provide multidisciplinary capabilities supporting both\ninvestigator-initiated and externally-sponsored studies ranging from clinical trial design, the performance of\nwell-validated immune monitoring capabilities on patient samples during trials, the interpretation of data from\nimmune monitoring testing, and the development of novel assays based on the scientific questions motivated\nby individual clinical studies. We propose to expand the laboratory and biostatistical capabilities of the\nCIO along with those of additional DFCI units as a Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Center\n(CIMAC). We want to coordinate the efforts of the proposed DFCI-CIMAC with other CIMACs and with the\nCancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) to develop the standards for designing studies rich with immune\ncorrelatives and informative for candidate biomarkers, to be tested in future trials. Aim 1 focuses on\nharmonizing the technical aspects of assays offered by the CIMACs; Aim 2 focuses on the assay-specific\nscoring analyses and reporting of CIMAC offerings. Modeled on our long history of implementing standard and\ninnovative assays to study DFCI phase I/II trials, we describe a process for using `Tier 1' `shovel-ready' assays\nthat we expect as standard components of an immune monitoring tool-kit and `Tier 2' assays that are tailored\nto the specific needs of a study (Aim 3). Altogether, these efforts fall within the concept and vision of\npersonalized medicine for immuno-oncology because only by the analyses of large well-annotated datasets\ncan we identify links between biology, molecular markers and clinical response.

Utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach, we will support Immuno-Oncology\nTranslation Network (IOTN)-funded components to discover new immune targets and evaluate novel immune-\nbased therapies and combination approaches that eliminate established cancers in adults or to prevent\ncancers before they occur. Our DMRC strategy is to serve as an administrative and analytic hub at every step\nof the IOTN's translational studies, focusing to reduce the barrier for access to analytic expertise, improve the\nproductivity of IOTN investigators, maintain a high standard for data collection and management, design and\nperform rigorous analytical strategies, and foster a collaborative and supportive research community.\nAn experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: First, we will provide\na centralized administration infrastructure to coordinate IOTN activities, building upon the NRG Oncology\nStatistical and Data Coordinating Center's experience of coordinating over 450 translational cancer studies\nacross hundreds of participating sites. Second, we will provide multidisciplinary analytic expertise to support\nIOTN collaborative research, leveraging five of RPCI CCSG's shared resources: Biostatistics, Bioinformatics,\nBiomedical Data Science, Data Bank and BioRepository, and Immune Analysis. Our analytic support will be\narmed with professional IT staff and informed by an experienced IO researcher team. Third, we will develop\ninnovative data integration methods to enhance IOTN research capacity, capitalizing on the well-respected\nBioconductor project and the independent research programs of the RPCI department of Biostatistics and\nBioinformatics. Fourth, we will actively promote the IOTN and engage in trans-consortium interactions, where\nwe will leverage Bioconductor's decade-long experience in community engagement and the NRG data center's\nrich expertise in project coordination. Leveraging our active NCI-funded RPCI-committed resource to support\nthe proposed multi-institutional trans-disciplinary IO research is not only cost-effective, but also flexible in its\nstudy-dependent scalability.

Utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach, we will support Immuno-Oncology\nTranslation Network (IOTN)-funded components to discover new immune targets and evaluate novel immune-\nbased therapies and combination approaches that eliminate established cancers in adults or to prevent\ncancers before they occur. Our DMRC strategy is to serve as an administrative and analytic hub at every step\nof the IOTN’s translational studies, focusing to reduce the barrier for access to analytic expertise, improve the\nproductivity of IOTN investigators, maintain a high standard for data collection and management, design and\nperform rigorous analytical strategies, and foster a collaborative and supportive research community.\nAn experienced, multidisciplinary team has been assembled to pursue four specific aims: First, we will provide\na centralized administration infrastructure to coordinate IOTN activities, building upon the NRG Oncology\nStatistical and Data Coordinating Center’s experience of coordinating over 450 translational cancer studies\nacross hundreds of participating sites. Second, we will provide multidisciplinary analytic expertise to support\nIOTN collaborative research, leveraging five of RPCI CCSG’s shared resources: Biostatistics, Bioinformatics,\nBiomedical Data Science, Data Bank and BioRepository, and Immune Analysis. Our analytic support will be\narmed with professional IT staff and informed by an experienced IO researcher team. Third, we will develop\ninnovative data integration methods to enhance IOTN research capacity, capitalizing on the well-respected\nBioconductor project and the independent research programs of the RPCI department of Biostatistics and\nBioinformatics. Fourth, we will actively promote the IOTN and engage in trans-consortium interactions, where\nwe will leverage Bioconductor’s decade-long experience in community engagement and the NRG data center’s\nrich expertise in project coordination. Leveraging our active NCI-funded RPCI-committed resource to support\nthe proposed multi-institutional trans-disciplinary IO research is not only cost-effective, but also flexible in its\nstudy-dependent scalability. Taken together, we envision that our DMRC, in close collaboration with the IOTN,\nwill allow us to conduct highly effective and innovative translational studies to address the significantly unmet\nclinical needs related to IO.

We will provide key services to organize and support\nthe Research Centers that comprise this network, and foster a community based on\ncollaboration, transparency, and sharing. Our primary scientific objective is to accelerate the\ndiscovery of mechanisms governing tumorigenesis, progression, and evolution, which will lead\nto improved prevention and treatment strategies for patients. We aim to achieve this by\nproviding technology services coupled with best practices to expedite data acquisition and\ndissemination to HTAN researchers, as well as the broader scientific community. Computational\npipelines will be developed and shared to enable data harmonization, and analytic tools and\nvisualizations will be hosted on cBioPortal to facilitate data access and analysis for a wide\nspectrum of users ranging from data scientists and statisticians to biologists and clinicians. We\nwill also host crowd-sourced challenges to engage researchers outside of HTAN to address\nimportant scientific questions.

The initial availability of SARDANA images has\nhighlighted the challenges faced by HTAN, including the DCC, in deploying an infrastructure for\ndistributing large and complex images. We therefore propose a two-year HTAN Image Data\nProject (IDP) led by the DCC and HMS PCA focused on the rapid development and deployment\nof image informatic systems and computational resources for image management and analysis.\nOur goal is to put in place a functional first-generation system no later than summer 2020 and to\nthen steadily refine the system so that it becomes the backbone of cross-functional HTAN\natlases. As a matter of necessity, we will start with informatic systems and software that are\neither available today or in a relatively advanced state of development. However, we expect to\nevaluate these choices throughout the IDP and change course as necessary to incorporate\npotentially superior approaches. We will also support the diverse needs and formats of centers\nusing different data collection methods. Aim 1 will focus on the deployment and progressive\nimprovement of a cloud-based database for image management based on the OMERO\nstandard as well as a parallel system for access to primary data. Aim 2 will develop and deploy\nsoftware for visualizing HTAN image data by the general public. The IDP will use the existing\nMCWG and DAWG mechanisms for oversight and reporting, and all centers will be invited to\nparticipate. Within IDP, the HMS PCA will take primary responsibility for initial deployment of\nimage informatics software. The DCC and HMS will jointly undertake software development and\ncode hardening, and the DCC will take the lead in user assistance and software deployment,\nparticularly in year two.

project	1U2CCA233195-01	1U2CCA233195-01	9626781	2018	The Cellular Geography of Therapeutic Resistance in Cancer	Most patients who die from cancer do so because their cancer is resistant to available therapies, either\nintrinsically, or as it evolves in response to treatment. However, the fundamental mechanisms driving resistance\nremain largely unknown. Tumors are comprised of a complex multicellular ecosystem of malignant and non-\nmalignant cells, and changes in their composition, states, spatial organization and interactions are central to\ntherapeutic resistance. Thus, there is an enormous need to chart an atlas of a tumor's cells, their spatial\norganization and interactions as those change dynamically in resistance to therapy. Technological\nbreakthroughs in spatial and single-cell genomics, including many innovations by our team, now put an atlas\nwithin reach, but harnessing this remarkable opportunity, requires collection of multiple spatial and single cell\ngenomics data in clinical samples; novel study design strategies; new experimental and computational strategies\nto integrate across cellular and spatial data; algorithms to construct tumor atlases that capture the resistant state;\nand showing how to use an atlas to formulate and test new predictive models of resistance. The Boston Human\nTumor Atlas Network Research Center (HTA-RC) will address each of these challenges by creating three\ncomprehensive atlases of the cellular geography of human cancer to understand how changes in the\ntumor ecosystem lead to therapeutic resistance in: (1) Primary and acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition\nin breast cancer; (2) Primary and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic melanoma;\nand (3) Primary resistance to immunotherapy in microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal carcinoma (CRC)\ncompared with microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC. All three tumors types tackle an unmet clinical need; have an\napproximately equal rate of resistance and response to allow comparisons between states; and harness\nsignificant clinical experience and build on substantial preliminary results at our center. To construct the atlases,\nwe will collect at least 100 biospecimens per year from resections and biopsies of the three tumor types and\nanalyze them with histopathological data, high-resolution spatial multiplex RNA and protein data, single-\ncell genomics data, and temporal clinical data. Our algorithms will recover key features of each data modality,\nand integrate them into a single atlas to determine what predicts and underlies resistance. We build on a\nwell-established interdisciplinary team in two major cancer centers (DFCI, MGH) and four research\ninstitutions (Broad, Harvard, Stanford, Princeton). Our leadership (Haining, Regev) and Units comprise of\nforemost experts and pioneers in clinical genomics (Biospecimens; Johnson, Wagle), spatial and single cell\ngenomics (Shalek, Rozenblatt-Rosen, Nolan, Zhuang), and computational biology and data science (Regev,\nVan Allen, Engelhardt). Our atlases will allow identification of predictive biomarkers of resistance in the tumor\necosystem, and therapeutic target discovery, targeting diverse facets of the complex tumor ecosystem.

project	1U2CCA233238-01	1U2CCA233238-01	9627274	2018	The Lung PCA: A Multi-Dimensional Atlas of Pulmonary Premalignancy	Abstract:\nLung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide chiefly due to our inability to detect the\ndisease at its earliest stage and the lack of interventions to prevent its development in those at highest risk.\nThe rate-limiting step to developing new approaches for lung cancer detection and prevention is our lack of\nunderstanding of the earliest molecular and cellular changes associated with lung carcinogenesis. We propose\nto develop a high-resolution, multidimensional genetic, molecular, and cellular atlas of pre-cancerous lung\nlesions and their surrounding microenvironment for lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, the\ntwo most common subtypes of lung cancer. We will leverage unique retrospective and prospective cohorts\nassembled at multiple medical centers via our Biospecimen Unit to collect, annotate, and process premalignant\nlesion biospecimens of the lung and airway. Our Characterization Unit will apply existing and emerging\nmolecular profiling tools to characterize the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic landscape of these lesions.\nPipelines for standardized multidimensional data processing, quality control, analysis and integration will be\ndeveloped by our Data Analysis Unit, leading to creation of a web-based portal for data dissemination and\nonline integrative analysis to benefit the greater research community. Cross-sectional sampling of\npremalignant squamous and adenomatous lesions adjacent to early stage cancer will enable development of a\nspatial map that will provide insights into the evolution of premalignant cells and their microenvironment. Our\nlongitudinal study of airway premalignant squamous lesions that progress toward or regress away from\ninvasive carcinoma will provide both a temporal and spatial map of the molecular determinants of invasive\ncarcinoma. We will also leverage this longitudinal study to demonstrate the clinical utility of our Lung Pre-\nCancer Atlas through development of prognostic biomarkers of premalignant progression that can be applied\nclinically for precision management, as well as to stratify patients with aggressive premalignant squamous\nlesions into early-phase intervention trials. Successful completion of the Atlas will be accelerated by: (1) a\nhighly-coordinated Administrative Core that will facilitate interactions within and across Units, as well as the\nexchange of data, methods, and tools with other centers within the HTAN; and (2) partnerships with ongoing\nNCI, foundation, and industry lung premalignancy initiatives. Our Lung Pre-Cancer Atlas will ultimately serve\nas a resource for the medical and scientific communities to enable the development of biomarkers for early\ndetection and risk stratification, as well as identification of novel targets for therapies that will intercept the\ndevelopment of lung cancer.

project	1U2CCA233254-01	1U2CCA233254-01	9627374	2018	Breast Pre-Cancer Atlas Center	ABSTRACT – Overall\nDevelopment of invasive breast cancer may frequently progress through a preinvasive precursor called ductal\ncarcinoma in situ (DCIS). DCIS is an extremely common clinical diagnosis that is essentially a disease of\nscreening triggered by the detection of abnormal breast calcifications on mammography. Before the advent of\nmammography, DCIS was an incidental and relatively uncommon finding. Over 60,000 women in the United\nStates will be presented with this diagnosis each year with relatively weak evidence-based guidance for\ndisease management which ranges from active surveillance to bilateral mastectomy. We propose to compile\nmulti-dimensional and multi-scale information on DCIS to construct a Pre-Cancer Atlas that can be used to\nbetter understand the disease but also to better stratify risk of progression, a useful translational endpoint. To\ndo this, we have assembled a team of investigators with deep and complementary clinical, experimental, and\nquantitative expertise and experience with DCIS and breast cancer in general. Further, we conduct these\nstudies with full consideration of tumor evolution and ecology as it pertains to precancer development and\nprogression. Specific aspects of the proposed Atlas construction include: 1) Several types of DCIS cohorts that\nwill capture spatial and longitudinal information including a prospective clinical trial cohort undergoing active\nsurveillance, 2) Analyses designed to maintain relevant spatial organization of the disease for evolutionary and\nAtlas building considerations based on 3) Radiologic-histologic-cellular-molecular registration approaches, 4)\nCharacterization at multiple scales including whole tumor, single duct and single cell levels, 5) Characterization\nof relevant parameters including mutations, copy number changes, methylation, gene expression, and\nmicroenvironmental elements including inflammatory cell profiles. 6) Incorporation of the breast cancer intrinsic\nsubtype paradigm into the analytic phase, and 7) Layered, spatial, and longitudinal data visualization. Overall,\nthis work will provide a comprehensive platform to guide the next generation of studies on DCIS and other\nprecancers.

project	3U2CCA233254-01S1	3U2CCA233254-01S1	10269615	2021	Extension to the HTAN Pre-Cancer Atlas Project	For many cancer types, the wide-spread adoption of cancer screening has increased the\ndetection of pre-malignant lesions (PML). Despite such efforts, screening has had limited impact\non overall survival. Clinical guidelines vary widely from watchful waiting (e.g., prostate) to radical\nsurgery and adjuvant treatment (e.g., breast). In absence of reliable progression risk biomarkers\nand models, these interventions may have deleterious consequences at the two clinical extremes:\ndelay in life-saving treatment or overtreatment. The study of pre-malignant lesions (PML) at\nmolecular level present significant challenges: PML are small, generally archived in formalin.\nMoreover, the clinical significance of any identified marker can only be assessed after long follow-\nup, limiting the translational studies to retrospective collections. These hurdles have prevented\nthe development and application of precision medicine approaches and unbiased biomarker to\ndevelop models of progression. The current proposal will extend the MCL Pre-Cancer Atlas Pilot\nProject (PCAPP initiated in September 2017) with the goal to build multi-modal profiles of\nhighly characterized pre-malignant lesions from the 4 target organs (Lung, Breast, Prostate\nand Pancreas). The four organs included represent a diverse spectrum of histology - pure\nhistology or mixed with invasive lesions - and clinical settings - treatment or active surveillance.\nSimilarly, the selected profiling methods are as comprehensiveas for invasive tumors atlas (whole\ntranscriptome gene expression or DNA mutations) but also innovative, focusing on micro-\nenvironment and exploring spatial heterogeneity (multiplex IHC) and, for a few cases, cellular\nheterogeneity (single-nuclei sequencing). The propose extension will support the completion of\nthe PCAPP and enable a uniform data analysis and sharing with the community.

project	1U2CCA233262-01	1U2CCA233262-01	9627416	2018	Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center)	SUMMARY-ABSTRACT\n The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre-\nmalignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre-\nmelanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to\nmyeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as\nshaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the\nCenter for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary\ntechnical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision\nprevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the\nmolecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk\nindividuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials.\nThis will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex\ntissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.\n Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination\nwith HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with\nthree subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists\nand a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological\nspecimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository\nwill provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in\nprospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an\noncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high-\nplex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic\nimmunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate\nreagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications.\nAim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to\nmanage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most\ntechnically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each\nin preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm\ndevelopment. The resulting human browsable and machine-readable atlases are expected to yield new\nscientific discoveries, demonstrate the feasibility and utility of new technologies and help to reduce the\nincidence of life-threatening cancers of the skin and blood.

project	3U2CCA233262-01S1	3U2CCA233262-01S1	10252281	2020	Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center)	SUMMARY-ABSTRACT\n The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre-\nmalignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre-\nmelanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to\nmyeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as\nshaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the\nCenter for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary\ntechnical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision\nprevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the\nmolecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk\nindividuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials.\nThis will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex\ntissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.\n Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination\nwith HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with\nthree subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists\nand a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological\nspecimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository\nwill provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in\nprospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an\noncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high-\nplex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic\nimmunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate\nreagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications.\nAim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to\nmanage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most\ntechnically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each\nin preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm\ndevelopment. The resulting human browsable and machine-readable atlases are expected to yield new\nscientific discoveries, demonstrate the feasibility and utility of new technologies and help to reduce the\nincidence of life-threatening cancers of the skin and blood.

The\nOMS Atlas is motivated by the fact that these treatments typically are only transiently effective in the metastatic\nsetting. Possible resistance mechanisms may be intrinsic to the tumor cells or derive from the diverse\nmicroenvironments in which the tumor cells live. The OMS Atlas will focus on elucidating these resistance\nmechanisms in three specific current generation clinical scenarios: (a) hormone-receptor positive breast cancer\n(HRBC) undergoing treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy, (b) triple negative\nbreast cancer (TNBC) undergoing treatment with a PARP inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and (c)\ncastration resistance prostate cancer (CRPC) undergoing treatment with enzalutamide. We will accomplish this\nthrough work in four areas. A Biospecimen Unit will prospectively collect, manage, and distribute longitudinal\nclinical information, blood, and biopsies from 20 patients from each of two metastatic breast cancer cohorts and\none prostate cancer cohort that will be analyzed to create three OMS Atlases. The biopsies will be preserved to\nenable analyses using multiple characterization modalities. A Characterization Unit will analyze (a) OCT frozen\nspecimens using Topographic Single Cell Sequencing (TSCS) and Single-cell Combinatorial Indexing ATAC-\nseq (sci-ATAC-seq) to elucidate spatially defined genomic changes and chromatin accessibility in single cells,\n(b) formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) to\nassess the immune microenvironment and cyclic Immunofluorescence (cycIF) to assess the composition and\nmolecular states of tumor cells and their microenvironments, and (c) paraformaldehyde fixed, resin embedded\n(PFRE) specimens using a Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM) to identify\nultrastructural changes in 2D images and targeted 3D images with 4-nm resolution. Omic characterization of the\nsame tumor samples will be provided by the SMMART Program. A Data Analysis Unit will develop and deploy\ntools to (a) manage, analyze, and visualize Tier 1 data comprised of raw sequence data and images to generate\nunimodal Tier 2 results, (b) integrate omics and imaging data through crosswise mapping to create single\ntimepoint tumor maps and quantify systems biological functions of tumor cellular subpopulations to generate Tier\n3 results, and (c) explore differences between pre- and on/post-treatment tumor maps to reveal mechanisms of\nresistance that comprise Tier 4 results. We will collaborate with private sector partners to evaluate and adopt\nnext generation technologies that increase analytical power and speed and reduce costs. The Administrative\nUnit will facilitate the coordination, operation, interaction, and evaluation of activities within the OMS Atlas and\nbetween OMS Atlas scientists and the HTAN.

Cancers in children are highly\ndistinct from those in adults. Causes, mechanisms and therapeutic approaches cannot be extrapolated from\nthe study of adult malignancies. To impact the burden of pediatric cancers requires the specific study of\npediatric cancers. We therefore propose the in depth characterization of three specific subtypes of pediatric\nmalignancies which, together, account for over 50% of all pediatric cancer deaths: high grade glioma (pHGG),\nhigh risk neuroblastoma (NB), and very high risk acute lymphoblastic B-cell precursor leukemia (VHR-ALL). All\nthree tumor types share a characteristic of typically initial response to therapy, followed by the emergence of\nresistance and refractory disease. We will map molecular and cellular changes in tumor cells,\nmicroenvironment and the immune system using comprehensive multi-dimensional single-cell and in situ\ntechnologies associated with two critical transitions: initial response, and emergence of resistant disease –\nboth high-priority transitions. Treatment modalities will include standard chemotherapy, molecular targeted\ntherapies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-) T cell therapy, capturing the cutting edge of current cancer\ntherapy. The final product will impact global childhood cancer research in the following manner: 1) Tumor\nAtlases: atlases will provide a highly user friendly, publicly available, searchable database of the most\ncomprehensive multi-omic, single cell analysis of the three most lethal childhood cancers. Molecular data will\nbe richly annotated with access to additional pathological evaluation, clinical and outcomes data, and grant\naccess to source data such tumor imaging. 2) Computational methods: in addition to the data, the critical\ncomputational tools and pipelines used in this project will be available to the research community. These\ninclude methods and pipelines for processing multi-omics and in situ data, inference of cancer phylogeny,\ninference of cell- and clone-specific pathways, methods for inferring cell-cell crosstalk, as well as database\nalgorithms for the query, exploration and visualization of highly complex data. 3) Access to biospecimens for\nfollow up studies: biospecimens collected in this project will be banked and made available to the biomedical\nresearch community. These include tissue sections, viably frozen specimen, and patient derived xenograft\n(PDX models). In summary, the proposed project will seek to address a major public health need in pediatrics,\nbroadly impact the entire research community, and jumpstart target discovery based on a sophisticated\nunderstanding of the key molecular circuits that drive pediatric cancer.

project	1U2CCA233291-01	1U2CCA233291-01	9627573	2018	Integrative Single-Cell Atlas of Host and Microenvironment in Colorectal Neoplastic Transformation	PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top three most prevalent cancers in\nglobal incidence and mortality. Most of these cancers develop from pre-cancerous adenomas. Colonoscopy is\ncurrently the most effective CRC prevention strategy. However, colonoscopy may fail to prevent carcinoma in\nas many as 24% of cases, is less effective at preventing proximal CRCs, is expensive for health care systems\nto implement, carries economic and psychosocial burdens for patients, and can be complicated by bleeding,\nperforation, and other adverse events. There is an unmet need to develop new preventive strategies and risk\nstratification models to address these and other issues. By analysis of whole human tissue, seminal work from\nBert Vogelstein and co-workers demonstrated that CRC develops from an accumulation of genetic events as\ntumors evolve from small to large adenomas and, eventually, to cancers. More recently, our group reported the\nfirst comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of CRC, which also was from a bulk analysis of whole\ntissue Despite this wealth of data on CRC, we believe that the ability to provide the most effective precision\ndiagnostics and preventive strategies can only be achieved with single-cell analysis. Through such a single-cell\nanalysis, we propose to map spatial relationships across the spectrum of normal colon, early polyps, and late\nadenomas, including their unique stromal and microbial microenvironments. Aim 1: To construct a pre-cancer\natlas of colorectal adenoma progression that depicts the spatial landscape of the tumor ecosystem, including\nthe stroma and biofilm-associated microbiome, using single-cell (sc)RNA-seq, whole exome sequencing,\nmultiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), and species-specific bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\nAim 2: To integrate the activities and data from the Biospecimen, Tissue Characterization and Data Analysis\nUnits for the prospective standardized collection and analysis of colorectal tissue, associated biospecimens,\nand related clinical and epidemiological data from 1,800 participants undergoing colonoscopy or surgical\nresection. Aim 3: To disseminate the pre-cancer atlas, related biospecimens, primary data sets and analytical\ntools to the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), the broader scientific community, and the lay public. To\naccomplish these aims, we have assembled a highly interactive and established team of investigators with\ncomplementary expertise (epidemiologists, gastroenterologists, pathologists, surgeons, systems biologists,\nbioinformaticians, cancer biologists, immunologists, and biofilms/infectious disease experts). To further\noptimize our novel methodologies for application to the prospectively collected samples from 1,800 atlas\nparticipants, we will leverage our existing large repository of colorectal adenomas and supporting\nbiospecimens, generated and curated through an ongoing epidemiological project through 3 cycles of the\nVanderbilt GI Special Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE).

Most of these cancers develop from pre-cancerous adenomas. Colonoscopy is\ncurrently the most effective CRC prevention strategy. However, colonoscopy may fail to prevent carcinoma in\nas many as 24% of cases, is less effective at preventing proximal CRCs, is expensive for health care systems\nto implement, carries economic and psychosocial burdens for patients, and can be complicated by bleeding,\nperforation, and other adverse events. There is an unmet need to develop new preventive strategies and risk\nstratification models to address these and other issues. By analysis of whole human tissue, seminal work from\nBert Vogelstein and co-workers demonstrated that CRC develops from an accumulation of genetic events as\ntumors evolve from small to large adenomas and, eventually, to cancers. More recently, our group reported the\nfirst comprehensive proteogenomic characterization of CRC, which also was from a bulk analysis of whole\ntissue Despite this wealth of data on CRC, we believe that the ability to provide the most effective precision\ndiagnostics and preventive strategies can only be achieved with single-cell analysis. Through such a single-cell\nanalysis, we propose to map spatial relationships across the spectrum of normal colon, early polyps, and late\nadenomas, including their unique stromal and microbial microenvironments. Aim 1: To construct a pre-cancer\natlas of colorectal adenoma progression that depicts the spatial landscape of the tumor ecosystem, including\nthe stroma and biofilm-associated microbiome, using single-cell (sc)RNA-seq, whole exome sequencing,\nmultiplex immunofluorescence (MxIF), and species-specific bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\nAim 2: To integrate the activities and data from the Biospecimen, Tissue Characterization and Data Analysis\nUnits for the prospective standardized collection and analysis of colorectal tissue, associated biospecimens,\nand related clinical and epidemiological data from 1,800 participants undergoing colonoscopy or surgical\nresection. Aim 3: To disseminate the pre-cancer atlas, related biospecimens, primary data sets and analytical\ntools to the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), the broader scientific community, and the lay public. To\naccomplish these aims, we have assembled a highly interactive and established team of investigators with\ncomplementary expertise (epidemiologists, gastroenterologists, pathologists, surgeons, systems biologists,\nbioinformaticians, cancer biologists, immunologists, and biofilms/infectious disease experts). To further\noptimize our novel methodologies for application to the prospectively collected samples from 1,800 atlas\nparticipants, we will leverage our existing large repository of colorectal adenomas and supporting\nbiospecimens, generated and curated through an ongoing epidemiological project through 3 cycles of the\nVanderbilt GI Special Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE). We are confident that our application, in\ntoto, is greater than the sum of its parts, and we look forward to robust bi-directional interactions with HTAN.

project	1U2CCA233311-01	1U2CCA233311-01	9627723	2018	Precancer Atlas of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third highest cause of cancer death in the United States. Almost 80% of\nsporadic colorectal cancers have an APC gene mutation. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a hereditary\ncolon cancer syndrome, is also caused by mutations in APC and affects children as young as 7 years of age.\nFAP causes hundreds of colonic polyps in affected individuals and a 100% lifetime risk of CRC. In preliminary\nefforts we have successfully collected hundreds of pre-cancerous colon polyps from individual FAP patients,\napplied genomic, epigenomic and other multi-omic analyses and begun to elucidate the impact of multiple\ntypes of “omic” alterations on precancerous colon polyp evolution toward CRC. We propose to use an\nintegrated and collaborative approach to develop a PreCancer Atlas for colorectal adenocarcinoma using FAP\nas the disease model. We will:\n1) Establish a biospecimen collection pipeline for procurement of longitudinal tissue samples during\nsurveillance colonoscopy and during prophylactic surgical colectomy, including whole blood, serum, normal\ncolonic tissue, colon microbiome, benign pre-cancerous polyps, dysplastic precancerous polyps and colon\nadenocarcinomas.

Medical records, longitudinal samples and all relevant metadata will also be collected.\n2) Establish a center to characterize the tissue samples with state-of-the-art omics and imaging technologies.\nThese include but are not limited to whole genome sequencing, methylation, transcriptome, proteome,\ncytokine, metabolome, microbiome, and molecular imaging.\n3) Establish an analysis core that analyzes and integrates results from -omics, imaging and medical\ninformation, builds a spatiotemporal, multidimensional, integrative multi-omics cancer atlas, and develops\nlongitudinal and predictive models for PreCancer biology and progression, as well as data portal and\nvisualization framework.\n4) Establish multi-omics technologies on smaller number of samples.\n5) Perform a “multiscale deep data analysis” on a large number of samples (57) from a few people and a fewer\nnumber of samples (6) from many people. Use this information to guide additional data collection.\n6) Identify factors (e.g. germline genetics, microbiome, immune dysfunction) contributing to polyp\nheterogeneity between and across individuals. Build disease progression models based on these data.\n7) Make all biospecimens, information, protocols and software available to the PCA, HTAN and the general\nscientific community.\nWe expect our efforts will greatly facilitate understanding CRC at its earliest stages and serve as a model for\nunderstanding precancerous lesions of other solid tumor malignancies.	7 year old;APC gene;Adenocarcinoma;Adenomatous Polyposis Coli;Affect;Atlases;Automobile Driving;Benign;Biological Models;Biology;Cancer Etiology;Cause of Death;Cessation of life;Child;Colectomy;Collection;Colon Adenocarcinoma;Colon Carcinoma;Colonic Polyps;Colonoscopy;Colorectal Adenocarcinoma;Colorectal Cancer;Colorectal Polyp;Communities;Computer software;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease model;Epigenetic Process;Event;Evolution;Family;Gene Mutation;Genetic;Genomics;Health;Heterogeneity;Human;Image;Imaging technology;Immune System Diseases;Individual;Inherited;Integration Host Factors;Lead;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical;Medical Records;Metabolic;Metadata;Methylation;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Normal tissue morphology;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Pilot Projects;Polyps;Precancerous Polyp;Premalignant;Prevention strategy;Proteome;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Research Personnel;Sampling;Serum;Solid Neoplasm;Syndrome;System;Technology;Therapeutic;Tissue Sample;Tissues;United States;Whole Blood;base;collaborative approach;colon microbiome;colorectal cancer risk;cytokine;data portal;data visualization;epigenomics;experience;genome sequencing;lifetime risk;metabolome;microbiome;molecular imaging;multiple omics;novel;novel strategies;predictive modeling;prophylactic;spatiotemporal;transcriptome;treatment strategy;tumor;whole genome	STANFORD UNIVERSITY	STANFORD	CA	UNITED STATES	JAMES M.

Treatment strategies for AML have not changed in 30-40 years. Single-agent\ntargeted therapies based on AML genetics or microenvironmental disease features have been disappointing, at\nbest. The investigators on this DRSC Program, Drug Combinations to Circumvent Resistance (D2CR), have\ncollaborated for over a decade and have developed functional genomic pipelines for evaluation of primary AML\npatient samples that have collectively led to numerous discoveries with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.\nFor this Program, our long-term goals are to translate effective drug combinations that target tumor-\nintrinsic and microenvironmental pathways into the clinic for patients with AML. Our immediate goals\nare to prioritize the most relevant tumor-intrinsic and microenvironmental pathways for each AML\ndisease subset and establish sufficient preclinical data to facilitate immediate clinical investigation of\ndrug combinations. Based on the central hypothesis that drug combinations targeting tumor intrinsic\nand extrinsic features of AML biology will be essential to the development of more effective and\ndurable therapeutic strategies, we predict that the drug combinations established by this D2CR-DRSC\nProgram will substantially improve outcomes for patients with AML. To accomplish these goals, 3\nProjects are proposed: 1) What are the tumor-intrinsic genes and pathways that contribute to drug sensitivity\nand resistance? Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screens on parental and drug-resistant AML cells will be\nintegrated with computational analysis of the largest functional genomic AML cohort in the world. The result will\nnominate genes/pathways for validation on patient samples in gene-edited models and for drug combination\nstudies in Project 3. 2) What are the tumor-extrinsic pathways promoting tumor cell growth, drug resistance,\nand immune suppression? Inflammatory cytokine profiling of our large bank of AML patient samples will be\nconducted. Our bank of AML patient bone marrow stromal cells will also be accessed for studies of the reactive\nsignature of these stromal cells when exposed to specific drugs. Finally, high-parameter immunophenotyping\nand T-cell functional assays will be used to define the immune landscape with candidate drugs tested in an\nimmune-competent, spontaneous mouse model of AML. Candidate targets will be nominated for combination\nstudies with tumor-intrinsic targets. 3) What are the drug combinations that most effectively bridge tumor-\nintrinsic and microenvironmental biology to eliminate AML cells and circumvent resistance? Drug combinations\nfrom targets nominated in Project 1 and 2 will be tested ex vivo on primary AML patient samples and in vivo\nusing AML patient-derived xenografts. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a major\nimpact on our understanding of AML biology, with successful clinical translation of new, more effective drug\ncombination strategies.

Candidate targets will be nominated for combination\nstudies with tumor-intrinsic targets. 3) What are the drug combinations that most effectively bridge tumor-\nintrinsic and microenvironmental biology to eliminate AML cells and circumvent resistance? Drug combinations\nfrom targets nominated in Project 1 and 2 will be tested ex vivo on primary AML patient samples and in vivo\nusing AML patient-derived xenografts. Cumulatively, we expect these innovative analyses to have a major\nimpact on our understanding of AML biology, with successful clinical translation of new, more effective drug\ncombination strategies.

project	3U54CA224019-04S1	3U54CA224019-04S1	10411840	2021	Dissecting Single-cell Response or resistance to novel combination therapy in AML using mass cytometry	Project Summary (max 30 lines)\nWe developed an investigator-initiated clinical trial to test the combination or ruxolitinib and venetoclax\n(Rux+Ven) in relapse/refractory AML patients (NCT03874052) based upon extensive ex vivo small molecule\ninhibitor screening data collected from hundreds of primary AML samples. Preliminary trial results show the\ncombination is well tolerated with remissions obtained in some patients after a single cycle. Our collaborative\nproposal with Dr. Davis will make use of marrow and peripheral blood samples from trial patients that have been\ntreated ex vivo with each single agent and the drug combination along with single-cell resolution of mass\ncytometry (CyTOF). While CyTOF can address intratumoral heterogeneity for drug screening at the level of the\nsingle cell, the required analytics for the resulting complex data were not addressed. Leveraging the strengths\nof CyTOF and addressing the need for analysis approaches, Dr. Plevritis’ group developed a novel algorithm\n(DRUG-NEM) that analyzes single-cell, single-drug perturbation responses on individual leukemia cells to\nidentify optimized drug combination strategies for individual patients. The CyTOF analysis will examine AML\nphenotype, JAK-STAT signaling, BCL2 family proteins and cellular metabolism on individual cells from the\npatients treated on study. We hypothesize that by using DRUG-NEM we can predict response to combination\ntreatment based on in vitro response to single agent treatment. We will compare our predicted response to the\npatient’s actual response and determine cellular features associated with resistance to the combination. To\nidentify potential mechanisms of resistance we will perform cytokine assays on patient samples collected\nthroughout treatment. We hypothesize that cytokine signals emanating from the microenvironment could play a\nkey role in drug resistance in patients treated with Rux+Ven. If the DRUG-NEM predictions are accurate, it will\nprovide proof of concept for using single-agent drug data to inform combination therapy, thus, providing a more\nefficient and practical approach to study future combination treatments. If specific cytokines are found to\ncontribute to Rux+Ven resistance, approaches to overcome the resistance can be elucidated. Overall, our\nproposed supplement project makes use of our combined strengths to predict drug response and further\nunderstand mechanisms of drug resistance in AML patients. This application is being submitted to request\na supplemental budget for the Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center (DRSC) to perform the\ncollaborative work as proposed in Dr. Kara Davis’ administrative supplement application titled\n"Dissecting Single-Cell Response or Resistance to Novel Combination Therapy in AML Using Mass\nCytometry ” in response to NOT-CA-21-034 “Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Administrative\nSupplements to Support Collaborations with the NCI-supported Drug Resistance and Sensitivity\nNetwork (DRSN).

Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly-\nannotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The\nprimary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single\nagents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs\nor combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets\nof tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused\non non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative\nbreast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other\nhistologies. Over the past 9 years, both University of Texas MD Anderson (UTMDACC) and The University of\nUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) have established institution-wide efforts to generate\nnovel PDX models and perform preclinical testing. Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX\nmodels of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC,\nn=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases\nwhere there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We have characterized many tumor subtypes in our existing\nPDXs and plan to characterize many more with the ultimate goal of developing drug combinations in defined\ntumor subsets in a context that can lead to clinical trials which will validate the experimental results. We plan to\nfocus on NCI-IND agents that are primarily used by the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network. The\navailability of hundreds of PDXs of diverse histologic types and molecular profiles provides a unique opportunity\nfor synergistic interactions among the UTPDTC investigators, PDXNet, and ETCTN. Each Project will identify\nmolecular subtypes and then test with drugs targeted to putative pathways. Similar molecular subtype profiles\nwill be identified across projects and histologic classifications. This provides an opportunity to test the activity of\ndrugs targeting specific molecular pathways that may be active in several histologically distinct subtypes. Such\npan-histologic activity could greatly accelerate drug development. Our proposed studies focus on targeted\ntherapeutic agents for treatment of diseases and/or molecular subtypes that have unmet medical needs. The\nproposed studies are highly relevant to public health, as their success will lead to effective precision therapy for\ncancers, for which current therapies are ineffective.

Cumulatively the two institutions have hundreds of PDX\nmodels of different tumor types, including clinically-annotated models in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC,\nn=190 with 150 at UTMDACC and 40 at UTSW), colorectal cancer (CRC, n=127 models) pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma (PDAC, n=145 models), and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, n=44 models); four diseases\nwhere there is an urgent need for novel therapeutics. We have characterized many tumor subtypes in our existing\nPDXs and plan to characterize many more with the ultimate goal of developing drug combinations in defined\ntumor subsets in a context that can lead to clinical trials which will validate the experimental results. We plan to\nfocus on NCI-IND agents that are primarily used by the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network. The\navailability of hundreds of PDXs of diverse histologic types and molecular profiles provides a unique opportunity\nfor synergistic interactions among the UTPDTC investigators, PDXNet, and ETCTN. Each Project will identify\nmolecular subtypes and then test with drugs targeted to putative pathways. Similar molecular subtype profiles\nwill be identified across projects and histologic classifications. This provides an opportunity to test the activity of\ndrugs targeting specific molecular pathways that may be active in several histologically distinct subtypes. Such\npan-histologic activity could greatly accelerate drug development. Our proposed studies focus on targeted\ntherapeutic agents for treatment of diseases and/or molecular subtypes that have unmet medical needs. The\nproposed studies are highly relevant to public health, as their success will lead to effective precision therapy for\ncancers, for which current therapies are ineffective.

Our short-term goals are to establish a biobank of clinically, and molecularly-\nannotated PDXs and to use PDXs as a platform for preclinical drug development and biomarker discovery. The\nprimary goal for UTPDTC investigators will be to develop PDX trial strategies for preclinical testing of single\nagents and drug combinations. These models will allow the determination of the optimal treatments (single drugs\nor combinations) that should be tested in clinical trials in increasingly individualized, molecularly defined subsets\nof tumors. In this application we propose projects to prioritize the clinical testing of many targeted agents focused\non non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic cancer (PDAC), and triple negative\nbreast cancer (TNBC) tumor subtypes, as well as patients with selected genomic alterations across other\nhistologies.

project	1U54CA224068-01	1U54CA224068-01	9446211	2017	An integrated translational approach to overcome drug resistance	PROJECT SUMMARY (OVERALL)\nDrug resistance represents one of the most critical obstacles to clinical benefit for cancer patients. Due to the\nsize and complexity of this challenge, we believe a collaborative team approach is critical and have assembled\na team of drug resistance experts from three leading institutions (MGH, the Broad Institute, and MIT/Koch\nInstitute) with an exceptional track record of impactful discoveries in this field. We propose an integrated full-\nspectrum translational platform—including liquid biopsy, patient-derived tumor models, exome and\ntranscriptome sequencing of tumor tissue, rapid autopsy, functional genomic screens, innovative preclinical\nmouse models, and a high-throughput combination drug-screening platform covering the CTEP portfolio—to\naddress critical principles of drug resistance across several major cancer types—lung, melanoma and GI\ncancers, which impact a large percentage of cancer patients. Overall, these three projects will focus on the\ncommon theme of bypass resistance mechanisms, a critical ad frequent mechanism of therapeutic resistance\nthat can involve both genetic and adaptive resistance mechanisms that “bypass” the effects of therapy, and\nwhich can drive both intrinsic and acquired resistance. To maximize the potential impact on cancer patients we\nwill focus projects on three major tumor types—lung, melanoma and GI cancers—with each project integrating\nat least two tumor types. We will focus our projects on defining and overcoming key bypass resistance\nmechanisms to three of the most critical classes of cancer therapeutics: MAPK inhibitors, RTK inhibitors, and\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors. While each project will focus on a specific therapy and at least two specific\ncancer types, we believe the overall program design can be readily applied to additional agents and\nmolecularly-defined cancers, such that the ultimate impact of this work will go beyond the specific studies\nproposed and will serve as a “blueprint” for critical discoveries related to drug resistance. We anticipate that\nthese efforts will define a new standard in our mechanistic understanding of bypass resistance mechanisms\nand will lead to novel opportunities to overcome them in the clinic. Our proposed approach will provide a\nsteady stream of novel therapeutic strategies involving CTEP agents and pathways for evaluation in future\nclinical trials, as well as new potential agents for the CTEP portfolio. We have also integrated cutting-edge\nstrategies for real-time blood-based monitoring of response and resistance to help guide innovative trial\ndesign.

project	1U54CA224070-01	1U54CA224070-01	9446221	2017	Rational approaches to melanoma therapy	Project Summary – Overall\nThe outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma have improved dramatically over the last decade due to an\nimproved understanding of the molecular drivers of this disease. In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens\nhave been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas.\nThese treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof-\nof-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will\nprogress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been\nshown to be effective in patients with a wild-type BRAF. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments\nthat prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are\neffective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies,\nover the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical,\nhistological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of >450 PDX models represents one of the\nlargest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately\nrecapituluates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also\nincludes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been\nmaintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a\nrobust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we\npropose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued\nexpansion of our robutst melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical\ngaps in this disease. Project 1 will characterize kinase inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the\nPI3K-AKT pathway in combination with approved targeted therapies in PDX models in treatment-naïve and drug-\nresistant BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanomas. Project 2 will characterize targeting the apoptotic machinery of cancer\ncells as a combinatorial approach with MAPK pathway inhibitors in PDX with and without BRAFV600E/K mutations,\nincluding in subsets with aberrancies in anti-apoptotic genes. Both Projects will utilize baseline characteristics of the\nPDX models to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to guide personalized patient selection for\nfuture clinical testing. In addition, tumors will be analyzed for treatment-induced effects that correlate with sensitivity\nto identified resistance mechanisms and potential new combinatorial strategies. Finally, markers identified in the\npreclinical models will be compared to parallel biomarker studies of metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in\nclinical trials utilizing the same agents. These studies will be supported by the PDX, Bioinformatics, and\nAdministrative Cores to ensure their success, along with a Pilot Project program to open new areas of investigation.\nTogether these studies will have high potential to translate into new personalized clinical trials for patients.\n1	Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Area;BRAF gene;Bioinformatics;Biologic Characteristic;Biological Markers;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program;Cell Line;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collection;Cutaneous Melanoma;DNA;DNA Damage;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Drug resistance;Enrollment;Ensure;FDA approved;Fine needle aspiration biopsy;Foundations;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Heterogeneity;Heterogeneity;Histologic;Human;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immunodeficient Mouse;Immunotherapeutic agent;Institution;Investigation;Laboratories;Lesion;MAP Kinase Gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Melanoma Cell;Metastatic Melanoma;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Pathway interactions;Patient Selection;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Pilot Projects;Pre-Clinical Model;Property;Proteins;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;RNA;Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases;Regimen;Relapse;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Resources;Selection for Treatments;Signal Transduction;Solid;Specimen;Subgroup;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Translating;Tumor stage;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;cancer cell;combinatorial;disease heterogeneity;effective therapy;established cell line;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;kinase inhibitor;melanoma;multidisciplinary;mutant;novel drug combination;novel marker;novel therapeutic intervention;patient subsets;personalized medicine;personalized therapeutic;potential biomarker;prevent;programs;research clinical testing;resistance mechanism;response;success;targeted treatment;tool;tumor;tumor progression	WISTAR INSTITUTE	PHILADELPHIA	PA	UNITED STATES	Michael  Davies,Meenhard F Herlyn	Jeffrey Arnold Moscow	2885586	2885586	2017-09-25T04:00:00Z	2017-09-30T04:00:00Z	2019-08-31T04:00:00Z	RFA-CA-17-003

project	4U54CA224070-02	4U54CA224070-02	9985257	2019	Rational approaches to melanoma therapy	Project Summary – Overall\nThe outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma have improved dramatically over the last decade due to an\nimproved understanding of the molecular drivers of this disease. In particular, multiple targeted therapy regimens\nhave been approved for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas.\nThese treatments achieve clinical responses in ~80% of patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, thus providing proof-\nof-concept of the therapeutic potential for personalized therapeutic strategies. However, most of the patients will\nprogress within 2 years of starting those therapies. Further, currently there are no targeted therapies that have been\nshown to be effective in patients with a wild-type BRAF. Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments\nthat prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are\neffective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies,\nover the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical,\nhistological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of >450 PDX models represents one of the\nlargest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately\nrecapituluates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also\nincludes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been\nmaintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a\nrobust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we\npropose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued\nexpansion of our robutst melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical\ngaps in this disease. Project 1 will characterize kinase inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the\nPI3K-AKT pathway in combination with approved targeted therapies in PDX models in treatment-naïve and drug-\nresistant BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanomas. Project 2 will characterize targeting the apoptotic machinery of cancer\ncells as a combinatorial approach with MAPK pathway inhibitors in PDX with and without BRAFV600E/K mutations,\nincluding in subsets with aberrancies in anti-apoptotic genes. Both Projects will utilize baseline characteristics of the\nPDX models to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to guide personalized patient selection for\nfuture clinical testing. In addition, tumors will be analyzed for treatment-induced effects that correlate with sensitivity\nto identified resistance mechanisms and potential new combinatorial strategies. Finally, markers identified in the\npreclinical models will be compared to parallel biomarker studies of metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in\nclinical trials utilizing the same agents.

Thus, there are unmet clinical needs to develop treatments\nthat prevent or overcome resistance to existing therapies for patients with a BRAFV600E/K mutation, and that are\neffective in patients without a BRAF mutation. In order to facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies,\nover the last 5 years we have led a major effort to develop a broad collection of PDX models to reflect the clinical,\nhistological, and genetic heterogeneity of this disease. Our collection of >450 PDX models represents one of the\nlargest collections for any human malignancy, and our initial testing demonstrates that the collection accurately\nrecapituluates the oncogenic drivers and molecular heterogeneity that is observed in patients. This collection also\nincludes a subset of PDX established from patients with acquired resistance to targeted therapies that have been\nmaintained on those agents in vivo to sustain their resistant phenotype. Together these efforts have generated a\nrobust resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new personalized combinatorial therapies for patients. Thus, we\npropose to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional PDTC Program focused on the use and continued\nexpansion of our robutst melanoma PDX collection to identify new therapeutic approaches that fill important clinical\ngaps in this disease. Project 1 will characterize kinase inhibitors targeting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the\nPI3K-AKT pathway in combination with approved targeted therapies in PDX models in treatment-naïve and drug-\nresistant BRAFV600E/K-mutant melanomas. Project 2 will characterize targeting the apoptotic machinery of cancer\ncells as a combinatorial approach with MAPK pathway inhibitors in PDX with and without BRAFV600E/K mutations,\nincluding in subsets with aberrancies in anti-apoptotic genes. Both Projects will utilize baseline characteristics of the\nPDX models to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to guide personalized patient selection for\nfuture clinical testing. In addition, tumors will be analyzed for treatment-induced effects that correlate with sensitivity\nto identified resistance mechanisms and potential new combinatorial strategies. Finally, markers identified in the\npreclinical models will be compared to parallel biomarker studies of metastatic melanoma patients enrolled in\nclinical trials utilizing the same agents. These studies will be supported by the PDX, Bioinformatics, and\nAdministrative Cores to ensure their success, along with a Pilot Project program to open new areas of investigation.\nTogether these studies will have high potential to translate into new personalized clinical trials for patients.

Toward this goal, our PDTC focuses on testing drugs that are already available through the NCI\nas NCI-IND agents with the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). Scientifically,\nthis PDTC will focus on preclinical evaluation of approved and investigational drugs and drug\ncombinations in a large collection of breast PDX models representing primary and metastatic breast\ncancer. One project will screen 35 NCI-IND drugs as single agents and in combination with standard-\nof-care therapies, in >100 breast PDX models using a novel organoid system, and validate these\nresponses in PDX-bearing mice. Another project will test therapies that are predicted to target tumor-\ninitiating cell populations, with the goal of reducing chemotherapy resistance and recurrence – the major\ncause of death from breast cancer. These two synergistic research projects will be supported several\nkey Cores: a PDX Core to propagate the PDX models and run the drug studies; a Biostatistics and\nBioinformatics Core to identify molecular features of tumors that do (or do not) respond to various\ntreatments; a Pilot Projects and Trans-network Activities Core to foster exploration of new ideas within\nthe PDTC and in collaboration with the PDXNetwork (PDXNet); and an Administrative Core to facilitate\neffective communication within the PDTC and with the PDXNet. Taken together, these elements will\nconverge to reveal high-priority treatment strategies for future clinical trials in breast cancer patients.

project	5U54CA224076-04	5U54CA224076-04	10223224	2021	PDX Trial Center for Breast Cancer Therapy	Project Summary\nThe scientific premise of this Center is that breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models\nrepresent the diversity of human breast tumors, and can be feasibly utilized to test new drugs and drug\ncombinations to find therapeutic approaches that match with molecular features of various tumor types.\nThe goal of our PDX Development and Trials Center (PDTC) is to obtain preclinical data that will\nfacilitate prioritization of drugs to be tested in breast cancer clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute\n(NCI). Toward this goal, our PDTC focuses on testing drugs that are already available through the NCI\nas NCI-IND agents with the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN). Scientifically,\nthis PDTC will focus on preclinical evaluation of approved and investigational drugs and drug\ncombinations in a large collection of breast PDX models representing primary and metastatic breast\ncancer. One project will screen 35 NCI-IND drugs as single agents and in combination with standard-\nof-care therapies, in >100 breast PDX models using a novel organoid system, and validate these\nresponses in PDX-bearing mice. Another project will test therapies that are predicted to target tumor-\ninitiating cell populations, with the goal of reducing chemotherapy resistance and recurrence – the major\ncause of death from breast cancer. These two synergistic research projects will be supported several\nkey Cores: a PDX Core to propagate the PDX models and run the drug studies; a Biostatistics and\nBioinformatics Core to identify molecular features of tumors that do (or do not) respond to various\ntreatments; a Pilot Projects and Trans-network Activities Core to foster exploration of new ideas within\nthe PDTC and in collaboration with the PDXNetwork (PDXNet); and an Administrative Core to facilitate\neffective communication within the PDTC and with the PDXNet. Taken together, these elements will\nconverge to reveal high-priority treatment strategies for future clinical trials in breast cancer patients.

Despite remarkable improvements in survival with next generation AR\npathway inhibitors such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, CRPC patients ultimately progress and die from\ntheir disease. Our understanding of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to AR therapy has increased\ndramatically in recent years, largely based on genomic landscape analyses of tumors from CRPC patients and\npreclinical studies of acquired resistance in patient-derived models (organoids, PDX). Much of this progress is\ndirectly linked to the members of this Drug Resistance and Sensitivity Center (DRSC) team. A major\nmechanistic insight from these studies is the recognition of two categories of AR therapy resistance: one in\nwhich AR pathway signaling is restored and the other in which it remains inhibited. Underlying both categories\nare a heterogeneous set of resistance mechanisms, many of which were discovered by our DRSC team\nmembers. Importantly, we have shown that several of these resistance mechanisms can be targeted with\ncurrent clinical grade drugs. The overarching goal of this DRSC proposal is to evaluate these translational\nopportunities across a unique set of preclinical organoid and PDX models (again, discovered and developed by\nour DRSC team members) and to catalyze the initiation of clinical studies in patients most likely to benefit\nbased on appropriate biomarker profiles. We address this goal in three Projects. Project 1 focuses on\nresistance caused by restored AR pathway function, which occurs in over ~50% of CRPC patients, by targeting\nthe glucocorticoid receptor, which is upregulated and substitutes for AR, or by further inhibition of AR signaling\nusing drugs targeting specific components of the chromatin machinery. Project 2 will take a similar approach\nbut will focus on the opposite category of acquired resistance (absence of restored AR pathway activity),\nleveraging insights from our recent data showing that cancer can revert from an AR-negative to AR-positive\nstate by targeting specific chromatin modifiers. Project 3 integrates with Projects 1 and 2 by focusing on\nkinase inhibitors as an adjunct to AR pathway therapy in two distinct contexts – PI3K/AKT activation in tumors\nwith PTEN loss and FGFR activation in tumors with autocrine FGF8/FGF9 production. Excitingly, a recent\nclinical trial of combined AKT and AR inhibition, which was initiated based on our earlier work, demonstrated a\nsignificant improvement in survival for patients with PTEN loss prostate cancer. The Administrative Core will\noversee the integration of the Projects with each other, with NCI scientific staff and with other DRSCs.\nCollectively our studies will validate various combination therapy regimens, in conjunction with molecular\nbiomarkers for patient selection, as a critical step toward clinical translation. In addition, the drugs and targets\nstudied here are broadly relevant for multiple cancer types.

This translational approach will be part of the NCI's Drug\nResistance and Sensitivity Centers Network to develop innovative strategies to understand and combat\nmechanisms of tumor resistance and exploit tumor sensitivity to anti-cancer therapies.\n To accomplish this, BATAR-UP will support two projects and one core driven by a multidisciplinary\nteam of investigators at UCSF and Stanford University. Project 1 will define and interrogate the molecular and\ncellular basis of residual disease in lung cancers treated with targeted inhibitors in clinical use. We will prioritize\nfor initial study both EGFR-mutant and ALK gene rearrangement positive lung cancers, given their importance\nas key molecular disease subtypes and our prior published work and expertise. We will harness genetic and\ntranscriptomic analysis of clinical samples (liquid and tumor biopsies) to provide a molecular view of the\nevolution of response, residual disease, and acquired resistance. We will generate organoid and PDX models\nand apply cutting-edge functional screens (genetic, pharmacologic, and targeted proteomic assays) to identify\nkey vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited, including with CTEP agents. This systematic\napproach will allow us to reveal the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that drives EGFR\nand ALK inhibitor resistance and pinpoint therapeutic strategies to intercept the evolution of residual disease\nand eventual acquired resistance. Project 2 will define and interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of\nresistance and residual disease in lung cancers treated with current immunotherapies, including PD-1 and PD-\nL1 antibodies. Leveraging shared platforms in synergy with Project 1, we will perform systematic analyses of\nliquid and tumor biopsy specimens (and ex vivo models) obtained from patients longitudinally before and\nduring treatment and upon acquired resistance. We will focus our studies on EGFR and ALK wild type patients,\nincluding squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma patients where immunotherapy has shown efficacy\nbut is typically non-curative. We will leverage (1) a novel lung cancer organoid model wherein tumor biopsies\nare cultured as both tumor epithelium and their endogenous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) en bloc as a\ncohesive unit, and (2) deep droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Our systematic approach will help\ndefine the basis of the incomplete response and residual disease that contributes to immunotherapy resistance\nand identify potential new therapeutic strategies to help convert these incomplete responses into curative\noutcomes. Our Administrative Core will provide leadership, coordination and oversight for BATAR-UP with\nthe overarching goal of synergizing the research conducted in the 2 Projects and the entire DRSC network.

Building on our strength and existing infrastructure, we propose\nto establish the Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center (WU-PDTC), as part of PDXNet\nprogram, to promote preclinical testing in a collaborative nation-wide effort.\nThe PDX core within WU-PDTC will develop and characterize at least 1000 new pathogen-free PDX models\nacross major tumor types. The PDX models will be genomically and phenotypically characterized using the\nlatest `omics technologies and expertly analyzed using the most current data analysis pipelines that have been\ndeployed for other large scale NCI programs. The Bioinformatics Core will integrate these analyzes with clinical\nannotation from the originating patient to include patient treatment history and tumor response (Aim 1). Our two\nresearch projects will conduct PDX clinical trials using single agent and combinational agents using drugs\nunder NCI-IND (Aim 2). Project 1 will test pan- or beta isoform specific class I PI3K inhibitors in over 100\nbreast PDX models while Project 2 will study combinatorial approaches that overcome tumor intrinsic and\nextrinsic mechanisms to ERK inhibition in over 100 already available pancreatic PDX models. Proteogenomic\nand clinical response data will be collected in these models, as part of a broader effort of characterizing PDX\nmodels and conducting clinical correlation and treatment response analyses by the Bioinformatics Core (Aim\n3). All relevant information, including proteogenomic features of PDX models and treatment/response history,\nwill be tracked in a dedicated relational database that will be accessible to PDXNet and PDMR-FNLCR. The\ngoal is to identify candidates for human clinical trials for the ET-CTN. In Aim 4, the WU-PDTC will leverage\nexisting expertise and programs from the NCI-designated Comprehensive Siteman Cancer Center, Institute of\nClinical and Translational Research (ITCS), McDonnell Genome Institute, Mallinkrodt Imaging Research\nCenter, and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN) to support the goals of developing and utilizing\nPDX models to test and improve cancer treatment, in collaboration with other components of the PDXNet.\nFinally, WU-PDTC, through coordination by the Administration Core, will support pilot research projects\nutilizing the PDX resources and fostering collaboration across PDTCs, PNMR-FNLCR, and other NCI\nprograms. The goal is to increase the spectrum of agents tested in PDX clinical trials and to improve the\nreliability, validation, utility, and standardization of PDX models through innovative Cross-PDXNet research.\nOur demonstrated capability in generating and utilizing PDX models, extensive existing infrastructure, and\nstrong institutional commitment set a solid foundation for a successful PDTC that will help achieve goals set by\nNCI in advancing the use of PDX models in preclinical testing.

project	3U54CA224083-03S2	3U54CA224083-03S2	10371645	2021	Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center	Project Summary\n This application is being submitted in response to the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) PA-\n20-272. This supplemental proposal seeks to uncover the mechanism of synergy and develop an optimized\nregimen of the combination of a microtubule-disrupting agent, eribulin, and a PI3K-inhibitor in patient-derived\nxenograft (PDX) models of breast cancer. The work will be conducted as a national collaboration between\nWashington University in St. Louis and BIDMC/Harvard Medical School in Boston. In her pre-clinical work, Dr.\nMa at Washington University in St. Louis has shown that the combination of eribulin and the PI3K-inhibitor\ncopanlisib greatly extends progression-free survival in eight PDX models of triple negative breast cancer\n(TNBC). This novel concept is now being carried forward into a clinical trial in patients with metastatic TNBC\n(NCT04345913). Her discovery was surprising as PI3K-inhibitor benefit so far had been restricted to\nER+PIK3CAmt breast cancer. The exact mechanism and, based on the mechanism, best timing of eribulin and\nPI3K-inhibitor will be determined in the proposed work. This supplemental award will extend the work in\nResearch Project 1 in testing PI3K inhibitor combinations in breast cancer PDX models and to uncover\nmechanisms of synergy for the combination of microtubule disrupting agent, eribulin, and the PI3K inhibitor,\ncopanlisib.\n Dr. Wulf's Parent R01 Proposal entitled “Novel Uses for PI3K-inhibitors for the Treatment of Advanced\nPIK3CA-mutant Breast Cancer (1R01CA226776)” is slated to develop PI3K-inhibitor (PI3Ki) combinations for\npatients with PIK3CAmutant breast cancer. PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer can be targeted with alpelisib, a\nrecent FDA-approved PI3K-an inhibitor now widely used in the metastatic setting in conjunction with estrogen\nreceptor blockade. In this project, we hypothesize that PI3K-inhibition is a metabolic intervention that, if applied\nstrategically following microtubule disruption, can deepen and prolong remissions obtained with microtubule\ndisrupting drugs, which are widely used to treat metastatic breast cancer. We will employ in vitro imaging and\nmetabolomic studies and in vivo imaging with 18FDG-glucose and 13C-pyruvate to deep-probe glycolysis in\nresponse to chemotherapy, PI3K-inhibition and their combination and test if these imaging modalities can\npredict responses. The team at WashU (Dr. Cynthia Ma, medical oncology and preclinical mouse work, Dr.\nKooresh Shogi (quantitative PET-imaging), Dr. Cornelius von Morze (quantitative MRI imaging) and at\nBIDMC/Boston (Dr. Gerburg Wulf, pre-clinical mechanistic studies and Dr. Aaron Grant, pioneer in 13C-\npyruvate imaging) have established a MTA for transfer of the PDX models and will conference bi-monthly to\nmake this supplemental project happen within a year.

Proteogenomic\nand clinical response data will be collected in these models, as part of a broader effort of characterizing PDX\nmodels and conducting clinical correlation and treatment response analyses by the Bioinformatics Core (Aim\n3). All relevant information, including proteogenomic features of PDX models and treatment/response history,\nwill be tracked in a dedicated relational database that will be accessible to PDXNet and PDMR-FNLCR. The\ngoal is to identify candidates for human clinical trials for the ET-CTN. In Aim 4, the WU-PDTC will leverage\nexisting expertise and programs from the NCI-designated Comprehensive Siteman Cancer Center, Institute of\nClinical and Translational Research (ITCS), McDonnell Genome Institute, Mallinkrodt Imaging Research\nCenter, and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN) to support the goals of developing and utilizing\nPDX models to test and improve cancer treatment, in collaboration with other components of the PDXNet.\nFinally, WU-PDTC, through coordination by the Administration Core, will support pilot research projects\nutilizing the PDX resources and fostering collaboration across PDTCs, PNMR-FNLCR, and other NCI\nprograms. The goal is to increase the spectrum of agents tested in PDX clinical trials and to improve the\nreliability, validation, utility, and standardization of PDX models through innovative Cross-PDXNet research.\nOur demonstrated capability in generating and utilizing PDX models, extensive existing infrastructure, and\nstrong institutional commitment set a solid foundation for a successful PDTC that will help achieve goals set by\nNCI in advancing the use of PDX models in preclinical testing.

project	1U54CA231630-01A1	1U54CA231630-01A1	9833682	2019	Defining and targeting the molecular vulnerabilities of the PAX3-FOXO1 protein in rhabdomyosarcoma	ABSTRACT – Overall (revised)\nFusion-positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) remains one of the most fatal but least understood cancers of childhood. The driving oncoprotein in ARMS is the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein, a chimeric transcription factor that hijacks normal gene expression and chromatin state. Five-year survival for children with PAX3-FOXO1- positive ARMS is ~30% for all-comers, and <10% when metastatic. Despite the discovery of PAX3-FOXO1 in 1993, treatment strategies for affected children remain unchanged. This deficiency stems equally from a lack of understanding of the basic biology of the disease and an inability to directly target the fusion protein. No systematic or comprehensive approach has been undertaken to identify the proteins and regulatory elements required to support PAX3-FOXO1-mediated tumorigenesis. As a result, the field has been limited to a patchwork of data with no unified scientific strategy. To overcome this, this FusOnC2 Center has an innovative team and dynamic environment in which data interpretation is informed by complementary technological approaches and by biological and clinical knowledge. This comprehensive approach will transform understanding of PAX3-FOXO1-mediated oncogenesis and create opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The Center’s overarching goal is to advance the therapeutic tractability of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein in ARMS by comprehensively identifying the druggable co-regulators, modulators, and intrinsic activities of PAX3-FOXO1. To accomplish this goal, the Center includes two complementary Projects, each led by expert RMS biologists paired with specialists in pioneering experimental approaches undertaking the most cutting-edge research in cancer biology, genomics, proteomics, structural biology, and medicinal chemistry. The Projects will be supported by RMS investigators within each project who will provide curated RMS cell lines, unique human primary RMS tumor cells, and murine models to enable rapid in vitro and in vivo validation and cross-prioritization of targets. An Administrative Core will integrate and coordinate the Center components, providing leadership and oversight, and promoting cross-pollination of ideas and resources. The Overall Specific Aims are to: (1) define and target the PAX3-FOXO1 interactome; and (2) perform chemical probe discovery for PAX3-FOXO1 to create additional tools for investigating the fundamental biology and tractability of PAX3-FOXO1 and fusion-positive RMS. Approaches used include proximity labeling, saturation mutagenesis, single and combinatorial CRISPR screens, high-throughput phenotypic assays, and mechanistically unbiased approaches to chemical probe discovery using novel high-throughput binding assays. We will use information gleaned to prioritize targets and agents for validation and to inform compound optimization and PROTAC preparation. This Center’s strengths and resources will synergize with the FusOnC2 Consortium, speeding development of knowledge generalizable to the biology of multiple fusion oncoproteins in childhood cancers, accelerating advances in clinical care.

Translation of molecular understanding of sarcoma\npathophysiology into effective new drugs in the clinic is a complex, risky proposition that requires the coordinated\nefforts of a talented team of individuals with complementary skills. This group brings expertise in Ewing sarcoma\nbiology and the EWS-ETS oncoproteins, epigenetics and transcription, structural biology, computational biology,\nchemical biology and drug development, mouse models, preclinical experimental therapeutics, and clinical trials\ndevelopment. A Center mechanism is essential to the success of this proposal. No one institution nor individual\ncan bring mastery of the diversity of approaches, technologies, and scientific domains needed to achieve the\ngoals of this proposal. We have elected to focus on understanding the fundamental inner workings of Ewing\nsarcoma from its transcriptional circuits, to the direct protein interactions with EWS-FLI1, to the direct and\nimmediate effects of EWS-FLI1 degradation. Moreover, a strong emphasis of this proposal is on target\nidentification and preclinical validation, critical steps in the process of bringing forward therapies with optimal\nchances for success in the clinic. The team that is assembled has all of the component pieces needed for\nsuccess. Our Center includes outstanding basic cancer biologists, chemists, computational biologists, and\ntranslational researchers, and five pediatric oncologists. Thus, the proposed Center can catalyze basic discovery\nand clinical translation by leveraging basic and clinical research talent within the Center and our strong ties to\noutside academic and industrial partners.

This Center’s mission is tightly aligned with that of the larger Consortium on Fusion Oncoproteins in Childhood Cancers and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative. A major impetus for the development of this Consortium has been the growing knowledge that fusion oncoproteins that are pathognomonic for specific cancer types often function via disruption of the structure and/or activity of protein complexes that govern chromatin architecture and hence gene control. We have shown that at least two of the fusion oncoproteins highlighted as major areas of emphasis within the Consortium, SS18-SSX and EWS-FLI1, bind and act via BAF complexes to drive cancer-specific oncogenic gene expression. Importantly, genetic studies across human cancer types have indicated that genes encoding encoding mSWI/SNF complex subunits are among the most frequently mutated, at over 20% of all human cancers, further underscoring the need for a detailed understanding of BAF complex structure, topology and mechanisms on chromatin. \nOur multi-institutional collaborative network seeks to comprehensively interrogate biologic mechanisms underpinning the function of the SS18-SSX oncogenic fusion protein in synovial sarcoma and to use the approaches and the results generated to launch targeted therapeutic discovery campaigns that are directly linked to the mechanisms identified. Specifically, our approach encompasses three major areas: (1) BAF complex genomic targeting, gene regulation, and chromatin state interactions, including interactions with other chromatin regulators; (2) Understanding the role of the wild-type SS18 protein, its protein-level regulation, and mechanisms by which its stabilization can reverse SS18-SSX-mediated BAF complex activity and be exploited for therapeutic benefit; (3) Mechanistically characterizing synovial sarcoma-specific vulnerabilities, centered in chromatin-bound protein complexes and related pathways. The highly integrative nature of the PI-directed research projects and expertise within collaborator laboratories provide the strongest possible likelihood that the aims will be successfully achieved and that novel therapeutic strategies will emerge from this Center.

This Center’s mission is tightly aligned with that of the larger Consortium on Fusion\nOncoproteins in Childhood Cancers as well as the goals of the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative. Indeed,\nowing in part to our group’s recent findings surrounding the discovery of SS18-SSX as a stable and integrated\nmember of the mammalian SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin remodeling complex, a major impetus for the\ndevelopment of this Consortium has been the growing knowledge that pediatric fusion oncoproteins that\nare pathognomonic for specific cancer types often function via disruption of the structure and/or activity of\nprotein complexes that govern chromatin architecture and hence gene control. We have shown that at least\ntwo of the fusion oncoproteins highlighted as major areas of emphasis within the Consortium, SS18-SSX\nand EWS-FLI1, act specifically through BAF complexes to drive their cancer-specific oncogenic gene\nexpression patterns. Study of multimeric BAF complexes and their functions, structure, and interactions are\nfurther suggested by genetic studies across human cancer types which have indicated that among all\nchromatin remodeling complexes, genes encoding mSWI/SNF complex subunits are among the most\nfrequently mutated, at over 20% of all human cancers.\nHere we present a multi-institutional, highly collaborative and multidisciplinary approach to comprehensively\ninterrogate biologic mechanisms underpinning the function of the SS18-SSX oncogenic fusion in synovial\nsarcoma and to use each of these approaches and the results generated to launch targeted therapeutic\ndiscovery campaigns that are directly linked to the mechanisms identified. Specifically, our approach\nencompasses three major areas: (1) BAF complex targeting, gene regulation, and chromatin state; (2)\nUnderstanding the role of the wild-type SS18 protein in the context of the SS18-SSX fusion, its protein-level\nregulation, and mechanisms by which its stabilization can be exploited for therapeutic benefit; (3) Using\ngenome-scale genetic perturbation strategies to discover and mechanistically characterize SS-specific\nvulnerabilities, especially those in chromatin-bound protein complexes and related pathways. As a Center,\nthe unique expertise of each PI and the highly integrative nature of the research projects, cores, and\ncollaborators provide the strongest possible likelihood that the aims will be successfully achieved and that\nnovel therapeutic strategies will emerge from this Center.

project	1U54CA231641-01	1U54CA231641-01	9600275	2018	An integrated approach to analyze and target EWS/FLI in Ewing sarcoma	Overall Section Summary/Abstract\nThe overarching goal of our FusOnC2 TEST (Targeting the Ewing Sarcoma Translocation) Center is to develop a new mechanistic understanding of EWS/FLI that will allow for the development of new therapeutic approaches for Ewing sarcoma based on inhibiting EWS/FLI.  EWS/FLI is an aberrant oncogenic transcription factor formed by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) chromosomal translocation that is the driver oncoprotein of this tumor.  Multiple independent studies demonstrate a critical dependence of Ewing sarcoma cells on EWS/FLI such that blockade of the translocation is associated with a loss of proliferation, loss of cell cycle progression and ultimately reversal of oncogenic transformation.  Thus, most investigators believe that inhibition of EWS/FLI in the clinic would be the best way to treat patients with Ewing sarcoma.  \n\nTraditional chemical design of EWS/FLI inhibitors has proven challenging because the molecule does not contain traditionally “druggable” pockets.  We therefore hypothesize that a deeper scientific understanding of EWS/FLI transcriptional function in Ewing sarcoma will allow for identification of new agents.\n\nThe FusOnC2 TEST Center will focus on two critical molecular features of EWS/FLI required for its transcriptional and oncogenic function:  (i) binding of EWS/FLI to GGAA-microsatellites and related DNA response elements, and (ii) EWS/FLI self-association activities to form “hubs” that coordinate protein-interactions through low-complexity domains to mediate transcriptional function.\n\nTargeting EWS/FLI requires diverse expertise to be focused on this problem.  The TEST Center is designed to facilitate both independent and highly-focused studies on critical components of EWS/FLI function, while at the same time interacting with the entire FusOnC2 consortium to share new knowledge, techniques, and expertise that will help facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches to Ewing sarcoma.  We believe that the TEST Center will contribute greatly to the overall success of the FusOnC2 Consortium, and help to change the paradigm for how new therapies are developed for pediatric translocation-associated cancers.

project	1U54CA231649-01A1	1U54CA231649-01A1	9834547	2019	Targeting EWSR1-FLI1 through Functional, Structural and Chemical Approaches	Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone and soft tissue malignancy in children and adolescents. The\nfive-year survival of Ewing sarcoma patients is 70%, and falls to less than 20% for those with metastatic\ndisease, a situation that has not improved despite many years of increasingly intensive chemotherapy\nregimens. Survivors of Ewing sarcoma often suffer long-term deleterious effects of treatment. An immediate\nneed exists for the development of effective, targeted therapies with decreased toxicity. Molecularly, Ewing\nsarcoma is characterized by one of several reciprocal chromosomal translocations that fuse a FET family\nprotein with an ETS transcription factor, the most common of which is EWSR1-FLI1. The EWSR1-FLI1 fusion\nprotein is completely specific to Ewing sarcoma tumor cells, and thus presents an ideal target for novel\ntherapeutics. To date, however, no such targeted therapy has become clinically available, owing to 4 major\nknowledge gaps. First, there is a dearth of robust in vitro model systems for functional studies of EWSR1-FLI1.\nKnockdown studies in Ewing sarcoma cell lines can give inconsistent results, and few primary cell types\ntolerate exogenous EWSR1-FLI1 expression. Second, the protein encoded by the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion is a\ntranscription factor, and there is widespread perception that such proteins are “undruggable”. Third, lead\ncandidates of small-molecule screens reported to date have either not been shown to have a mechanistic link\nto EWSR1-FLI1, or fail to replicate the phenotype of Ewing sarcoma cells depleted of EWSR1-FLI1 activity.\nFourth, the field has lacked relevant animal models for functional genomics and preclinical testing. Developing\ntargeted therapy for Ewing sarcoma will require an integrated approach executed by an experienced team. Our\nstrategy is based on several fundamentals, namely 1) systems to specifically deplete and reconstitute the\nEWSR1-FLI1 protein in cells; 2) an understanding of the structural biochemistry of low-complexity (LC)\ndomains found in EWSR1 and related proteins; and 3) novel in vivo models of Ewing sarcoma for functional\ngenomics and drug testing. Standing on this foundation, we will perform biochemical and genetic experiments\nto identify the binding partners and functional effectors of EWSR1-FLI1 and dissect its mechanisms of\ntranscriptional activation. We will use our experimental systems to conduct phenotypic and target-based high-\nthroughput screens. Finally, we are well-positioned to perform the work required to transform a compound with\npromising initial activity into a preclinical drug lead. Our approach to drug discovery is built upon medicinal\nchemistry coupled with secondary assays that maximize potency and specificity of lead compounds. We will\nperform target identification for lead compounds using strategies our team has successfully used for several\nagents currently in active preclinical development. A dedicated preclinical pharmacology core, highly integrated\nwith the projects and with the high throughput screening core and medicinal chemistry core, will ensure\noptimization of delivery, PK/PD and toxicity properties of the most promising lead compounds.

Among the FusOnC2 consortium cancers of interest, synovial sarcoma has the highest incidence in\nthe United States and worldwide, but has been a specifically underserved malignancy due to its predilection for\nthe adolescent and young adult population and its relatively poor responsiveness to systemic therapy,\ncompared to other pediatric sarcomas that also associate with fusion oncogenes. While much of the biology of\nSS18-SSX remains unknown and synovial sarcoma patients represent a clearly underserved, orphan-disease\npopulation, there are two principles at the extremes of the cancer biology spectrum that are well established.\nFirst, SS18-SSX has proven the capacity to recapitulate synovial sarcomagenesis faithfully in the mouse\nwithout the need of introduced or stochastically acquired secondary genetic changes, second SS18-SSX has\nbiochemically demonstrated interactions with an important chromatin remodeling complex called SWI/SNF or\nBAF. This application proposes to build three research projects focused on the cell biology of transformation,\ngenome-wide chromatin biology and SWI/SNF (BAF) complex componentry biology, each related to SS18-\nSSX. These discovery biology and therapeutic target identification efforts will be supported by two shared\nresource cores that will provide human validation of therapeutic targets and preclinical testing of therapeutic\nstrategies. The group of investigators has developed as an organically assembled network of collaborations,\nbuilt over the last decade, during which time each project has gathered substantial preliminary data using a\nvariety of functional screens, a newly identified cell of origin, the ability to track SS18-SSX genome wide\nlocalization and protein interactions, a powerful system to produce and evaluate recombinant SWI/SNF (BAF)\ncomplexes with variable componentry, and powerful mouse genetic models of synovial sarcoma—including\nspontaneous development of metastatic disease. Preliminary data are sufficiently robust to recommend\ntherapeutic strategies immediately from each research project for the cores to validate and evaluate in clinically\nrelevant mouse models and quantitative molecular imaging.

project	1U54CA232568-01	1U54CA232568-01	9617113	2018	Discovery and Development of Optimal Immunotherapeutic Strategies for Childhood Cancers	OVERALL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\n There is a major paradox confronting the field of childhood cancer research. Several decades ago,\npioneering investigators focused on children with cancer led a revolution resulting in previously incurable\nmalignancies becoming curable. In contrast, over the last two decades, basic science has continued to\nadvance fundamental understanding of the oncogenesis of pediatric cancers, but cure rates for most pediatric\nmalignancies have plateaued, and the field has witnessed first-hand that current standard therapies often\nsaddle survivors with life threatening therapy-induced morbidities. It is sobering that for most children who\nsuffer relapse, few if any novel therapeutic options exist, and most patients receive the same type of therapy\nthat failed them in the first place. The funding opportunity arising out of the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot\ninitiative directly addresses this paradox by forming a Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery and Development\nNetwork (PI-DDN). Immunotherapy for B-ALL and neuroblastoma is now credentialed, with CD19 directed\nimmunotherapies showing unprecedented activity in highly refractory cases of lymphoid malignancies. The\nfield is now poised for a focused and sustained multi-disciplinary effort to extend these early successes, and\nrethink our approach to childhood cancer therapy in general. Here, we propose a pediatric immuno-oncology\nCenter entitled Discovery and Development of Optimal Immunotherapeutic Strategies for Childhood\nCancers. We envision this Center providing a central hub for the PI-DDN, creating additional opportunities for\nmulti-disciplinary research with the common goal of creating new cancer immunotherapies for children. This\nCenter embodies three highly integrated multi-institutional Projects supported by a single Administrative and\nStatistical Core. The overarching hypothesis to be tested here is that childhood cancers harbor lineage-specific\nmechanisms of oncogenesis and immune evasion that can be precisely and effectively targeted by rationally\ndesigned and developed immunotherapeutic regimens. Project 1 will discover lineage specific cell surface\nmolecules that have project-defined optimal attributes for synthetic immunotherapeutic based targeting, and\nuse this to create and credential new therapeutics based upon preclinical efficacy in high-risk childhood cancer\nmodels. Project 2 will focus on major mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance by developing approaches to\ncircumvent the fundamental issues of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity and T cell dysfunction due to both\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors.

Several decades ago,\npioneering investigators focused on children with cancer led a revolution resulting in previously incurable\nmalignancies becoming curable. In contrast, over the last two decades, basic science has continued to\nadvance fundamental understanding of the oncogenesis of pediatric cancers, but cure rates for most pediatric\nmalignancies have plateaued, and the field has witnessed first-hand that current standard therapies often\nsaddle survivors with life threatening therapy-induced morbidities. It is sobering that for most children who\nsuffer relapse, few if any novel therapeutic options exist, and most patients receive the same type of therapy\nthat failed them in the first place. The funding opportunity arising out of the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot\ninitiative directly addresses this paradox by forming a Pediatric Immunotherapy Discovery and Development\nNetwork (PI-DDN). Immunotherapy for B-ALL and neuroblastoma is now credentialed, with CD19 directed\nimmunotherapies showing unprecedented activity in highly refractory cases of lymphoid malignancies. The\nfield is now poised for a focused and sustained multi-disciplinary effort to extend these early successes, and\nrethink our approach to childhood cancer therapy in general. Here, we propose a pediatric immuno-oncology\nCenter entitled Discovery and Development of Optimal Immunotherapeutic Strategies for Childhood\nCancers. We envision this Center providing a central hub for the PI-DDN, creating additional opportunities for\nmulti-disciplinary research with the common goal of creating new cancer immunotherapies for children. This\nCenter embodies three highly integrated multi-institutional Projects supported by a single Administrative and\nStatistical Core. The overarching hypothesis to be tested here is that childhood cancers harbor lineage-specific\nmechanisms of oncogenesis and immune evasion that can be precisely and effectively targeted by rationally\ndesigned and developed immunotherapeutic regimens. Project 1 will discover lineage specific cell surface\nmolecules that have project-defined optimal attributes for synthetic immunotherapeutic based targeting, and\nuse this to create and credential new therapeutics based upon preclinical efficacy in high-risk childhood cancer\nmodels. Project 2 will focus on major mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance by developing approaches to\ncircumvent the fundamental issues of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity and T cell dysfunction due to both\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors. Project 3 will focus on a major difference between pediatric and many adult\nmalignancies, with pediatric cancers typically eliciting little adaptive immunity, and develop approaches to\nenhance adaptive immune responses against pediatric cancer-specific antigenic targets.

In addition, these minority populations remain underrepresented in therapeutic clinical\ntrials. Our Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (M-PDTC) provides a unique\nopportunity to help address these racial/ethnic disparities. This Center is built on the scientific premise that,\nin addition to important socioeconomic factors, health disparities that burden racial/ethnic minorities in\nthe US are linked to poorly understood genetic and other intrinsic factors. We propose to leverage the\nhigh numbers of minority cancer patients at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in order to generate and\nutilize innovative PDX models of diverse racial/ethnic minority origin, which will assist the entire scientific\ncommunity delineate the molecular underpinnings of cancer of racial/ethnic minority origin. Houston is the most\ndiverse large US city, with ~20% of its residents being African American (AA) and ~40% Hispanic. BCM faculty\nare responsible for clinical care at two major teaching hospitals that serve large minority populations: Ben Taub\nHospital (BTH), a public hospital (91% of patients are minorities), and the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center\n(MEDVAMC), one of the largest VA Medical Centers in the US, which serves over 100,000 veterans in Southeast\nTexas (~30% are AA). Thus, there is a very large population of minority cancer patients available for potential\ntissue donations. BCM has a long track record of successfully enrolling minority patients in clinical trials.\nIn addition to our large AA patient population at BCM, 59% of patients at BTH are of Hispanic ethnicity. We have\nassembled a multidisciplinary and multi-institutional collaborative team, bringing together experts in PDX model\ngeneration, molecular biology and signaling pathways, animal drug treatment studies, pathology and clinical\nmanagement of prostate and breast cancer from BCM and MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). We are\nideally positioned to leverage the technical resources of our institutions and our high numbers of racial and ethnic\nminority cancer patients at BCM, in order to support the broader goals of the M-PDTC RFA, in particular to\nfacilitate biospecimen donations from these populations and increase the racial and ethnic diversity of the\nPDXNet repository in a wide spectrum of cancers, as well as to support the Specific Aims of our two research\nprojects in prostate and breast cancer. Few, if any, cancer centers have this combination of an outstanding\nresearch base, large numbers of African American, Hispanic and Asian cancer patients, and BCM’s robust track\nrecord of successfully enrolling minority patients from our catchment area (Houston) into clinical trials. Moreover,\nour two research projects will utilize whole exome sequencing (WES), global RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq),\nquantitative proteomic (qKiP) and metabolomic profiling and will conduct preclinical trials of promising NCI-IND\ndrugs to uncover novel, effective treatment strategies for prostate and breast cancer in minority populations.

We have established an accomplished\ntransdisciplinary research team with an outstanding infrastructure that includes a University of California-wide\ncentral IRB system called Reliance and strong preliminary data to support the proposed PDX and cancer\ndisparities research, thus allowing our results to be easily translated to clinical trials.

Our collective strengths include complementary expertise in PDX\ndevelopment and drug testing, cancer health disparities, and clinical trial development robustly supported by\ncores for PDX, Pilot Studies, Bioinformatics, and Administration. We will achieve our goal through two\nResearch Projects. Project 1 - Characterizing Treatment Responses with PDX Models for Gastric and Liver\nTumors, specifically addresses cancer health disparities in gastric cancers (GC) and liver cancers (LC) that\ndisproportionately affect all racial/ethnic minorities especially in HLA and AANHPI populations. By\nunderstanding the genetic and response differences among HLA, AANHPI compared to NHWs, we could\nenhance the precision of therapeutic treatments, identify resistance-associated biomarkers, and study\nresistance mechanisms to targeted therapies.

Such leukemias are associated with poor\noutcome, and more effective therapies are required. The long-term goal of this Center for Experimental and\nPreclinical Modeling of NUP98 Leukemia is to determine the molecular role, and potential vulnerabilities, of\nNUP98-fusion oncoproteins in leukemia through the development and interrogation of human and mouse model\nsystems, and to develop and test novel therapeutic approaches. The Center has assembled a consortium of\ninvestigators with complementary expertise in genomic characterization, leukemia modeling, chromatin biology,\nstructural biology and preclinical modeling. The Center is led by Dr Charles Mullighan of St Jude Children’s\nResearch Hospital together with Project Co-Leaders Drs Scott Armstrong (Dana Farber Cancer Institute),\nTaosheng Chen (St Jude), Alex Kentsis (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute), Jeffery Klco (St Jude) and\nRichard Kriwacki (St Jude). These investigators will co-Lead four projects performing experimental modeling\n(Project 1), investigating chromatin biology (Project 2), phase separation (Project 3) and drug development\n(Project 4) that will address the following questions and unmet needs: (1) to define how NUP98 fusions drive\nleukemogenesis using complementary, integrative engineered models and proteomic, transcriptomic and\nepigenomic profiles; (2) to develop genetically faithful engineered mouse, human and xenograft models of\nNUP98 leukemia for mechanistic interrogation and preclinical modeling; (3) to define the macromolecular\nchromatin and protein complexes assembled by NUP98 FOs; (4) to define the role of phase separation in NUP98\nFO leukemogenesis; (5) to define the dependencies and vulnerabilities of NUP98-rearranged leukemic cells;\nand (6) to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for NUP98-rearranged leukemia. The Center is\nsupported by an Administrative Core A that with an External Advisory Board will oversee project progress\ninteraction and reporting, a Genome Editing Core B led by Dr David Chen (City of Hope) that provides expertise\nand support for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing scans and screens; and a Chemistry Core C led by Dr Zoran\nRankovic (St Jude) that supports chemical library screen and drug design and development.

The primary tumor is initiated and driven by a single alteration in the DNA: A deletion of ~400kb that results in a fusion gene between the heat shock co-chaperone DNAJB1 and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, PRKACA. If the tumor is limited to the liver, then surgery is the accepted therapy. However, if the tumor has metastasized, there is no accepted therapy. This project will determine how the fusion oncoprotein leads to pathogenesis and will develop therapeutics targeted to the fusion oncoprotein. Pathogenesis is being probed by examining what is different about the fusion oncoprotein that causes changes in the cell.

The primary tumor is initiated and driven by a single alteration in the DNA: A deletion of ~400kb that results in a fusion gene between the heat shock co-chaperone DNAJB1 and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, PRKACA. If the tumor is limited to the liver, then surgery is the accepted therapy. However, if the tumor has metastasized, there is no accepted therapy. This project will determine how the fusion oncoprotein leads to pathogenesis and will develop therapeutics targeted to the fusion oncoprotein. Pathogenesis is being probed by examining what is different about the fusion oncoprotein that causes changes in the cell. Therapeutics will target the fusion oncoprotein through small molecules to block activity, or small molecules to send it to the proteasome, or small molecules for allosteric inhibition.

project	3U54CA244438-01S3	3U54CA244438-01S3	10285941	2021	Engineering synthetic helper cells that autonomously deliver orthogonal IL-2 to selectively promote therapeutic T cell proliferation in tumors	Project Summary/Abstract\nThe goal of this collaboration between the Lim/UCSF and June/UPenn IOTN centers is to develop a novel\napproach to autonomously and selectively drive proliferation of CAR T cells within a solid tumor. Current clinical\ndata indicates that strong proliferation is critical for therapeutic success of adoptively transferred T cells1,2. In\nsolid tumors this is a particularly acute challenge as tumor cells are surrounded by an immunosuppressive\nmicroenvironment that presents multiple barriers to T cell expansion and activity, including suppressive\nregulatory T cells that act as sinks for pro-proliferation cytokines3, as well as other suppressor cells and factors\nthat promote terminal T cell differentiation into an exhausted state4,5. To address these problems, we will combine\nthe expertise of our two groups: the Garcia Lab (June/UPenn center) has expertise in engineering orthogonal\ncytokine/receptor systems, while the Lim Lab (Lim/UCSF center) has expertise in engineering synthetic helper\ncells that can autonomously recognize and remodel the tumor microenvironment in a targeted way using\nsynthetic paracrine cytokine circuits. In this collaboration, we propose to engineer synthetic helper cells that\nautonomously produce orthogonal IL-26 in tumors, thereby selectively driving CAR T cell expansion locally. This\ncollaboration merges approaches from both centers in a synergistic way. If successful, this approach will yield\na way to promote CAR T cell expansion in tumors more effectively, selectively and autonomously than\napproaches within the original individual center aims. Our specific aims are to:\nAim 1. Engineer synthetic helper T cells that deliver ortho-IL2 to the tumor micro-environment\nAim 1.1: Engineer mouse ortho-IL-2 helper/killer cell system; test in vitro and in syngeneic tumor models\nAim 1.2: Engineer human ortho-IL-2 helper/killer cell system; test in vitro and in NSG xenograft tumor models\nAim 2: Modulate orthogonal IL-2 receptor signaling to improve and tune cell responses to ortho-IL2.\nSystematically alter the signaling domains in the ortho-IL-2 receptor intracellular domain to identify and deploy\nvariants that increase T cell proliferation and/or minimize exhaustion.

The purpose of this U54 is to employ immuno-engineering principles to design more\ndurable, accessible, and less toxic immunoprevention and immunotherapy strategies. A national priority\nset by the Cancer Moonshot initiative is to support studies incorporating next-generation genetic\nengineering, engineered biomaterials, nanotechnology, computational and mathematical modelling, or\nsystems biology approaches in the design, implementation and evaluation of next generation\nimmunotherapies focused on overcoming immunosuppressive barriers, targeting tumor cells for killing,\nand generating long-lasting anti-cancer immunological memory. The focus of our U54 entitled\n“Engineering the next generation of T cells” is on developing next-generation gene-editing or\nmodification of immune cells to improve persistence in vivo, control and manipulate the immune system\nto reduce oﬀ-target toxicities and enhance anti-tumor eﬀectiveness of adoptive cell therapy. Our central\nhypothesis is that next generation engineering can improve the safety and efficacy of CAR T cells\nwhile decreasing the cost of goods. There are three scientific projects in our U54 Center. The shared\ngoal of these projects is to enable this powerful therapy to reach a broader spectrum of patients with\nblood cancer and solid cancers. In Project 1, we are using CRISPR/Cas9 to edit the epigenome of T\ncells and to make cells resistant to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), while employing engineering\ntechnologies to automate CAR T cell culture. The goal of Project 2 is to generate universal CAR T cells\n(UCART) using advanced genetic editing technologies and then to compare UCAR to autologous CAR\nT in a unique model of canine cancer. In Project 3 we will use advanced protein engineering, cell\nengineering and oncolytic vectors to test synthetic cytokine and cytokine receptor systems in mouse\nand human T cells, with the long-term goal of eliminating or reducing the need for lymphodepleting\nconditioning chemotherapy prior to adoptive cell transfer. Our approach is multidisciplinary and multi-\ninstitutional. We have brought together a cadre of exceptional investigators from multiple disciplines\nwho have collaborated and published together for many years. State of the art genetic editing with\nCRISPR/Cas9 and cell culture technologies at the University of Pennsylvania are synergistically\ncoupled with world-class protein engineering and structural biology at Stanford University. Each project\nis led by recognized authorities in the field.\nThe Administrative Core for this U54 is designed to manage and coordinate all i3 Center Research\nProject activities and serve as the liaison between the i3 Center and the IOTN Data Management and\nResource-sharing Center (U24) and other Cancer Moonshot consortia, including the Pediatric\nImmunotherapy Discovery and Development Network (PI-DDN). In addition, the Administrative Core\nwill coordinate collaborative research activities between the i3 Center Research Project PD(s)/PI(s) and\nIOTN (or other) investigators. The potential for paradigm-shifting impact this U54 is to transform the\nlessons of first-generation CAR T for leukemia and lymphoma into meaningful efficacy against all\nmalignancies.

project	1U54CA244719-01	1U54CA244719-01	9870537	2019	Nano-Immuno-Oncology Approaches to Overcome Tumor Immune Evasion	Abstract\n While immunotherapies have achieved remarkable success in cancer care in recent years, a large\npercentage of patients remain unresponsive to currently available treatments. Growing evidence\nindicates dysfunctional innate and adaptive immune responses in the tumor microenvironment are\nresponsible for tumor evasion that limits the efficacy of the current immunotherapies. Efficacious cancer\nimmunotherapy requires a holistic, system approach to identify and engage key molecular and cellular\npathways as well as tumor microenvironment signals to benefit a broad spectrum of cancer patients.\nThe overarching goal of this U54 i3 Center application is to harness research synergy in immunobiology,\nprotein engineering and cancer nanotechnology to develop and validate new nano-immuno-oncology\ntherapeutics for cancer therapy. Four investigators, Zhijian `James' Chen, Yang-Xin Fu, Baran Sumer,\nand Jinming Gao, supported by the Administrative Core, will advance the frontier of knowledge of\nmolecular and cellular engineering of the tumor immune milieu for robust antitumor immunity. Each\nproject will bring a unique toolset and therapeutic strategy to tackle the immune refractory challenges in\nsolid tumors. Dr. Chen will lead Project 1 to investigate the role of cGAS-STING pathway in intrinsic\ntumor immunity and evaluate antitumor efficacy of cGAMP nanoparticles in endogenous tumor models.\nDr. Fu will lead Project 2 to engineer tumor-targeted delivery of CD47 and T cell activators (IL-2/IL-15) to\nstimulate innate and adaptive antitumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Dr. Gao and Dr. Sumer\nwill lead Project 3 to establish CD47-encoded ultra-pH sensitive nanoparticles as a broad nanoplatform\nfor tumor-targeted delivery of innate and adaptive immune modulators. If successful, our studies will\ndevelop innovative and synergistic combinations of small molecular agonists, engineered antibodies and\ncytokines, and pH sensitive nanoparticle technology. The U54 i3 Center will create a new paradigm for\ncancer immunotherapy by targeting key molecular, cellular and tumor microenvironment signals to\ngenerate and sustain tumor-specific innate and adaptive immunity. Ultimately, this paradigm could\nsignificantly advance clinical care for patients with intractable cancers.

Defects in T cell number,\ndifferentiation, activation and anti-cancer activity can compromise anti-cancer immunity. We envision\nbiomaterials that act at various stages of T cell differentiation and activation to enhance anti-cancer immunity in\na number of settings. This i3 Center will advance efficacious biomaterial-based immunotherapies through\nmarrying the expertise in bioengineering from accomplished investigators at the Wyss Institute for Biologically\nInspired Engineering with the expertise in cancer immunology, stem cell biology, and clinical oncology from\naccomplished basic and translational scientists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General\nHospital. Our groups have made major contributions to the development of checkpoint blockade therapy,\nneoantigen vaccines, cellular therapies, and therapeutic biomaterials in the past, and here will take a material-\nbased approach to address a number of related, fundamental questions in immunoengineering. The Specific\nAims of the i3 Center are: (1) To develop artificial antigen presenting cells that closely mimic normal T cell\nactivation to selectively expand large numbers of highly functional polyclonal antigen-specific CD8 T cells, and\nexplore if adoptive transfer of polyclonal T cells will provide tumor control. (2) Determine if co-delivery of\nneoantigens and adjuvants with precise nanoscale distribution and stoichiometric loading, using DNA origami,\ncan provide a powerful platform to boost the development of cytotoxic T lymphocyte anti-cancer responses, and\n(3) Create biomaterials which recreate key features of the normal hematopoietic stem cell niche, and utilize to\nenable rapid reconstitution of T cells in settings where there are deficiencies in T cell number and repertoire, in\norder to enhance generation of T cell-mediated anti-cancer immunity. The leadership and organizational\nstructure of the i3 Center, which includes a Biostatistics Core, reflect the close collaboration among the\nparticipating disciplines and institutions, and will promote the effective execution of the proposed work and its\nfuture translation to clinical testing. The synergistic set of activities in the i3 not only address specific stages\nwhere immune control can fail, but the lessons learned and technologies developed in each project strongly\nimpact the others. The Center is expected to yield major scientific and translational advances in cancer\nimmunotherapy.

The overall goal of our project, Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening\nand Follow-up through Implementation Science in Chicago (ACCSIS-Chicago), is to test a multilevel,\nmulticomponent intervention to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among\nracial/ethnic minority and low income populations in Chicago, Illinois. In this project, we will include two\ndifferent types of implementation strategies: 1) evidence-based multilevel, multicomponent intervention to\nincrease rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care; and 2) implementation support strategies to\nsupport the implementation process that contribute to the adoption, implementation and sustainment of our\nproposed multilevel, multicomponent intervention. We will partner with 4 federally qualified health centers\n(FQHCs), which have 35 clinics in the Chicago area and provided primary care service to nearly 188,000\nracial/ethnic minority and low income populations in 2016. During the UG3 Planning-Exploratory Phase, we will\nwork with one of the 4 FQHC partners to pilot test, measure, and refine our proposed multilevel,\nmulticomponent intervention in preparation for the experimental trial in the UH3 Implementation Phase, as well\nas assess the effectiveness of our implementation support strategies. In the UH3 Implementation Phase, we\nwill use a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to examine the effectiveness and impact of our\nmultilevel, multicomponent intervention on increasing rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care\nacross our 4 partner FQHCs. The selection of our intervention components will be based on intensive literature\nreview, and findings and lessons learned from our previous studies and projects. Our multilevel intervention\ncomponents will include EMR provider reminders, provider assessment and feedback, patient navigation,\nprovider education and community outreach. We will also test one local innovation, IL ColonCARES, during the\nUGH Phase to increase the rate of follow-up after a positive stool test among uninsured patients by linking\nuninsured patients with specialty services. We expect the finding from this study to have broad impact on\nunderstanding the implementation process to increase colorectal cancer screening, follow up, and referral to\ncare across diverse health systems.

In North\nCarolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions.\nCommunity health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable\npopulations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%.\nSubstantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and\nsystem-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening\ntargets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based\nscreening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase\nscreening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to\nsystematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for\nuninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from\nstakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We\nhypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective\napproaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through\nimproved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research,\nimplementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central\nhypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based\ninterventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable.\nThe specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention\nto increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot\nstudies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a\nprocess for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2\n(Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening\napproaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess\nimplementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the\nmultilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening. This\nproject is innovative in combining outreach and in-reach EBIs and in its use of stakeholder-engaged simulation\nmodeling to inform sustainability. The proposed research is significant because it will have a substantial impact\non CRC morbidity, mortality, and disparities in vulnerable communities.

Specifically, the\nAppalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern\nKentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the\narea are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents\nscreened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence\non CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of\nKentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with\nAppalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention\nand control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted\nfrom evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the\ncommunity (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in\n12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base\nfor a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically\nunderserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden\nof CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test,\nmeasure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH\nand Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI\napproval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI\nin a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC\nscreening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2)\nAssess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with\ncommunity and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to\nearly or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined\nby US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county-\nlevel behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk\nFactor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating\nCenter, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community\npartners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia.

ABSTRACT\nColorectal cancer (CRC) screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality. The US\nPreventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends CRC screening through a variety of invasive and non-\ninvasive tests for individuals aged 50 to 75 years. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and other strategies\nexist to promote CRC screening, but adoption and implementation of these are limited, especially in CHCs.\nOur hypothesis is that a Hub and Spoke multilevel intervention will be superior to usual care. The hub will be\nHealth Quality Partners of Southern California (HQP), a non-profit organization comprised of 16 CHC systems\n(spokes), serving 135 rural and urban clinic sites. We propose a 2-phase study to pilot and optimize (Phase I)\nand rigorously test (Phase II) the Hub and Spoke approach and its impact on CRC screening, follow-up, and\nusual care. UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary\noutcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed\nmethods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients\nserved by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and\ncoordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3\nImplementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a\nregionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care\namong CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability\nModel (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,\nMaintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness\nof the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post\nimplementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3)\nproportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and\nsustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods\napproach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM\nconstructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e.\npatients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and\nSustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of\nImplementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate\nprogress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are\nscalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.

Specifically, we aim to improve CRC screening rates, follow-up\ncolonoscopy, and referral to care in rural Medicaid patients by implementing a direct mail fecal testing\nprogram with targeted outreach and patient navigation for follow-up colonoscopy. We leverage\npartnerships with the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN), Kaiser Northwest\nCenter for Health Research, and Medicaid Health Plans and deliver training and implementation\nsupport to participating rural primary care clinics using practice facilitation. In total, we anticipate\nworking with 30 organizations to facilitate implementation with 130 primary care clinics\n(reaching 17,000+ rural Medicaid patients).\nIn Phase I (Year 01), we will conduct a milestone driven pilot to build the necessary infrastructure for a\nlarge-scale implementation-effectiveness trial, including adapting the clinic-health plan-vendor\nsupported direct mail program for rural Medicaid patients that have not established care and/or never\nbeen screened; conducting a pilot study testing the feasibility and acceptability of patient navigation to\nsupport follow-up colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal test; engaging Medicaid Health Plans and\nrecruiting 30 primary care clinics located in rural and frontier counties in Oregon; and developing the\ntraining and support materials needed to implement a large-scale trial in these settings.\nIn Phase II (Years 02-05), we will conduct an implementation-effectiveness study using a quasi-\nexperimental stepped wedge design in 30 rural primary care clinics using program training and practice\nfacilitation to support implementation. As in the pilot, the intervention combines: (1) a clinic-health plan-\nvendor supported direct-mail fecal testing program with targeted outreach for patients who have never\nbeen screened or who have yet to establish care and (2) patient navigation for those who are referred\nfor colonoscopy as either the primary screening or for follow-up from an abnormal fecal test. We will\nevaluate effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention through quantitative and\nqualitative measures. Results from the implementation study will inform scale-up of the program\nthrough partnerships with 20 regional and national organizations that serve rural/frontier primary care\nclinics using webinars, train-the-trainer workshops and collaborative learning activities using the ECHO\n(Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) model.

Among patients with NF1, loss of\nthe non-mutant allele of NF1 in a rare Schwann cell or precursor, along with other ill-defined factors, leads to\nbenign dermal or plexiform neurofibromas. The main cause of death among NF1 patients is the malignant\nperipheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), a highly aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most likely develops\nfrom plexiform neurofibroma, in particular the so-called “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma. Approximately half of\nMPNSTs are NF1-associated, and NF1 patients have 10-15% lifetime risk of developing this terrible cancer.\nMPNSTs metastasize early and are often resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main treatment for\nMPNSTs is surgical resection but, despite radical excision with wide surgical margins, followed by\nchemoradiation, 5-year survival rates are poor due to metastases as well as local recurrence. NF1 patients\ncould greatly benefit from prophylactic vaccination that would prevent the malignant transformation of benign\nplexiform neurofibromas into “atypical” plexiform neurofibromas and to MPNSTs. We aim to determine if the\nmutations that govern the development of “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma (NF1 loss followed by CDKN2A\nloss) and MPSNT (NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12 loss) lead to the expression of recurrent alternately processed\ntranscripts, such as transcriptionally-induced chimeras, that could express neoantigens and be used as targets\nfor prophylactic vaccines. Such transcripts can be translated to produce novel peptides downstream of\nframeshift mutations caused by coding exon read-through into introns, mis-splicing from a coding exon to a\nnon-canonical splice acceptors or splice acceptors in other genes. In most cases, a premature termination\ncodon (PTC) will be rapidly encountered by the ribosome translating such transcripts. Therefore, we\nfurthermore hypothesize that these alternately processed transcripts can express what we call “cryptic”\nneoantigens when treated with drugs that suppress utilization of premature codons such as Ataluren or\ngentamycin. In such a way, we could administer a prophylactic vaccine and induce conditionally active immune\nresponse that would eliminate nascent tumors only when drug treatment is used.

Approximately half of\nMPNSTs are NF1-associated, and NF1 patients have 10-15% lifetime risk of developing this terrible cancer.\nMPNSTs metastasize early and are often resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main treatment for\nMPNSTs is surgical resection but, despite radical excision with wide surgical margins, followed by\nchemoradiation, 5-year survival rates are poor due to metastases as well as local recurrence. NF1 patients\ncould greatly benefit from prophylactic vaccination that would prevent the malignant transformation of benign\nplexiform neurofibromas into “atypical” plexiform neurofibromas and to MPNSTs. We aim to determine if the\nmutations that govern the development of “atypical” plexiform neurofibroma (NF1 loss followed by CDKN2A\nloss) and MPSNT (NF1, CDKN2A, and SUZ12 loss) lead to the expression of recurrent alternately processed\ntranscripts, such as transcriptionally-induced chimeras, that could express neoantigens and be used as targets\nfor prophylactic vaccines. Such transcripts can be translated to produce novel peptides downstream of\nframeshift mutations caused by coding exon read-through into introns, mis-splicing from a coding exon to a\nnon-canonical splice acceptors or splice acceptors in other genes. In most cases, a premature termination\ncodon (PTC) will be rapidly encountered by the ribosome translating such transcripts. Therefore, we\nfurthermore hypothesize that these alternately processed transcripts can express what we call “cryptic”\nneoantigens when treated with drugs that suppress utilization of premature codons such as Ataluren or\ngentamycin. In such a way, we could administer a prophylactic vaccine and induce conditionally active immune\nresponse that would eliminate nascent tumors only when drug treatment is used.

An\nimproved understanding of the biology of lung cancer is needed to intercept the disease at an early point in\nits progression. Our project, which is inspired by that challenge, focuses on events transpiring in the earliest\nradiographically-detected manifestation of lung cancer: the computerized tomography (CT)-detected non-\nsolid nodule, of which as many as 40% harbor frankly invasive adenocarcinoma. Thus, despite conventional\nwisdom that CT-detected non-solid nodules represent pre or minimally invasive malignancy, clearly transition\nto more invasive histologies occurs in a significant proportion of these nodules.\nUnderstanding the cellular and molecular changes within non-solid nodules that drive progression will provide\nunique and novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that\nalterations in cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) have a role in initiating and supporting this\nprogression. In agreement with that proposal, our preliminary multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) studies\nsuggest that progression to a more invasive phenotype is associated with the development of a strong\nimmunosuppressive TME. In this project we test our hypothesis using multidimensional methods to profile the\nTME and to determine the crosstalk between cancer cells and the TME in pre-invasive to invasive human\nlung non-solid adenocarcinomas. Comparative analysis of the cellular and molecular events associated with\nthe distinct histological stages will lead to identification of the critical events triggering progression and\nthereby identify targets to intercept disease progression. We will use appropriate mouse models in pre-clinical\nstudies to develop these targets as strategies to intercept progression of pre-invasive to invasive cancer.\nIn the first phase of these studies (UG3 phase), we will define TME alterations associated with progression of\nlung nodules using RNAseq profiling and image-based methods (multiplex IF and imaging CyTOF) in studies\nof our archival tumor samples. These studies will generate a comprehensive catalogue of the cellular and\nmolecular events that trigger progression of indolent lesions to frankly invasive cancers, with a strong focus\non immune mechanisms. These analyses will provide novel and detailed insights into how the composition\nand activity of the TME changes with progression. In the second phase (UH3 phase), we will leverage mouse\nmodels to explore interception strategies to target immune mechanisms and prevent progression.\nThe proposed cohort satisfies the RFA’s focus on High-Risk Cohorts for Cancer-Immunoprevention Studies,\nsince lung nodules are premalignancies highly prevalent in smokers.

In North\nCarolina (NC), underuse of screening contributes to particularly high CRC burden in certain regions.\nCommunity health centers (CHCs) play a critical role in providing CRC screening for these vulnerable\npopulations. Yet, CRC screening rates in NC CHCs are well below the estimated national rate of 62%.\nSubstantial efforts are needed to reach the national target of 80%. Because multiple patient-, provider-, and\nsystem-level factors contribute to low screening rates, multilevel interventions are needed to achieve screening\ntargets. Accumulating evidence shows that interventions involving mailed screening outreach, practice-based\nscreening in-reach (using patient navigators), and systematically improving colonoscopy access, all increase\nscreening. However, in practice, CHCs face substantial resource limitations and lack the means to\nsystematically implement a multi-level intervention of outreach, in-reach, and improved colonoscopy access for\nuninsured patients. Until a multi-level intervention is shown to be both effective and cost-effective from\nstakeholder perspectives, screening rates will remain low, leaving thousands of vulnerable patients at risk. We\nhypothesize that standardizing these interventions for CHCs at the state-level will yield cost-effective\napproaches to increasing screening. Our long-term goal is to reduce CRC burden and disparities through\nimproved screening. Our objective here is to leverage our expertise in CRC screening intervention research,\nimplementation science, stakeholder engagement, and modeling to achieve this goal for our state. Our central\nhypothesis is that a pragmatic trial assessing impacts and costs for combinations of these evidence-based\ninterventions (EBIs) will yield one or more strategies that stakeholders find to be cost-effective and sustainable.\nThe specific aims for our study are: Aim 1 (Planning and Exploratory Phase): Pilot test a multilevel intervention\nto increase CRC screening in vulnerable populations in three NC regions. In this phase, we will complete pilot\nstudies needed for our signature trial, plan for implementation evaluation and sustainability, and develop a\nprocess for evaluating locally-developed innovative approaches for improving screening. Aim 2\n(Implementation Phase): Building on Aim 1 findings, implement and evaluate multilevel CRC screening\napproaches in vulnerable populations in NC. In this phase, we will conduct our signature trial, assess\nimplementation outcomes, evaluate the use of stakeholder-engaged modeling for sustaining and scaling the\nmultilevel intervention, and select and evaluate locally-developed innovations for improving screening.

Specifically, the\nAppalachian Regional Commission classifies 32 eastern Ohio (OH) counties and the 54 counties in eastern\nKentucky (KY) as north central and central Appalachia, respectively. CRC incidence and mortality rates in the\narea are among the highest in the nation, and neither state meets the national target of 80% of eligible residents\nscreened for CRC. There have been few randomized intervention trials addressing multiple levels of influence\non CRC screening behaviors and outcomes in this region. To address this gap, investigators at the University of\nKentucky and The Ohio State University will build on a 12-year collaborative history, strong relationships with\nAppalachian communities and health clinics, and extensive experience with community-based cancer prevention\nand control intervention research to develop, implement, and evaluate a multilevel intervention (MLI) – adapted\nfrom evidence-based interventions that include components targeting clinics and providers (in-reach) and the\ncommunity (outreach) – to increase CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care among patients age 50-74 in\n12 counties in Appalachian KY and OH. The overall goals of this project are to contribute to the evidence-base\nfor a MLI that increases rates of CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care, particularly in rural, medically\nunderserved populations, and help showcase best practices for how MLIs can be scaled-up to reduce the burden\nof CRC in the U.S. For the Planning-Exploratory Phase (UG3) in Year 1, our specific aims are to: 1) Pilot test,\nmeasure, and refine a MLI to increase rates of CRC screening, follow-up and referral-to-care in Appalachian OH\nand Appalachian KY; and 2) Provide evidence supporting transition to the Implementation Phase (UH3) [per NCI\napproval]. For the Implementation Phase (UH4) in Years 2-5, our specific aims are to: 1) Test the revised MLI\nin a group randomized trial, delayed intervention to assess the impact of the MLI on increasing rates of CRC\nscreening, follow-up, and referral-to-care among Appalachian KY and Appalachian OH populations; and 2)\nAssess dissemination and sustainability of the intervention. The project will be implemented in collaboration with\ncommunity and clinical partners in 12 counties, 6 in Ohio and 6 in Kentucky. Counties will be randomized to\nearly or delayed intervention after baseline data collection. The main outcome will be CRC screening as defined\nby US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and measured by clinic electronic health records and county-\nlevel behavioral assessments using random digit dialed telephone surveys similar to CDC’s Behavioral Risk\nFactor Surveillance System. Our work will be accomplished through collaboration with the ACCSIS Coordinating\nCenter, other ACCSIS Research Projects, ACCSIS Steering Committee and Workgroups, NCI, and community\npartners. If effective, this MLI will be disseminated to our clinical and community partners throughout Appalachia.

ABSTRACT\nColorectal cancer (CRC) screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality. The US\nPreventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends CRC screening through a variety of invasive and non-\ninvasive tests for individuals aged 50 to 75 years. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and other strategies\nexist to promote CRC screening, but adoption and implementation of these are limited, especially in CHCs.\nOur hypothesis is that a Hub and Spoke multilevel intervention will be superior to usual care. The hub will be\nHealth Quality Partners of Southern California (HQP), a non-profit organization comprised of 16 CHC systems\n(spokes), serving 135 rural and urban clinic sites. We propose a 2-phase study to pilot and optimize (Phase I)\nand rigorously test (Phase II) the Hub and Spoke approach and its impact on CRC screening, follow-up, and\nusual care. UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary\noutcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed\nmethods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients\nserved by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and\ncoordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3\nImplementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a\nregionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care\namong CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability\nModel (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,\nMaintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness\nof the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post\nimplementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3)\nproportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and\nsustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods\napproach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM\nconstructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e.\npatients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and\nSustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of\nImplementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate\nprogress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are\nscalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.

UG3 Planning/Exploratory Phase AIM: Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary \noutcomes of a multilevel intervention for CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care using a mixed \nmethods approach. The intervention includes HQP hub-based delivery of centralized mailed FIT to patients \nserved by individual CHCs-spokes plus complimentary provider and clinic-level interventions at CHCs, and \ncoordination of a standardized navigation strategy delivered by CHCs for abnormal FIT follow-up. UH3 \nImplementation Phase. We will conduct a 2-arm pragmatic randomized trial to assess impact of a \nregionally-developed multilevel intervention to increase CRC screening, follow-up, and referral-to-care \namong CHC patients. The trial will be guided by the Pragmatic, Robust Implementation and Sustainability \nModel (PRISM), which includes outcomes from the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, \nMaintenance (RE-AIM) framework and expands them with contextual constructs. Aim 1. Assess effectiveness\nof the multilevel intervention based on: 1) improvement in proportion up-to-date with screening 3 years post \nimplementation; 2) proportion with abnormal FIT who complete diagnostic colonoscopy within 6 months; and 3) \nproportion with CRC completing first treatment evaluation. Aim 2. Evaluate the implementation, scalability, and \nsustainability of a multilevel implementation strategy. Implementation will be evaluated with a mixed methods \napproach using the RE-AIM outcomes of Reach, Adoption, and Implementation as well as the PRISM \nconstructs of Intervention Characteristics and Recipients from perspective of multiple stakeholders (i.e. \npatients, front-line staff, and operational leaders). We will also calculate replication costs. Scalability and \nSustainability will be evaluated using the RE-AIM outcome of Maintenance and the PRISM constructs of \nImplementation & Sustainability Infrastructure and External Environment. Our study will help accelerate \nprogress in CRC prevention in underserved populations by identifying multilevel intervention strategies that are \nscalable to additional CHCs in the region, with potential for larger scale implementation.

project	1UM1CA233033-01	1UM1CA233033-01	9625964	2018	Enhanced, EHR-facilitated Cancer Symptom Control (E2C2) Pragmatic Clinical Trial	Cancer and its treatment engender disabling symptoms that are frequently undertreated, and associated with\nneedlessly increased healthcare utilization, non-adherence to oncologic treatments, and reduced survival. The\nkey to addressing this damaging situation lies in reliably detecting symptoms and providing evidence-based\ncare. Of note, the National Academy of Medicine has identified systematic screening with patient reported\noutcomes (PROs) as critical, not only to symptom control, but also to enhancing the patient centricity and\neffectiveness of cancer care in general. Unfortunately, experience has shown that simply presenting PRO data\nto over-loaded, treatment-focused clinicians has minimal or no impact on the outcomes of patients with many\ndiseases, including cancer. On the other hand, providing these data to mid-level providers and entrusting them\nto initiate, monitor and adapt individually tailored symptom management plans has proven robustly effective in\nthe control of cancer-related and other symptoms. However, the high resource requirements of this approach\nhave heretofore limited its dissemination and scalability. Encouragingly, such resource intense care is not\nalways required for meaningfully benefit, as attested by the effectiveness of interventions that provide patients\nexperiencing mild or moderate with self-management education. This application recognizes the need for both\nlow- and high-touch approaches to cancer symptom control and proposes the Enhanced, EHR-facilitated\nCancer Symptom Control (E2C2) pragmatic clinical trial to test a bundled intervention that leverages EHR\ninterface and clinical decision support functionalities to operationalize the population-level implementation of an\napproach that automatically triages symptomatic patients to low-touch automated self-management (Level 1),\nor high-touch nurse care management (Level 2), both validated, depending on PRO scores, as well as patient\nand clinical factors. The E2C2 intervention will target Sleep disturbance, Pain, Anxiety, Depression, and\nEnergy deficit/fatigue, the SPADE pentad which represents the most prevalent and potentially treatable group\nof overlapping cancer symptoms. To rigorously assess the effectiveness of discrete E2C2 intervention\ncomponents, we will initially test a Stage 1 Symptom Control Bundle for 12 months, after which we will add\na Stage 2 Implementation Bundle. The trial's stepped wedge design will randomize the order of E2C2\nimplementation among 21 clusters. Clusters will be defined at the level of the cancer care team, and will be\nrandomized to one of five different tranches to receive the intervention at staggered 6 month intervals.\nOutcomes will include SPADE symptom scores (primary), physical function, social participation, quality of life,\ndistress, healthcare utilization, adherence to cancer treatment, and vital status which will be collected for 9-12\nmonths during each trial phase; pre-E2C2, Stage 1 and Stage 2. A multi-stakeholder, mixed methods\napproach will be used to comprehensively assess the impact of the Stage 2 Implementation Bundle, as well as\nboth Stages' impact on rurally-based and elderly patients, groups prone to disparities in symptom control.

Despite the\ndevelopment of improved symptom management interventions, and several evidence- and consensus-based\nguidelines, their timely delivery remains uneven in the health care system. Our research center, Northwestern\nUniversity IMPACT (NU IMPACT), builds upon an integrated cancer symptom monitoring and management\nsystem (NMPRO), currently deployed by our health care delivery system. We will test the effectiveness of a\nsystem-wide symptom management intervention when implemented across the Northwestern Memorial\nHealthCare Corporation (NMHC) outpatient oncology clinics. Using a clinic-level randomized roll-out\nimplementation trial design, we will further test, using an embedded patient-level randomized controlled clinical\ntrial, the effectiveness of an enhanced care (EC) approach aimed to engage participants actively, and to\nincrease self-efficacy, in the monitoring and managing of their symptoms. The existing NMPRO will constitute\nusual care (UC), and added patient engagement and activation features will comprise the EC condition. This\ninnovative hybrid trial design allows for a within- and between-site evaluation of implementation along with a\nsufficiently powered group-based comparison to demonstrate effectiveness on individual patient outcomes.\n We propose three specific aims that target both patient- and system-level outcomes. Aim 1: Implement a\nfully-integrated oncology symptom assessment and management program across six clinical units that are part\nof the NMHC healthcare delivery system; Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the program by conducting a hybrid\nType I effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the enhanced care program (EC: symptom monitoring &\nself-management intervention), relative to usual care (UC) on patient- and system-level outcomes; Aim 3:\nIdentify facilitators and barriers to implementation and disseminate to other health systems. We will enroll an\nestimated 12,671 participants. To address possible contamination effects within each clinical unit, and allow for\nunit-level data collection for pre- and post-implementation comparison within and across clinical units, 50% will\nbe enrolled and followed prior to program implementation. The other half will be enrolled post-implementation\nand will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (stratified by sex and cancer phase; curative intent, non-curative\nintent & survivorship) to UC versus EC. Fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression will be assessed using\nPROMIS® computerized adaptive tests (CATs). In addition, we will assess patient clinical outcomes, including\nhealthcare utilization, and cancer treatment delivery outcomes. The NU IMPACT study design allows joint\nevaluation of system-level implementation and patient-level effectiveness metrics. An extensive array of\nlongitudinal EHR data will be integrated using custom informatics tools and deployed for statistical analysis\nusing plans that blend psychometric and biostatistical outcome evaluation models. Successful elements of this\nintervention approach will then be extended to widespread adoption.

project	3UM1CA233035-01S1	3UM1CA233035-01S1	10378999	2021	Implementation and Evaluation of an Expanded Bilingual Electronic Symptom Management Program across a Multi-site, Fully-integrated Comprehensive Cancer Center	Project Summary\nPhysical and functional symptom burden is high among cancer survivors and is an ideal target for chronic care\nmanagement. Cancer-related physical and functional side effects (PFs) include joint pain, fatigue, muscle\nweakness, loss of range of motion, altered skin sensation and integrity, postural abnormality, and lymphedema.\nCancer survivors lack the knowledge and skills to prevent, detect, and manage PF side effects. Our research\nshows that a majority of cancer survivors report 3 or more long-lasting PFs and that rehabilitation services are\nunder-utilized to treat them. Cancer rehabilitation interventions can reduce PFs and support functional ability.\nHowever, our work shows that cancer survivors lack receptivity to and misunderstand the benefits of cancer\nrehabilitation – even among those with cancer-related disability. Oncology providers also lack system support\nfor timely identification of PFs and referral to rehabilitation. Usual cancer care lacks ownership for effective\nsurveillance and management of PFs that can be done without interrupting clinical flow and overburdening\nproviders and patients. Early rehabilitation (pre-hab) could facilitate ownership of PFs by educating patients on\nearly detection and self-management of PFs, but this approach is completely absent from usual cancer care.\nThe parent grant has developed the Northwestern Medicine Patient Reported Outcome (NMPRO) symptom\nmonitoring system that prospectively monitors PFs severity with the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement\nInformation System - Physical Function (PROMIS-PF) survey. With this Diversity Supplement, we will be able\nto: 1) leverage the parent grant to map the development of PFs across different cancer patient populations; 2)\ndevelop a learning health systems mechanism to support oncology providers to match the right patient, at the\nright time, with the right rehabilitation service, in the right location (4Rs Referral System); and 3) obtain\nstakeholder feedback about implementation and dissemination strategies for multi-level (patient, provider,\ncommunity, system) prevention, detection, and management of cancer-related PFs and the development of risk\nstratification models for rehabilitation referral. The results from this supplement will inform the planned R01\nresubmission to the NCI to test the combination of NMPRO + 4Rs + pre-hab in a large-scale randomized\ncontrolled trial. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Map the trajectory and identify risk factors for development of\nphysical and functional impairment and for cancer rehabilitation services utilization from the point of cancer\ndiagnosis through at least the first year after diagnosis; Aim 2: Modify NMPRO to provide a decisional support\nmechanism for early and timely cancer rehabilitation referral in response to electronic health record alerts\ngenerated in the parent study; Aim 3: Identify realistic implementation, dissemination, and adaptation strategies\nfor future hybrid effectiveness trials of pre-habilitation interventions for different cancer patient populations.

project	1UM1CA233080-01	1UM1CA233080-01	9626037	2018	SIMPRO Research Center: Integration and Implementation of PROs for Symptom Management in Oncology Practice	Project Summary\nIn 2018, more than 1.7 million Americans will receive a new cancer diagnosis and nearly 600,000 will die from\ntheir disease. Cancer treatments, including major surgical resection and palliative chemotherapy, are\nassociated with frequent adverse symptoms. The primary burden for managing symptoms falls on patients and\ntheir caregivers, and there is ample evidence that untreated symptoms impair quality of life, lead to inefficient\nuse of emergency care, avoidable hospitalizations, and even shorten survival. Electronic tracking of patient-\nreported outcomes (ePROs) between face-to-face clinic visits has been shown to both reduce symptom burden\nand decrease the need for acute care. Although there is abundant evidence that symptom monitoring can\nimprove cancer care, current experience has been largely limited to single centers or as part of clinical trials.\nUsing ePROs to facilitate symptom control is an attractive strategy but, evidence for effectiveness in different\ntreatment contexts and across varied populations is needed. Further, ePRO tracking systems have not been\nfully integrated into health systems' electronic health records (EHR) and this deficit prevents them from\ndelivering the maximal benefits of proactive symptom management.\nTo fill gaps in the evidence base about the optimal strategy for deploying ePROs, a multidisciplinary team from\n6 health systems have formed the Symptom Management IMplementation of Patient Reported Outcomes in\nOncology (SIMPRO) Research Center. SIMPRO's overarching goal is to develop, implement, and evaluate a\nmulti-component ePRO reporting and management system to improve symptom control for patients recovering\nfrom cancer surgery or patients receiving palliative chemotherapy in small, rural, and community cancer\ncenters. The Specific Aims of the project are to: (1) Adapt existing ePRO symptom management systems and\nintegrate them into the EHR and routine clinical workflow at six health systems; (2) Determine the effectiveness\nof an EHR-integrated ePRO symptom management system on health outcomes; and (3) Evaluate the\nfacilitators and barriers to implementation of an EHR-integrated ePRO symptom management system from the\npatient, clinical and organizational perspectives. Following the adaptation of operational ePRO prototypes and\nfull integration into an EHR, the SIMPRO investigators will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial with\nstepped wedge rollout to investigate the effectiveness of a symptom monitoring system from a patient, clinician\nand health system perspective. Across all study phases, the implementation process itself, including ePRO\nadoption, appropriateness, acceptability, penetration/scalability, and adaptation, will be critically evaluated.\nThis approach will create knowledge that can be used to guide dissemination of ePROs and other interventions\nto improve cancer care delivery.
