The goal of the Knight is to perform cancer-focused research and to convert these\nfindings into treatments and prevention strategies to improve outcomes for cancer patients. The OHSU Knight\nCancer Institute has 139 members who belong to four scientific programs - Cancer Biology, Translational\nOncology, Quantitative Oncology, and Cancer Prevention and Control and utilize six well-established shared\nresources - Flow Cytometry, Proteomics, Advanced Multiscale Microscopy, Integrated Genomics, BioLibrary &\nPathology, and Biostatistics.\nThe 139 Knight members are supported by $87.6 million in total extramural funding, $42.9 million of which is\nfrom the NCI. In the current funding period, members have published 1,139 cancer focused, peer-reviewed\npublications, of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 15% inter-programmatic, and 62% externally collaborative.\nIn 2015 a total of 481 patients were enrolled on therapeutic treatment trials, representing over 10% of our new\npatient population.\nOHSU is the only academic medical center in Oregon and the Knight Cancer Institute is the only NCI-designated\ncancer center in the state. The Knight's catchment area is defined as the entire state of Oregon. Our research\nefforts are targeted to populations and cancers that are unique to our catchment area and includes evaluating\npopulations in our catchment area that are more likely to diagnosed with late-stage cancers. Serving as the\nadvanced oncology care facility for the state, the Knight brings depth and breadth to basic laboratory research;\nclinical research, including early phase clinical trials; and prevention, control, and population-based research\nwith training programs for cancer researchers and health care professionals.\nIn the current funding period we have recruited 32 new investigators, including four Associate Directors,\ncompletely restructured the leadership committees and the programmatic structure of the Knight to facilitate\nintra- and inter-programmatic interactions and to accelerate progress in achieving our goals. This has led to a\nsignificant increase in cancer focus, an increase in NCI funding, and enhanced collaborations as demonstrated\nby publications and collaborative grants. Given our growth and accomplishments in the current funding period,\nwe request consideration for continued funding and feel we are well positioned for consideration of\ncomprehensive status."

Houston is the 4th largest city in the\nUnited States with a very diverse population and Harris County is one of the most rapidly growing in the\ncountry. The DLDCCC Catchment Area has expanded from the core of Harris county to include the 8\nsurrounding counties which comprise the Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), representing a\ndiverse population of more than 7 million individuals (this population is greater than 35 states). The\nDLDCCC is a matrix center with BCM as the lead partner with 4 hospital affiliates, Texas Childrenï¿½s, the\nDeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Ben Taub Hospital, and the new Baylor St. Lukeï¿½s Medical Center\nas formal affiliates. The DLDCCC received NCI designation in 2007 and comprehensive designation in 2014\nand through our evaluation and planning process and recommendations from our EAC and internal\ncommittees, we have since made significant progress strengthening our scientific programs. 53 new cancer\nfaculty have been recruited to the DLDCCC which now has 192 Research members, 78 Clinical members and\n18 Adjunct members. Our cancer-relevant peer reviewed research funding now exceeds $169 million, with\nmore than $49 million ($34M direct) coming from the NCI. Several important scientific accomplishments have\nbeen made that have an impact in our Catchment Area and globally. The DLDCCC comprises 7 research\nprograms: Cell Signaling and Metabolism, Mechanism of Cancer Evolution, Nuclear Receptor, Transcription\nand Chromatin Biology, Breast Cancer, Cancer Cell and Gene Therapy, Cancer Prevention and Population\nScience, and Pediatric Cancer. Significant investments have strengthened the 10 Shared Resources, which\noffer leading technologies. A new shared resource in Advanced In Vivo Cancer Models further enhances our\ncapabilities. The Clinical Protocol and Data Management Core has been significantly enhanced and accruals\nto clinical trials have increased. Accrual of racial and ethnic minorities is outstanding. The Office of Outreach\nand Health Disparities which drives COE disseminates new information and services to the community,\nespecially the underserved. Training and education have been integrated into our Programs through the CRCE\ncore. In this renewal, we ask for increased funding for our 10 Shared Resources and other expanded activities\nimportant to our mission and goals."	cancer prevention;Community Outreach;cell mediated therapies;cell-based therapy;cellular therapy;Cell Therapy;Malignant Cell;cancer cell;programs;Scientist;Clinic;Source;Country;collegiate;college;Medical center;Education and Training;Training and Education;Clinics or Hospitals;Clinics and Hospitals;data management;early detection;Early Diagnosis;metropolitan;member;Basic Research;Basic Science;outreach;outreach program;cancer education;Cancer Treatment;Malignant Neoplasm Therapy;Malignant Neoplasm Treatment;anti-cancer therapy;anticancer therapy;cancer therapy;disparity in health;health disparity;Institution;preventing;prevent;Instruction and Outreach;Training and Outreach;Tutoring and Outreach;Education and Outreach;NCI-Designated Cancer Center;Population Sciences;Resource Sharing;in vivo;National Cancer Burden;Cancer Burden;Cancer Center;CCSG;Cancer Center Support Grant;CancerModel;Cancer Model;Catchment Area;Clinical Data;Clinical Sciences;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Patient outcome;Patient-Centered Outcomes;Patient-Focused Outcomes;scientific accomplishments;scientific advances;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Translational Science;translation research;Translational Research;Process;cell metabolism;cellular metabaolism;Cellular Metabolic Process;under served population;underserved people;Underserved Population;next generation;new approaches;novel approaches;novel strategy;novel strategies;Population;ethnic minority;ethnic minority population;multidisciplinary;racial and ethnic;implementation science;clinical care;Breast Cancer therapy;racial minority;cancer survival;recruit;Infrastructure;Biology;Malignant Neoplasms;Cancers;Malignant Tumor;malignancy;neoplasm/cancer;Child;0-11 years old;Child Youth;Children (0-21);children;childrens';youngster;Chromatin;Cities;Clinical Protocols;Clinical Trials;Communities;Diagnosis;Disease;Disorder;Ethnic group;ethnicity group;Evolution;Faculty;Future;gene therapy;DNA Therapy;Gene Transfer Clinical;Genetic Intervention;gene-based therapy;genetic therapy;genomic therapy;Patient Care;Patient Care Delivery;Geographic Locations;Geographic Area;Geographic Region;Geographical Location;geographic site;Goals;Health;Hospitals;Industry;Information Services;Institutes;Investments;Laboratories;Lead;Pb element;heavy metal Pb;heavy metal lead;Medicine;Mission;Morbidity - disease rate;Morbidity;mortality;United States National Institutes of Health;NIH;National Institutes of Health;Peer Review;Physicians;Play;Population Growth;Recommendation;Research;Role;social role;Signal Transduction;Cell Communication and Signaling;Cell Signaling;Intracellular Communication and Signaling;Signal Transduction Systems;Signaling;biological signal transduction;Technology;Texas;Genetic Transcription;Gene Transcription;RNA Expression;Transcription;Translating;United States;Veterans;Vision;Sight;visual function;Asians;oriental;County;Hispanic Populations;Latino Population;Spanish Origin;hispanic community;Hispanics;diverse populations;heterogeneous population;population diversity;Population Heterogeneity;Uninsured;improved;Area;Clinical;Research Peer Review;Nuclear Receptors;Evaluation;Individual;Interdisciplinary Research;Multidisciplinary Collaboration;Multidisciplinary Research;Interdisciplinary Study;Funding;Childhood Cancers;Malignant Childhood Tumor;Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm;Malignant Pediatric Tumor;Malignant childhood cancer;cancer in a child;cancer in children;child with cancer;childhood malignancy;children with cancer;pediatric cancer;pediatric malignancy;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm	BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE	HOUSTON	TX	UNITED STATES	HELEN E HESLOP	OCC	Hasnaa  Shafik	470361	$250k to $499k	470361	8-Sep-2020	1-Jul-2007	30-Jun-2025	PAR-17-095	CCDI
