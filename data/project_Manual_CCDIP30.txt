project	3P30CA008748-54S3	P30CA008748	10243057	2020	Cancer Center Support Grant	grant	ABSTRACT Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) is a free-standing NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center dedicated to improving the standards of cancer treatment, prevention and control. MSK's research programs are grouped into three categories: Basic Research (Regulation of Cell Behavior, Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Genomic Integrity, and Structural and Chemical Biology); Bridge Research (Cancer Biology and Experimental Pathology, Experimental Therapeutics, Immunology and Transplantation, and Imaging and Radiation Sciences); and Patient-Oriented Research (Clinical Research and Population Science Research). The programs are designed to optimize the use of a large patient population and an extensive, multi-disciplinary staff of clinical and laboratory-based investigators. MSK seeks to encourage the application of scientific discoveries in a way that advances the prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of the many forms of cancer that are relevant to the population in our catchment area. Scientific work in the 10 research programs depends on services provided by 26 core facilities. We are requesting funding from the Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) for 20 of these core facilities. Over the next five years, MSK will continue to enhance its clinical and research facilities and its research and training programs in emerging research areas. Support is requested to provide developmental funding for the support of newly recruited investigators in computational biology, to support cross-disciplinary pilot projects in population science research, and to support the core facilities.

The goal of the Knight is to perform cancer-focused research and to convert these findings into treatments and prevention strategies to improve outcomes for cancer patients. The OHSU Knight Cancer Institute has 139 members who belong to four scientific programs - Cancer Biology, Translational Oncology, Quantitative Oncology, and Cancer Prevention and Control and utilize six well-established shared resources - Flow Cytometry, Proteomics, Advanced Multiscale Microscopy, Integrated Genomics, BioLibrary & Pathology, and Biostatistics. The 139 Knight members are supported by $87.6 million in total extramural funding, $42.9 million of which is from the NCI. In the current funding period, members have published 1,139 cancer focused, peer-reviewed publications, of which 24% were intra-programmatic, 15% inter-programmatic, and 62% externally collaborative. In 2015 a total of 481 patients were enrolled on therapeutic treatment trials, representing over 10% of our new patient population. OHSU is the only academic medical center in Oregon and the Knight Cancer Institute is the only NCI-designated cancer center in the state. The Knight's catchment area is defined as the entire state of Oregon. Our research efforts are targeted to populations and cancers that are unique to our catchment area and includes evaluating populations in our catchment area that are more likely to diagnosed with late-stage cancers. Serving as the advanced oncology care facility for the state, the Knight brings depth and breadth to basic laboratory research; clinical research, including early phase clinical trials; and prevention, control, and population-based research with training programs for cancer researchers and health care professionals. In the current funding period we have recruited 32 new investigators, including four Associate Directors, completely restructured the leadership committees and the programmatic structure of the Knight to facilitate intra- and inter-programmatic interactions and to accelerate progress in achieving our goals. This has led to a significant increase in cancer focus, an increase in NCI funding, and enhanced collaborations as demonstrated by publications and collaborative grants. Given our growth and accomplishments in the current funding period, we request consideration for continued funding and feel we are well positioned for consideration of comprehensive status.

Houston is the 4th largest city in the United States with a very diverse population and Harris County is one of the most rapidly growing in the country. The DLDCCC Catchment Area has expanded from the core of Harris county to include the 8 surrounding counties which comprise the Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), representing a diverse population of more than 7 million individuals (this population is greater than 35 states). The DLDCCC is a matrix center with BCM as the lead partner with 4 hospital affiliates, Texas Children's, the DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Ben Taub Hospital, and the new Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center as formal affiliates. The DLDCCC received NCI designation in 2007 and comprehensive designation in 2014 and through our evaluation and planning process and recommendations from our EAC and internal committees, we have since made significant progress strengthening our scientific programs. 53 new cancer faculty have been recruited to the DLDCCC which now has 192 Research members, 78 Clinical members and 18 Adjunct members. Our cancer-relevant peer reviewed research funding now exceeds $169 million, with more than $49 million ($34M direct) coming from the NCI. Several important scientific accomplishments have been made that have an impact in our Catchment Area and globally. The DLDCCC comprises 7 research programs: Cell Signaling and Metabolism, Mechanism of Cancer Evolution, Nuclear Receptor, Transcription and Chromatin Biology, Breast Cancer, Cancer Cell and Gene Therapy, Cancer Prevention and Population Science, and Pediatric Cancer. Significant investments have strengthened the 10 Shared Resources, which offer leading technologies. A new shared resource in Advanced In Vivo Cancer Models further enhances our capabilities. The Clinical Protocol and Data Management Core has been significantly enhanced and accruals to clinical trials have increased. Accrual of racial and ethnic minorities is outstanding. The Office of Outreach and Health Disparities which drives COE disseminates new information and services to the community, especially the underserved. Training and education have been integrated into our Programs through the CRCE core. In this renewal, we ask for increased funding for our 10 Shared Resources and other expanded activities important to our mission and goals.	cancer prevention;Community Outreach;cell mediated therapies;cell-based therapy;cellular therapy;Cell Therapy;Malignant Cell;cancer cell;programs;Scientist;Clinic;Source;Country;collegiate;college;Medical center;Education and Training;Training and Education;Clinics or Hospitals;Clinics and Hospitals;data management;early detection;Early Diagnosis;metropolitan;member;Basic Research;Basic Science;outreach;outreach program;cancer education;Cancer Treatment;Malignant Neoplasm Therapy;Malignant Neoplasm Treatment;anti-cancer therapy;anticancer therapy;cancer therapy;disparity in health;health disparity;Institution;preventing;prevent;Instruction and Outreach;Training and Outreach;Tutoring and Outreach;Education and Outreach;NCI-Designated Cancer Center;Population Sciences;Resource Sharing;in vivo;National Cancer Burden;Cancer Burden;Cancer Center;CCSG;Cancer Center Support Grant;CancerModel;Cancer Model;Catchment Area;Clinical Data;Clinical Sciences;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Patient outcome;Patient-Centered Outcomes;Patient-Focused Outcomes;scientific accomplishments;scientific advances;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Translational Science;translation research;Translational Research;Process;cell metabolism;cellular metabaolism;Cellular Metabolic Process;under served population;underserved people;Underserved Population;next generation;new approaches;novel approaches;novel strategy;novel strategies;Population;ethnic minority;ethnic minority population;multidisciplinary;racial and ethnic;implementation science;clinical care;Breast Cancer therapy;racial minority;cancer survival;recruit;Infrastructure;Biology;Malignant Neoplasms;Cancers;Malignant Tumor;malignancy;neoplasm/cancer;Child;0-11 years old;Child Youth;Children (0-21);children;childrens';youngster;Chromatin;Cities;Clinical Protocols;Clinical Trials;Communities;Diagnosis;Disease;Disorder;Ethnic group;ethnicity group;Evolution;Faculty;Future;gene therapy;DNA Therapy;Gene Transfer Clinical;Genetic Intervention;gene-based therapy;genetic therapy;genomic therapy;Patient Care;Patient Care Delivery;Geographic Locations;Geographic Area;Geographic Region;Geographical Location;geographic site;Goals;Health;Hospitals;Industry;Information Services;Institutes;Investments;Laboratories;Lead;Pb element;heavy metal Pb;heavy metal lead;Medicine;Mission;Morbidity - disease rate;Morbidity;mortality;United States National Institutes of Health;NIH;National Institutes of Health;Peer Review;Physicians;Play;Population Growth;Recommendation;Research;Role;social role;Signal Transduction;Cell Communication and Signaling;Cell Signaling;Intracellular Communication and Signaling;Signal Transduction Systems;Signaling;biological signal transduction;Technology;Texas;Genetic Transcription;Gene Transcription;RNA Expression;Transcription;Translating;United States;Veterans;Vision;Sight;visual function;Asians;oriental;County;Hispanic Populations;Latino Population;Spanish Origin;hispanic community;Hispanics;diverse populations;heterogeneous population;population diversity;Population Heterogeneity;Uninsured;improved;Area;Clinical;Research Peer Review;Nuclear Receptors;Evaluation;Individual;Interdisciplinary Research;Multidisciplinary Collaboration;Multidisciplinary Research;Interdisciplinary Study;Funding;Childhood Cancers;Malignant Childhood Tumor;Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm;Malignant Pediatric Tumor;Malignant childhood cancer;cancer in a child;cancer in children;child with cancer;childhood malignancy;children with cancer;pediatric cancer;pediatric malignancy;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm	BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE	HOUSTON	TX	UNITED STATES	HELEN E HESLOP	OCC	Hasnaa Shafik	470361	<$1M	470361	08-Sep-2020	1-Jul-2007	30-Jun-2025	PAR-17-095	CCDI	True
project	3P30CA168524-09S3	P30CA168524	10244447	2020	Cancer Center Support Grant	Grant	"Overall – Project Summary The University of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC) is a matrix cancer center that includes: the University of Kansas Medical Center campuses in Kansas City, Wichita and Salina, the University of Kansas in Lawrence and via consortium agreement, the Stowers Institute for Medical Research and Children's Mercy Kansas City. In 2015, 187 members of KUCC accounted for $13.4M of NCI funding and a total of $61.2M in overall cancer- related funding, an increase of $10M during the previous funding period. Roy A. Jensen, MD, who is supported by a strong, nationally recognized leadership team, leads KUCC. Over the last four years substantial progress has been made broadening partnerships with communities throughout the KUCC catchment area, boosting recruitment of physician-scientists, augmenting clinical research and early-phase clinical trials, advancing education for the next generation of scientists and health care providers and heightening influence for KUCC researchers in the national scientific community. KUCC has established four specific aims to ensure KUCC leads in the fight against cancer: 1. Leverage unique institutional and regional assets to become a leading academic institution for transforming discoveries from the laboratory into new anticancer drug therapies; 2. Provide the optimal environment to focus the power of precision medicine, basic science inquiry, drug discovery and development, and behavioral interventions to decrease cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality; 3. Be a nationally recognized leader in partnering with key stakeholders, community advocates and regional leaders to develop, promote, and foster the adoption and implementation of research-based cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment, control, and survivorship practices throughout the KUCC catchment area to mitigate the impact of cancer; and 4. Provide leadership in envisioning, developing and implementing a thoughtful, comprehensive strategy to educate the next generation of physician-scientists and allied investigators in cancer research, treatment, prevention and control. To accomplish these goals KUCC has four research programs: Cancer Biology, Cancer Control and Population Health, Cancer Prevention and Survivorship, and Drug Discovery, Delivery and Experimental Therapeutics. In addition, KUCC supports the Clinical Trials Office, five established shared resources - Biospecimen, Biostatistics and Informatics, Clinical Pharmacology, Lead Development and Optimization and Transgenic and Gene-Targeting – along with three developing shared resources – Cell Authentication and Pathogen Screening, Health Communications Research and Nutrition."	<Adoption><Behavior Therapy><Behavior Conditioning Therapy><Behavior Modification><Behavior Treatment><Behavioral Conditioning Therapy><Behavioral Modification><Behavioral Therapy><Behavioral Treatment><Conditioning Therapy><behavior intervention><behavioral intervention><Biometry><Biometrics><Biostatistics><Malignant Neoplasms><Cancers><Malignant Tumor><malignancy><neoplasm/cancer><Cells><Cell Body><Child><0-11 years old><Child Youth><Children (0-21)><children><childrens'><youngster><Cities><Clinical Research><Clinical Study><Clinical Trials><Communities><Diagnosis><Pharmacotherapy><Drug Therapy><drug treatment><Education><Educational aspects><Environment><Goals><Growth and Development function><Growth and Development><Health Personnel><Health Care Providers><Healthcare Providers><Healthcare worker><health care personnel><health care worker><health provider><health workforce><healthcare personnel><medical personnel><treatment provider><Incidence><Institutes><Kansas><Laboratories><Lead><Pb element><heavy metal Pb><heavy metal lead><Leadership><Morbidity - disease rate><Morbidity><mortality><nutrition><Patients><Clinical Pharmacology><Physicians><Quality of life><QOL><Research Personnel><Investigators><Researchers><survivorship><Universities><Vision><Sight><visual function><Medical Research><Advocacy><base><improved><Ensure><Training><Fostering><Gene Targeting><Funding><cancer prevention><Therapeutic><programs><Scientist><Consult><Medical center><American><Informatics><transgenic><Transgenic Organisms><member><Agreement><Basic Research><Basic Science><Prevention><Modeling><drug development><Cancer Treatment><Malignant Neoplasm Therapy><Malignant Neoplasm Treatment><anti-cancer therapy><anticancer therapy><cancer therapy><drug discovery><Experimental Therapies><Investigational Treatments><experimental therapeutic agents><experimental therapeutics><Investigational Therapies><Institution><Advocate><Health Communication><Center for Cancer Research><NCI Center for Cancer Research><Population-based research><Population-level research><Population Research><Resource Sharing><Cancer Biology><National Cancer Burden><Cancer Burden><Cancer Center><CCSG><Cancer Center Support Grant><Cancer Control Science><Cancer Control><Cancer Research Programs><Cancer Research Project><Cancer Survivorship><Catchment Area><Communication Research><Comprehensive Cancer Center><Translational Science><translation research><Translational Research><developmental><Development><fight against><treatment organization><implementation research><Wichita><anti-cancer research><cancer research><anticancer research><next generation><intervention efficacy><therapeutic efficacy><therapeutically effective><therapy efficacy><Treatment Efficacy><cost effective><pathogen><multidisciplinary approach><interdisciplinary approach><new therapeutic approach><new therapeutic intervention><new therapeutic strategies><new therapy approaches><novel therapeutic approach><novel therapy approach><novel therapeutic intervention><clinical care><population health><screening><precision-based medicine><precision medicine><new anti-cancer agent><new anticancer agent><new anticancer drug><new antineoplastic><new cancer drug><novel anti-cancer agent><novel anti-cancer drug><novel anticancer agent><novel antineoplastic><novel cancer drug><novel anticancer drug><recruit><care costs><early clinical trial><early phase clinical trial>	UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER	KANSAS CITY	KS	UNITED STATES	ROY A.

project	3P30CA014089-45S6	P30CA014089	10261622	2020	USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (Core) Grant	Grant	"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Molecular Genetics Program has been continuously approved through the NCI CCSG since the USC Norris first received NCI designation over 35 years ago. This Program has always been distinguished nationally for its strength in DNA replication and DNA repair, with an emphasis on applying discoveries toward cancer chemotherapy. During the project period, Preet Chaudhary joined Michael Lieber as Co-Leader to add depth in translation and oversee a new theme on the molecular genetics of cancers associated with infection by HHV8, including the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of these cancers. The Program has three integrated aims: 1) DNA replication, cell cycle, and cell proliferation in genetic instability; 2) DNA repair and recombination in genetic instability; and 3) viral oncogenesis with an emphasis on HHV8. Lymphoid malignancies are used as a disease model used by Program members for all three aims. Members continue to be highly interactive within and across themes and across program boundaries. The 39 Program members, who come from three schools and 13 departments, have $11.4M in peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of which 18% is from NCI, 61% from other NIH sources, and 8% from other peer-reviewed funding sources. The Program is highly productive with 439 publications of which 21% are inter-programmatic, 15% intra-programmatic and 25% inter-institutional. Program Leaders organize retreats and mini-symposia several times per year to cross-fertilize research within and across Programs while remaining watchful to ensure a high level of member crosstalk. This has led to high success in securing new P01s that are intra- and inter-programmatic, while also cross-cutting thematically. Examples include renewal of an NCI P01 on understanding human DNA polymerase active sites and development of new chemotherapeutics (Goodman, McKenna, Warshel), and a new NCI P01 on viral oncogenesis by KSHV (HHV8) (Jung, Feng, Gao). Members have been particularly successful in seeking new cancer drug therapies, which has been achieved with the Translational and Clinical Sciences Program."
