project	3U24CA055727-26S1	U24CA055727	10240899	2020	Childhood Cancer Survivor Study	Grant	ABSTRACT\nThe Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary collaborative research\nresource established to systematically evaluate long-term outcomes among children diagnosed with cancer who\nsurvived five or more years from diagnosis. With the recent successful expansion of the cohort to include\nsurvivors diagnosed and treated over three decades (1970-1999), the CCSS is the world's largest established\nopen resource for survivorship research with 35,923 eligible survivors available for investigation of late mortality,\nand 24,368 participants who have contributed health-related and quality of life outcomes. The resource includes\ncomprehensive annotation of treatment exposure, ongoing longitudinal follow-up and an established\nbiorepository, from which genotyping (SNP array) and sequencing (whole exome) of almost 6,000 survivors will\nbe available for investigators for identification of genetic susceptibility for disease- and treatment-induced late\neffects. Extensive use by the research community has resulted in: 264 published or in press manuscripts now\ncited over 12,600 times; 229 presented abstracts; 42 investigator-initiated grants, totaling $37.1 million in\nfunding; utilization by a diverse group of 673 investigators; training of 63 young investigators; conduct of six\nrandomized trials; increased knowledge to inform exposure-based clinical care guidelines; and a highly\nsuccessful model for multiple national and international collaborative initiatives of pediatric cancer survivorship\nresearch. During the next five years, activities will focus on maintaining, enhancing and promoting use of this\nsingular resource. The overarching goal of the CCSS resource is to increase the conduct of innovative and high\nimpact research related to pediatric cancer survivorship.

project	1F30CA260911-01	F30CA260911	10233119	2021	Thymic PD-1 blockade mediates the anti-tumor immune response in pediatric high-grade glioma	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nProgrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, are highly expressed in human and murine\nthymus. Despite this knowledge, the function of the PD-1 signaling pathway during T cell development has been\nseverely understudied. In the past decade, immunotherapies inhibiting the PD-1:PD-L1 axis have produced\nremarkable improvements in the clinical management of several malignancies, at least in part by restoring T cell\nreceptor (TCR) signaling within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, because TCR\nsignaling is essential for thymocyte development, we postulate PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors may have profound effects\non the function and specificity of newly generated T cells. These thymus-specific actions may highlight a key\nunexplored mechanism by which PD-1 blockade elicits anti-tumor immune responses. Leveraging this pathway\nfor pediatric cancer patients may be particularly beneficial considering their high rate of thymic T cell production.\nOur preliminary data illustrate that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) administered in conjunction with anti-PD-1\ntherapy expands the T cell pool and helps overcome treatment-resistance in murine glioblastoma. This may\nsuggest anti-PD-1 therapy acts within the thymus to promote the proliferation and maturation of HSC-derived\nthymocytes. Importantly, pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG) is the prevailing cause of cancer-related death in\nchildren which emphasizes the need for new therapies. Thus it is our priority to investigate this novel pathway\nwith the goal of improving the standard of care for pediatric HGG and other childhood tumors. Our objective is\nto characterize how inhibiting PD-1 signaling modifies thymocyte development in health and HGG. The central\nhypothesis of this proposal is that PD-1 inhibition increases thymic T cell production and promotes the positive\nselection, or survival, of tumor-specific TCRs. Aim 1 will determine the impact of PD-1 blockade on the\nproliferation, selection, and output of developing thymocytes in healthy and glioma-bearing mice. Aim 2 will\nassess the thymic contribution towards the therapeutic response in the context of PD-1 inhibiton and HSC\ntransfer. This work is significant because no prior study has investigated how thymus-specific PD-1 blockade\nimpacts anti-tumor immune responses. The results from this study have the potential to substantially influence\nclinical decision making and treatment regimens for pediatric HGG patients. This project is innovative because\nit will utilize nontransgenic mouse models to more accurately define how PD-1 inhibition affects thymus\nphysiology in health and disease. In summary this proposal will comprehensively characterize how the PD-1\npathway modulates T cell development and will investigate a novel thymic mechanism that may revolutionize\nour understanding of anti-PD-1 therapy in cancer.

project	1R01CA241452-01A1	R01CA241452	9972624	2020	Pathogenesis of ETV6-Related Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nAs the initiating genetic events in tumorigenesis, germline variants in cancer predisposing genes perturb cell\ngrowth and differentiation and set the stage for malignant transformation. Accordingly, the study of cancer\npredisposing genes and their associated hereditary syndromes provides critical insights into normal physiology\nand cancer biology. By investigating families with autosomal dominant transmission of thrombocytopenia and B-\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we and others identified pathogenic germline variants affecting ETV6,\nthe gene encoding the ETS variant 6 transcriptional repressor. Subsequently, we sequenced germline samples\nfrom 4,405 children with B-ALL and detected similar variants in 0.5% of patients. Further association studies\nrevealed a significant 22.94-fold enrichment of pathogenic ETV6 variants in this ALL cohort compared to 134,187\nnon-ALL controls in gnomAD (P= 2.2 × 10-16). These data firmly support our overall premise that pathogenic\ngermline ETV6 variants predispose to childhood ALL. To better understand how germline ETV6 variants\npromote leukemogenesis, we used in vitro assays to interrogate their effects on the functions of the encoded\nETV6 protein. Notably, each of the pathogenic ETV6 variants examined significantly reduced ETV6 transcription\nrepressor activity, impaired ETV6 DNA binding capacity and mis-localized ETV6 to the cytoplasm. In parallel, we\ngenerated a novel mouse model harboring a recurrent B-ALL-associated Etv6 variant (Etv6R355X). Preliminary\nstudies of Etv6R355X/+ mice reveal significant perturbations in early B cell development, as well as hematopoietic\nstem and progenitor cell (HSPC) number and function. Finally, we generated isogenic induced pluripotent stem\ncell (iPSC) lines harboring pathogenic ETV6 variants, which generate dysplastic megakaryocytes, similar to\nETV6 variant positive patients. Based on these results, we hypothesize that ETV6 variants predispose to\nALL by perturbing key transcriptional programs that impair hematopoietic development. In this proposal,\nwe will make use of our unique model systems to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize\nthe hematopoietic compartments of humans and mice that do or do not harbor pathogenic germline ETV6\nvariants. We will examine whether WT and ETV6 variant-positive iPSCs or mouse hematopoietic progenitors\nproperly differentiate along various lineages. To establish how germline ETV6 variants influence gene expression\nin developing hematopoietic progenitors, in Aim 2 we will use RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing to explore\ntranscriptional landscapes and identify putative ETV6 target genes in mouse and iPSC-derived B progenitors\nand HSPC harboring WT or variant ETV6. Finally, in Aim 3 we will perform comprehensive whole genome and\nRNA-sequencing of B-ALL samples to elucidate the somatic genetic lesions that function in concert with germline\nETV6 variants to drive B-leukemogenesis. We will use in vitro and in vivo approaches to assess the leukemia-\npromoting effects of these second hits. This project will provide new insights into the influence of germline\ngenetic variation on hematopoiesis and development of B-ALL, the most common childhood cancer.

project	1R03CA251976-01A1	R03CA251976	10287498	2021	Targeted therapy against TERT oncogene-rearranged neuroblastoma	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nBackground. TERT oncogene rearrangement with transcriptional super-enhancers leads to substantial TERT\nover-expression and neuroblastoma in high-risk neuroblastoma patients. Telomerase inhibitors show little\nanticancer effects and cause life-threatening side effects in childhood brain cancer patients in clinical trials.\nThe transcriptional kinases CDK7 and CDK9 play critical roles in super-enhancer-associated oncogene\ntranscriptional initiation, pause release and elongation respectively, and CKIα induce p53 protein degradation.\nThe CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51 suppresses super-enhancer-associated oncogene expression and\nactivates p53 protein expression, resulting in leukemia regression in mice with no toxicity to normal tissues.\nPreliminary Data. We have found that CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-knockdown with shRNAs or treatment with the\nCDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51 considerably reduced TERT gene expression and MDM2 protein\nexpression, activated p53 protein expression, and induced substantial apoptosis in TERT oncogene-\nrearranged neuroblastoma, but not normal cells. Analysis of a RNA sequencing gene expression-patient\nprognosis dataset from 493 neuroblastoma patients, showed that high levels of CDK7 gene expression in\nhuman tumor tissues positively correlated with high levels of TERT gene expression, and that high levels of\nCDK7 and CKIα expression in human neuroblastoma tissues correlated with poor patient prognosis.\nSpecific Aims. (1) To identify the critical roles of CDK7 and CDK9 in inducing TERT gene transcriptional\ninitiation, elongation and over-expression and CKIα in inducing p53 protein degradation in TERT-rearranged\nneuroblastoma cells; (2) To identify the critical roles of CDK7, CDK9 and CKIα in TERT-rearranged\nneuroblastoma cell proliferation and survival in vitro and tumor progression in vivo; (3) To define the anticancer\nefficacy of the CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51 against TERT-rearranged neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo.\nOutcomes and Significance. We hope to demonstrate that CDK7 and CDK9 co-operatively induce TERT\ngene transcriptional initiation, pause release, elongation and over-expression, and CKIα induces p53 protein\ndegradation; that CDK7, CDK9 and CKIα co-operatively induce TERT-rearranged neuroblastoma cell\nproliferation and survival in vitro and tumor progression in vivo; and that the CDK7/CDK9/CKIα co-inhibitor A51\nefficiently blocks TERT gene transcriptional initiation, pause release, elongation and expression, activates p53\nprotein expression, induces neuroblastoma cell apoptosis in vitro, and blocks tumor progression and causes\ntumor regression in mice xenografted with TERT-rearranged neuroblastoma cell lines or patient-derived\nneuroblastoma tissues. As A51 is currently in clinical trials in leukemia patients, completion of this project will\nprovide the vital evidence for clinical trials of A51 therapy in patients with TERT gene-rearranged\nneuroblastoma, against which no targeted therapy is now available for, or has ever be tested in, clinical trials.

project	5UM1CA081457-22	UM1CA081457	10170275	2021	Pediatric Brain Tumor ConsortiumA multi-institutional consortium devoted to novel phase I and II clinical evaluations of experimental treatment approaches for pediatric CNS tumors.	Grant	PBTC Project Summary/Abstract\nThe primary goal of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) is to rapidly and effectively\ncontribute to the understanding and cure of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors\nthrough innovative, multidisciplinary and multi-institutional prospective clinical trials. PBTC clinical\ntrial development is not only based upon known prognostic factors but also upon an evolving\nunderstanding of pediatric brain tumor biology. The PBTC will continue to utilize innovative study\ndesigns and analyses based on state-of-the-art statistical science. Novel clinical trials will\nincorporate relevant correlative pharmacology, biology, neuroimaging, immunologic and\ngenomics studies in an effort to define and integrate these modalities into a better understanding\nof pediatric CNS tumors. These goals will be accomplished through a close and continued\npartnership with the member institutions' basic and translational scientists as well as the clinical\ntrial experts. In addition, the PBTC welcomes partnerships with investigators outside the\nconsortium providing scientific, laboratory and regulatory support for innovative and high priority\nclinical trials. The PBTC will continue to maintain and grow its relationship with the National\nCancer Institute (NCI) and its large network of adult and pediatric groups as well as with\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. One of the most important goals of the PBTC is to\nsuccessfully complete focused phase I and II clinical trials of novel agents and treatment\napproaches that can be then be translated into large prospective phase II and III studies overseen\nby the Children's Oncology Group (COG). The overarching long-term goal is to improve survival\noutcome and quality of life for children with CNS tumor diagnoses that so often lead to high\nmorbidity and mortality such as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, high-grade gliomas, infant\nembryonal tumors, refractory medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and low-grade gliomas. To this\nend, the PBTC will continue to focus upon introducing novel molecularly-targeted agents via\ninnovative trials to assess the presence of the target in tumor and surrogate tissue, evaluate the\nability of the agent to down-regulate its signaling target and better correlate pharmacokinetic and\npharmacodynamic endpoints with toxicities and clinical responses. The PBTC will also continue\nto explore therapeutic opportunities for pediatric brain tumors through immunotherapeutic\ninterventions as well as via local delivery of treatments. By focusing on the most common solid\ntumor in children which also accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths in\npediatrics, the PBTC will continue to support the NCI's mission of helping all people live longer,\nhealthier lives through its contributions to cancer research and identification of better treatments.

project	3U24HD090743-06S2	U24HD090743	10479444	2021	Genome Sequencing in support of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program	Grant	Project Summary/Abstract\nWe propose to continue to provide data generation and processing activities that will enrich a\ngenomic data resource to propel pediatric disease research and in particular for the study of\nBrian Tumors. Key elements for success will be the provision of high quality genome sequence\ndata on well-phenotyped patients and their families; the collection and accessibility of data to\nthe research community in an intuitive manner; and the integration of genetic data with\nphenotypic information in the context of this program and comparison to other large data\nresources. We propose to continue as a Kids First Sequencing Center at the Broad Institute as\nwe have done for the past five years for the program and as we have also done in support of\nother large flagship NIH genome projects. Our center brings the domain expertise in high\nthroughput data generation, processing and analysis, and disease gene discovery required to\nmeet the objectives of the Kids First Program. We will apply deep, high-quality whole genome\nsequencing and RNA sequencing data on selected samples. We will be flexible to work closely\nand accommodate the needs and interests of selected X01 Investigators. We will participate in\nthe evaluation of these data types and their overall impact on discovery and scientific output of\nthe program. A key feature of our center is our implementation of a robust analytical framework\nfor variant assessment and disease gene discovery, which builds on Broad investigators’ world-\nleading roles in statistical genetics, functional annotation, and clinical variant interpretation as\nwell as access to exome and genome data from hundreds of thousands of samples sequenced\nat Broad. This has enabled us to build a systematic pipeline for gene discovery that will be\nmade freely available to the Kids First program. With data produced and processed in a\nconsistent way, we can offer seamless integration of Kids First data into our analytic framework.\nFor many of the diseases targeted by the pediatric research community, confident discovery of\ncausal genes will require aggregation of cases across centers around the world. We will partner\nwith the Kids First Data Resource Center in a variety of ways to ensure that the program is well-\naligned with other large-scale resource generation projects. With this we hope to support Kids\nFirst as a whole and establish standards for data sharing in clinical genomics, accelerating\ncollaboration and facilitating robust disease gene discovery.

project	1K08CA259610-01	K08CA259610	10192359	2021	Developing novel CAR T cell designs using combinatorial antigen detection	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCandidate: The applicant, Greg Allen, MD/PhD, is a medical oncologist at UCSF with a long-term goal to lead\nan independent laboratory-based translational research program focused on cellular therapies. The K08\napplication is key for his career development, providing him with (1) mentorship from a diverse team of scientists\nand physician-scientists, (2) formal didactics to expand his knowledge in clinical trial design and tumor\nimmunology, (3) extensive hands-on training in the translation of newly developed cellular therapies to early\nphase clinical trials and (4) data collection for an R01 application.\nResearch: CAR T cells are a game-changing treatment for B cell malignancies — genetically reprogramming a\npatient's cytotoxic T cells allows them to recognize and clear tumor cells. Unfortunately for solid cancers the\ncurrent generation of CAR T cells have been ineffective – no simple single antigen targeted CAR is able to\nprecisely recognize and safely clear solid tumor cells. There is a clear unmet need for the design and\nimplementation of the next-generation of engineered cell therapies to overcome these challenges. The core\nhypothesis of this proposal is that combinatorial antigen recognition—the detection of tumor cells and tumor\nmicroenvironments using information from multiple antigens (with AND/OR/NOT gates) can provide a powerful\nsolution to the problem of precise recognition and allow the construction of more effective therapies.\nIn this project the first aim will investigate the use of AND gates to safely target pancreatic adenocarcinoma by\nrecognizing and overcoming the suppressive tumor-microenvironment seen in this disease. The second aim\nwill apply newly developed receptors that provide NOT gate functionality to avoid CNS toxicity seen with CAR T\ncells designed to target neuroblastoma.\nMentorship and Training: Dr. Allen's training will be accomplished through formal coursework and under direct\nmentorship of world leaders including Wendell Lim, PhD, chair of the Department of Molecular and Cellular\nPharmacology at UCSF who has extensive expertise in modular signaling platforms, synthetic biology and\ncellular therapy. Professor Lim has over his 20 years at UCSF mentored ~50 postdoctoral fellow as well as 4\nclinical fellows. Dr. Allen will be co-mentored by Dr. Larry Fong, MD, an expert in translational immunology and\nimmunotherapy who leads the Cancer Immunotherapy Program at UCSF and has extensive experience in\nhelping translational immunology researchers achieve independence.\nEnvironment: The candidate's training and research will be performed at the University of California, San\nFrancisco, which provides an exceptional research environment with state-of-art facilities and world-renowned\nfaculty. UCSF is dedicated to developing next-generation cell therapies and Dr. Allen will be part of the UCSF\nCell Design Institute (focused on cell engineering), the UCSF Center for Synthetic Immunology and the UCSF\nHelen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Transcriptional profiling has\nsubsequently identified four subgroups which include wingless/integrated (WNT)-activated, sonic hedgehog\n(SHH)-activated, Group 3, and Group 4. Each subtype differs in clinical prognoses, in which WNT tumors have\nbest outcomes, SHH and Group 4 have intermediate prognoses, and Group 3 have the worst outcomes.\nStandard therapeutic treatment of these tumors includes surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However, long-\nterm side-effects often result in negative side-effects for patients, as noted through global reductions in\nphysiological, psychological, and economic welfare of patients. Immunotherapy, given the success in adult\ntumors, is an attractive option as it may impart similar therapeutic success with potentially diminished adverse\nside-effects. Immunotherapies hinge on the relative abundance and cytolytic effector capacity of CD8+ T cells.\nActivation of these cells is dependent on both the immunogenicity of tumors and on priming by competent\nmigratory antigen presenting cells. Once migrated to tumors, relative antitumor success of T cells is dictated by\nthe capacity of cells to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor environment. T cells must also resist T cell\nexhaustion which results from the persistent antigenic environment of tumors. Establishment and propagation of\nthis exhaustive cell fate decision has been demonstrated to be intimately tied to epigenetics. Our preliminary\ndata shows striking differences in PD1hiCD8+ T cells between Group 3 and SHH preclinical tumor models, in\nwhich there is high infiltration of these T cells into Group 3 tumors and low infiltration into SHH tumors.\nConversely, we have observed significantly higher infiltration of PD1hiCD8+ T cells in the tumor-draining lymph\nnodes of SHH tumors expressing N-Myc as compared to Group 3 tumor-draining lymph nodes. Taken together,\nthis dichotomy may underscore differential therapeutic responsiveness, particularly in the presence of checkpoint\nblockade. In this proposal, we aim to investigate both tumor immunogenicity and T cell dysfunction as potential\nmechanisms underscoring these dichotomous T cell responses between medulloblastoma subgroups. In\nparticular, we will examine the inherent immunogenicity of tumors in vivo and determine if established epigenetic\nmechanisms of T cell exhaustion impacts the abundance and therapeutic responsiveness of T cells in Group 3\nand SHH medulloblastomas. The completion of these aims will add to a deeper understanding of the underlying\nbiological differences between the clinical outcomes of medulloblastoma subgroups, as well as inform studies\naimed at enhancing the efficacy of T cell-based therapeutics in medulloblastoma. Furthermore, the techniques\noutlined in this proposal will enhance the professional development of the applicant into becoming an\nindependent researcher capable of running their own research program at an academic institution.

project	1R01CA222518-01A1	R01CA222518	9973837	2020	Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis in AMKL	Grant	!\nProject Summary/Abstract\nFundamental analysis of the mechanisms of leukemogenesis is required in order to develop optimized\ntreatment approaches. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant RNA modification, plays key roles in\nRNA metabolism, transcript stability, and translation efficiency. Aberrant regulation of m6A writers and erasers\ncontributes to leukemogenesis, though the exact mechanisms how the methyltransferase machinery is altered\nin leukemia remains to be shown. Mutations in methyltransferase writers have not been identified to date, with\none exception: in the recurrent t(1;22) translocation in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) a component\nof the m6A writer machinery, RBM15, is fused with MKL1, a transcriptional cofactor of serum response factor\n(SRF). Understanding the mechanism by which the RBM15-MKL1 (RM) fusion protein causes leukemia will shed\nlight on the role of disordered m6A RNA methylation in leukemogenesis, specifically AMKL but also AML and to\ncancer in general. We hypothesize that for RM-associated AMKL to develop, the MKL1 domain aberrantly targets\nRBM15 activity to sites of SRF binding and that RBM15 recruits the m6A writer complex to associated RNAs,\naltering m6A mRNA methylation and expression of genes that are required for transformation and/or are\nimportant for megakaryocyte fate commitment and maturation. We propose focused, unbiased genome-wide\nstudies to determine how the m6A epitranscriptome and the SRF transcriptional networks are coopted in RBM15-\nMKL1 AMKL. The functional effects of candidate target genes common to the genomic approaches (m6A RNA\nimmunoprecipitation, chromatin mapping, RNA stability assays, and mapping of the translatome) as well as the\nrelevance of critical domains in RM-mediated leukemogenesis will be tested with assays of growth, differentiation\nand oncogene dependence in RM-induced murine AMKL as well as primary human AMKL patient derived\nxenotransplants (PDX). The studies are highly clinically relevant as they address a unique mechanism causative\nof AMKL via comprehensive analysis of fundamental biologic mechanisms, and will reveal previously unidentified\nregulation of the epitranscriptome that may be a novel shared oncogenic mechanism in AML and other cancers.\nThe proposed approaches are multifaceted, using cell lines as well as genetically engineered animal models,\nand primary human and murine leukemia samples. The studies will contribute to our understanding of\nleukemogenesis by elucidating the direct role of a component of the m6A RNA methylase complex in leukemia\nshedding light on the broader role of m6A mRNA modifications in AML.\n!

Relatively few driver mutations\nactually alter the function of proteins in tumor cells, whereas most mutations are considered to be functionally\nneutral passenger mutations. Over the past decade, the search for cancer driver mutations has focused on\ncoding regions and several mutational significance algorithms have been developed for coding mutations. The\ncontribution of mutations in noncoding regulatory regions to tumor formation largely remains unknown and\ncurrent mutational significance algorithms are not designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions, due\nto biological differences between coding and noncoding mutations. The emerging availability of large whole-\ngenome sequencing datasets (e.g. PCAWG and HMF datasets) creates an ample opportunity to develop new\nmutational significance algorithms that are particularly designed for the interpretation of noncoding regions.\nRecently, we have developed a new statistical approach that identifies driver mutations in coding regions based\non the nucleotide context. Critically, consideration of the nucleotide context around mutations does not require\nprior knowledge for functional consequences associated with these mutations. Hence, we hypothesize that\ngeneralizing our nucleotide context model to noncoding regions will uncover novel noncoding driver\nmutations that cannot be detected using the mutational significance approaches currently available. For\nthis purpose, we will develop a statistical framework that incorporates the biological differences between coding\nand noncoding mutations and that is specifically designed to detect driver mutations in noncoding regions.\nSpecifically, we will consider the context-dependent distribution of passenger mutations, modeling of the\nbackground mutation rate, accurately partition the background mutation rate, model the sequence composition\nof the reference genome, and account for coverage fluctuation. We will then combine these statistical\ncomponents by computing an independent product of their underlying probabilities. We will derive a significance\np-value using a Monte-Carlo simulation approach, and use FDR for multiple hypothesis test correction. This\nstrategy will allow us to accurately estimate the significance of somatic mutations in noncoding genomic regions.\nWe will next apply this statistical framework to whole-genome sequencing data of 5,523 tumor patients, thereby\nderiving a comprehensive list of candidate driver mutations in noncoding regions. Finally, we will investigate\nwhether noncoding mutations are overrepresented in transcription factor binding sites, regulate gene expression\nlevels, induce alternative splicing, or affect epigenomic states. Upon the completion of this project, we will have\ndeveloped and applied a statistical framework for discovery of significant somatic mutations in noncoding\nregions, and defined the mutational landscape of the non-coding cancer genome. All aspects of the methods\ndeveloped and applied in this project will be made open source and developed in an online platform.

Our preclinical work[1] identified\nBET-bromodomain inhibitors as a potentially promising new class of drugs for children with medulloblastoma\n(MB) and other MYC-driven cancers, providing rationale to evaluate these agents in clinical trials. However,\ntreatment with BET inhibitor (BETi) alone is unlikely to be sufficient for a cure, with most tumors evolving to\nacquire resistance to single-agent targeted therapies. An attractive strategy to overcoming therapy resistance\nis to identify and exploit new vulnerabilities that exist in drug-tolerant cells. Metabolic pathways are of particular\ninterest in this context as they often rely on few essential enzymes, are frequently “rewired” in cancer cells vs.\nnormal cells, support and drive adaptive resistance to drug, provide essential survival capabilities, and can be\neasily targeted with pharmacologic inhibitors[3]. Our previous work applied an integrative genomics approach to\nidentify genes and pathways mediating BETi response in MB[2]. These studies revealed that MYC-driven MB\ncells with acquired resistance to BETi reinstate transcription of essential genes suppressed by drug and exhibit\nchanges in cell-state and new vulnerabilities not present in drug-sensitive cells. We now have a growing body\nof evidence showing that BET inhibition downregulates the expression of key lipid metabolism genes and\nmetabolism-related signaling pathways, and that MB cells with adaptive resistance to BETi differentially\nexpress and exhibit preferential dependency on specific lipid metabolic genes and transcriptional regulators.\nThese findings led me to hypothesize that metabolic reprogramming creates novel vulnerabilities in BETi drug-\ntolerant MB cells that can be targeted to overcome resistance. The studies described herein will characterize\nthe altered lipid metabolism of BETi-resistant MB cells, assess the impact of BETi-driven metabolic rewiring on\ncell signaling and the resistance phenotype, and investigate the possibility of exploiting lipid metabolic\ndependencies as a novel approach to overcome resistance to BETi-targeted therapy.

DIPG 2-year survival rate is <10% due to its unresectable tumor location and resistance to\nradiation and available therapeutics. This emphasizes the need for better understanding of the underlying\npathogenesis of DIPG to identify new therapeutic vulnerabilities. Histone H3 Lys27Met (K27M) mutations are a\nunifying molecular feature observed ~80% of DIPGs and pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (DMG). The high\nfrequency of K27M and their exclusivity to childhood DIPG and DMG suggests K27M has a unique selective\nadvantage in a distinct spatiotemporal setting for tumorigenesis. Understanding the regional selectively of K27M\nand its phenotypic and molecular effects will further elucidate oncogenic mechanisms and help identify new and\nbetter treatment options. The Baker laboratory developed a genetically engineered mouse model harboring a\nconditional knock-in of K27M into the endogenous H3f3a locus which allows the mutation to be studied in a\nphysiologically and developmentally relevant manner. With this model, we showed K27M cooperates with Pdgfra\nactivation and or p53 loss to drive spontaneous gliomagenesis selectively in brainstem and hindbrain locations.\nK27M causes dramatic loss of the repressive H3K27me3 but only specific changes in gene expression related\nto neurodevelopment. Single-cell RNA-seq of human K27M DIPGs reveals oligodendrocyte precursors (OPC)\nare the main proliferative and stem-like population present in DIPGs. We have also showed that depletion of\nK27M in patient-derived xenografts induces oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation signatures, decreases stemness\nsignatures, and reduces proliferation and tumor growth. In total, these studies indicate a role for K27M in regional\nselectivity of brainstem tumorigenesis along with altered OL differentiation, promoting OPC-like state. However,\nmany questions still remain regarding K27M and DIPG. Why is K27M found almost exclusively in brainstem and\nmidline pediatric glioma? What are the oncogenic effects and mechanisms of K27M alone? I will utilize our K27M\nknock-in mice to dissect the regional effects of H3 K27M on glial development and tumorigenesis in vivo (Aim 1)\nand evaluate the regional K27M-mediated epigenetic and transcriptomic dysregulation in oligodendrocyte\ndevelopment to identify K27M DIPG dependencies (Aim 2). Through completion of these studies, we will gain\ninsights into the molecular mechanisms and spatiotemporal context of K27M that disrupt development and\npromote tumorigenesis which will help to direct therapeutic development to target the molecular programs\ninvolved that are specific to region and cellular state.

We have recently revealed critical\ntranscriptional programs downstream of CIC-DUX4 that drive malignant phenotypes, including tumor growth\nand metastasis. Additionally, recent studies demonstrate that Capicua (CIC) protein expression is directly\nmodulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathway. The long-term goal of our\nlaboratory is to identify and dissect the critical molecular pathways that regulate fusion oncoprotein stability and\nexpression in human sarcoma. Our studies will reveal fusion oncoprotein-specific vulnerabilities that can\nfacilitate precision-based therapeutic design to improve outcomes for patients with universally lethal forms of\nsarcomas. The objective of this proposal is to fuse our expertise in Capicua (CIC) biology and MAPK signaling\nto develop the first precision-based therapeutic approach for CIC-DUX4 sarcomas. We hypothesize, that\ngenetic or pharmacologic MAPK activation will lead to the degradation of the CIC-DUX4 oncoprotein. Our\nrationale is based on our prior studies demonstrating MAPK-mediated regulation of wild-type (non-fused) CIC\nprotein expression in the context of human cancer. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1)\nhuman ERK physically interacts with nuclear CIC-DUX4; (Aim 2) MAPK-ERK pathway activation decreases\nCIC-fused oncoprotein stability, leading to degradation; and (Aim 3) pharmacologic activation of the MAPK\npathway decreases tumor cell survival through rapid degradation of the CIC-DUX4 fusion oncoprotein. The\nsignificance of these findings are highly impactful, as there are no effective therapeutic strategies to target CIC-\nDUX4 sarcomas, which remain lethal in the metastatic setting. Our proposal is innovative because we are\nleveraging our expertise in MAPK-signaling, transcription factor fusions, and Capicua biology to develop a\nprecision-based therapeutic approach to directly target and degrade a lethal fusion oncoprotein in sarcoma, an\nunmet scientific and clinical need.

Here we will test whether radiation\n delivered in ultra-high dose rate (one-tenth of second), which far exceed the dose rate used in current clinical\n practice (minutes), can significantly reduce normal tissue toxicities associated with the radiotherapeutic\n management of childhood medulloblastoma (MB). The overarching goal is to alleviate the long term\n neurocognitive and cerebrovascular complications that compromise the quality of life of MB survivors while\n maintaining tumor control. To achieve these goals, we will undertake studies using clinically relevant FLASH\n and conventional radiation regimens. Two distinct human MB tumor models will be orthotopically implanted\n in the brain of nude mice to investigate simultaneously tumor response and neurocognitive function after\n irradiation. In addition, for long-term follow up, tumor-free mice will also be subjected to cranial irradiation\n using FLASH or conventional dose rate irradiation. Short-term (1-month) and longer term (4-6 months) studies\n conducted on tumor bearing and tumor free mice respectively, will critically evaluate tumor control,\n neurocognitive, cerebrovascular and molecular outcomes in these cohorts. Preclinical studies investigating the\n response of MB tumors, behavioral performance on multiple learning and memory tasks, vascular structure and\n integrity and the sparing of the neurogenic niche will unambiguously elucidate many of the mechanisms\n underlying the neuroprotective effects of FLASH radiotherapy. Data derived from these collaborative studies\n between UCI and the CHUV will facilitate the clinical translation of FLASH-RT to pediatric oncology, where\n despite the favorable prognosis of children diagnosed with MB, survivors still suffer a lifetime of complications\n caused by their prior radiotherapy, a scenario we hope to ameliorate with our innovative FLASH technology.

Prevention, therefore, remains the ultimate goal. An essential part of future preventive\nefforts will involve identifying children harboring preleukemic clones at birth. Several leukemia-initiating genetic\nlesions have been shown to arise prenatally; however, many other leukemia-initiating lesions have not been\nexamined at birth. Several critical questions remain to be answered: 1) What subtypes and what proportion of\nchildhood leukemia develops in utero? 2) What is the specific cell(s) of origin in which preleukemic clones arise?\nand 3) Are some newborns more prone to developing leukemia-initiating lesions than others? In this project, we\nwill answer these questions, with a focus on the ~70% of patients with known translocation or point mutation driver\nevents. This project has three main aims. Aim 1: To identify the presence and clonal frequency of prenatal\nleukemia-initiating lesions at birth. We will obtain matched cord blood (CB) and diagnostic leukemia samples from\n~250 childhood leukemia patients in the Children’s Oncology Group Project:Every Child study. Backtracking will\nfocus on ~182 patients with translocation/mutation-driven subtypes. We derive patient-specific somatic mutations\nfrom tumor profiling, then use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in flow-sorted CB cells to confirm the presence and\nfrequency of leukemia-initiating lesions at birth, and at different hematopoietic stages. We will also use ddPCR to\nbacktrack lesions in available newborn dried bloodspots (N ~45). Aim 2: To determine the cell of origin of leukemia-\ninitiating lesions, the transcriptomic changes from preleukemia to overt leukemia, and whether secondary\nmutations arise prenatally, across childhood leukemia subtypes. In 50 childhood leukemia patients where CB\nddPCR is positive we will conduct single-cell TARGET-seq on flow-sorted cell populations to simultaneously detect\nthe presence of each patient-specific leukemia-initiating events, secondary mutations, and gene expression in\ngenotypically- and immunophenotypically-defined populations at a single cell level. Aim 3: To determine whether\nthe presence and frequency of preleukemic clones correlate with known risk factors for leukemia. Demographic,\nperinatal, and genetic risk factors for childhood leukemia will be obtained through parental survey, birth records,\nand sequencing data. For overall ALL and AML, and for common subtypes, we will test for association between\nrisk factors and the presence and clonal frequency of preleukemic clones at birth, as measured in Aim 1. Identifying\na specific cell of origin of preleukemic genomic alterations, and their frequency in neonatal blood, will shed light on\nchildhood leukemia etiology and have important implications for precision prevention efforts. This study will identify\nkey steps required for leukemogenesis by directly comparing the genetic and transcriptomic architecture of\npreleukemic CB to the subsequent full-blown leukemia.

We demonstrated that unlike conventional T and CAR-T cells,\nV24-invariant natural killer T cells (NKTs) and CAR-NKTs effectively traffic to tumor sites in xenogeneic models\nof neuroblastoma (NB), which led to initiation of a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial evaluating autologous GD2-\nspecific CAR-NKTs in children with NB. Interim results from this trial have shown that the treatment is well-\ntolerated and produces antitumor activity, underscoring the need for systematic investigation of NKTs as an\nalternative cellular platform for CAR-redirected immunotherapy. We reported that repeated antigenic stimulation\nof NKTs and CAR-NKTs leads to their effector-like differentiation, exhaustion, and loss of antitumor activity. Our\npreliminary data demonstrate that Wnt signaling—specifically, activation of transcription factor LEF1—is required\nand sufficient for maintenance of the CD62L+ central memory-like NKT subset and is associated with NKT\nmetabolic and functional fitness. These findings provide rationale for examining the role and potential therapeutic\ntargeting of LEF1 in CAR-NKTs for cancer immunotherapy. Pre-clinical in vivo studies of CAR-NKTs have been\nlimited to xenogeneic models, which do not allow for evaluation of the full spectrum of downstream innate and\nadaptive immune responses. To address this gap, we have developed protocols to generate and expand highly\npure murine NKTs that express a murine CAR targeting the GD2 antigen expressed on human and murine NB\ncells. We have also adapted a syngeneic NB model that faithfully recapitulates the clinical and pathological\ncharacteristics of high-risk NB in children. We hypothesize that 1) LEF1 transcriptional activity is required for\nand can be therapeutically enhanced to maintain CAR-NKT cell metabolic fitness, in vivo persistence, and\ndurable antitumor activity; and 2) CAR-NKT antitumor activity depends on direct targeting of tumor cells, control\nof tumor-associated macrophages, transactivation of NK cells and induction of tumor-specific T cells. These\nhypotheses will be tested in the following specific aims: 1) to examine and therapeutically explore the\nmechanism responsible for maintenance of human central memory-like NKT and CAR-NKT cells, and 2) to\nexplore the mechanism by which CAR-NKTs mediate antitumor activity in a syngeneic NB model. We will use\ngenetic loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches to study the role of LEF1 in CAR-NKT functional\ndifferentiation, metabolism, and antitumor activity using in vitro experimental systems with human cells and in\nvivo xenogeneic NB models in mice. To study the mechanism by which CAR-NKTs mediate antitumor activity in\nthe syngeneic setting, we will perform a side-by-side comparison of murine NKTs and T cells expressing a GD2-\nspecifc CAR. The proposed experiments will mechanistically dissect the contributions of the native NKT cell\nTCR, the tumor-specific CAR, and therapy-induced innate and adaptive immune responses. The results will\ninform development of next-generation CAR-NKT immunotherapy for NB and other types of cancer.

project	1R15CA263868-01	R15CA263868	10290439	2021	Determining the significance of the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction in neuroblastoma.	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nNeuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor found in infants, with almost all cases\nbeing diagnosed by the age of five. The most severe cases of neuroblastoma are linked to amplification of\nthe N-MYC oncogene, which occurs in ~20% of all NB. N-MYC amplification is associated with ~50%\noverall survival despite aggressive multimodal therapies, highlighting the need for new targeted therapies to\ncombat this pediatric cancer. N-MYC, like any MYC protein, must be able to recognize and bind chromatin\nin order to activate its oncogenic potential. This project is built on the premise that an essential co-factor for\nMYC proteins called WDR5 acts to recruit N-MYC to chromatin at genes that work to maintain\nneuroblastoma function, and that targeting the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction can serve as a focal point for anti-\nN-MYC based therapies. Support for this hypothesis comes from published data showing that WDR5 is a\nconserved regulator of protein synthesis genes across multiple cellular contexts where WDR5 binds and\nregulates these loci through its so-called “WIN”-site. In addition, the MYC family member, c-MYC, requires\nWDR5 to bind genes associated with biomass accumulation and translation, and the c-MYC-WDR5\ninteraction is essential for tumor maintenance in lymphoma mouse models. In an N-MYC amplified NB cell\nline, preliminary data reveal that targeting the WIN-site of WDR5 using small molecule inhibitors results in a\ngenome-wide decrease in WDR5 binding, with a subsequent loss of N-MYC binding at specific N-MYC-\nWDR5 co-bound genes. And, importantly, disrupting the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction using genetic mutants\nimpairs the ability of N-MYC to drive anchorage-independent growth, providing evidence that there are\nessential tumor functions tied to N-MYC that require interaction with WDR5. Together these data provide a\nsolid foundation for the notion that N-MYC requires WDR5 to bind and regulate N-MYC-WDR5 co-bound\ngenes that are important for driving N-MYC specific activities. The goal of this project is to interrogate the N-\nMYC-WDR5 interaction in N-MYC amplified neuroblastoma cell lines and determine the influence that\nWDR5 has on N-MYC driven transcriptional processes and neuroblastoma function using genetic and\nchemical perturbations. Specific Aim 1 will employ genetic and genomic approaches to identify the genes\nthat are bound by N-MYC and WDR5, and determine at which genes the recruitment of N-MYC is\ndependent on the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction. Specific Aim 2 will combine high-resolution transcriptomic\nanalyses with cellular and in vivo functional assays to challenge the significance of the N-MYC-WDR5\ninteraction. At the completion of these studies we will have identified the precise genes in which N-MYC\nbinding and transcription is regulated by the N-MYC-WDR5 interaction, and have directly challenged the\nsignificance of the N-MYC-WDR5 interactions on multiple facets of NB tumorigenesis.

project	2U01CA199221-07	U01CA199221	10299853	2021	Genomically informed agent selection and testing in osteosarcoma patient-derived xenograft models	Grant	Project Summary/ Abstract\nSurvival outcomes for patients with osteosarcoma have not changed since the advent of modern chemotherapy\nfour decades ago and it has been challenging to develop new effective therapies in this disease. Our lab’s long-\nterm mission is to identify novel molecular targets in osteosarcoma via comprehensive genomic and proteomic\nprofiling of patient-derived cell lines and xenografts as well as human tumors with the ultimate goal of identifying\nand/or developing and testing therapeutics against these targets. To achieve this goal, we have a) built a robust\nprofiling platform to identify novel targets; b) expanded our repertoire of osteosarcoma patient derived xenograft\n(PDX) models to reflect disease heterogeneity; and c) conducted high-throughput in vivo testing of 8-10 new\nagents each year both as part of Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) as well as independent of it.\nAll of these efforts form the basis of our current research proposal and place us strongly poised to successfully\nachieve our goals.\nOur overall objective is to efficiently evaluate the efficacy of new agents with high potential to have activity in\nosteosarcoma based on target data from our genomic and proteomic profiling both as single agents and in\nrational combinations, with the vision of moving effective agents into clinical trials through the Children’s\nOncology Group. We have three specific aims- 1) to select and test agents in vivo against surface targets\nidentified by comprehensive proteomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts and patient tumors; 2) to select and\ntest agents in vivo against targets identified by comprehensive genomic profiling of osteosarcoma xenografts\nand patient tumors; and 3) to perform testing of rationally combined agents based on target, toxicity and efficacy\ndata of single agents.\nAgents from the PPTC pipeline will be selected based on either the proteomic target or genomic alteration being\npresent in at least a subset of available osteosarcoma PDX models. The agent will be tested in selected cohorts\nof low/ high expressing protein target or present/ absent genomic alteration. In cases with multiple models with\ntarget expression, 3-5 mice per model will be used and in cases with few models available, 8-10 mice per model\nwill be used for control and experiment groups with an overall n per arm per experiment of approximately 30\nmice. Standard PPTC procedures will be used for tumor implantation and treatment. Tumor dimensions will be\nmeasured twice a week and response quantified as per standard PPTC definitions of complete response,\nmaintained complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease. For combination\nstudies, three potential types of combinations will be considered based on efficacy and toxicity data- a) two\nsurface protein targeted agents such as two antibody-drug conjugates; 2) two molecularly targeted agents and\n3) a surface protein targeted agent and a molecularly targeted agent. Our results will guide the development of\nthe next generation of clinical trials in osteosarcoma.

Consequently, the number of patients that can be enrolled in phase I/II clinical trials is small, and most\npatients will have been extensively treated, hence drug/radiation resistant. Thus, preclinical studies that\naccurately translate into effective clinical therapy are an essential component of pediatric drug development. Our\ngroup has contributed to studies in the PPTP/C that have led to clinical studies through Children's Oncology\nGroup (COG). Of importance, we have developed and characterized over 330 Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX),\ndeveloped from tumors both at diagnosis and relapse, that can be used to facilitate pediatric drug development\nas directed by FDA under the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity for Children Act (RACE for Children\nAct). Based on our studies, both in and outside the PPTC, we propose to use PDX/CDX models of sarcoma,\nkidney cancer, and hepatoblastoma derived from high-risk patients to identify novel agents and combinations,\nand to test at least 8-10 agents per year, for which we have expertise. We will explore specific hypotheses to\nintegrate molecular-targeted agents with conventional chemo-radiation treatment, advanced drug delivery\nsystems (antibody-drug conjugates, nanoparticles), and the use of Single Mouse Testing (SMT) as the primary\nscreening approach. In collaborative studies, we will evaluate a new humanized mouse model where testing of\nimmuno-oncology agents is a priority to treat these PDX models. One of the objective limitations of PPTP/C\ntesting was that relatively few tumor models representing a specific disease (n=3-8/disease) could be used within\nthe resource constraints, a number clearly insufficient to recapitulate the genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity of\neach clinical disease. Our retrospective analysis of PPTP data, and recent prospective testing in the PPTC,\nshows that a single mouse/tumor line gives essentially similar data to conventional testing' (using 10 mice/group\nfor each tumor line). The advantage of the SMT design is that it allows for incorporation of up to 20-fold more\nmodels, more accurately representing the genetic/epigenetic diversity of each pediatric cancer within the same\nresource constraints. The proposed studies will adopt SMT as the primary screening approach to identify agents\nthat have biologically meaningful activity (i.e. large antitumor effects) and identify tumors that are `exceptional\nresponders' for validation. The SMT approach, when linked to the molecular characterization of PDX models,\npotentially increases the power to identify biomarkers associated with response. Using SMT we can essentially\nconduct preclinical phase II trials and simulate the likely clinical response rate more accurately for a given\ndisease. As part of the Ped-In Vivo-TP, we aim to develop highly effective, less toxic therapies for high-risk\ncancers that afflict children and adolescents/young adults (AYA).

Grant	PBTC Project Summary/Abstract\nThe primary goal of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) is to rapidly and effectively\ncontribute to the understanding and cure of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors\nthrough innovative, multidisciplinary and multi-institutional prospective clinical trials. PBTC clinical\ntrial development is not only based upon known prognostic factors but also upon an evolving\nunderstanding of pediatric brain tumor biology. The PBTC will continue to utilize innovative study\ndesigns and analyses based on state-of-the-art statistical science. Novel clinical trials will\nincorporate relevant correlative pharmacology, biology, neuroimaging, immunologic and\ngenomics studies in an effort to define and integrate these modalities into a better understanding\nof pediatric CNS tumors. These goals will be accomplished through a close and continued\npartnership with the member institutions' basic and translational scientists as well as the clinical\ntrial experts. In addition, the PBTC welcomes partnerships with investigators outside the\nconsortium providing scientific, laboratory and regulatory support for innovative and high priority\nclinical trials. The PBTC will continue to maintain and grow its relationship with the National\nCancer Institute (NCI) and its large network of adult and pediatric groups as well as with\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. One of the most important goals of the PBTC is to\nsuccessfully complete focused phase I and II clinical trials of novel agents and treatment\napproaches that can be then be translated into large prospective phase II and III studies overseen\nby the Children's Oncology Group (COG). The overarching long-term goal is to improve survival\noutcome and quality of life for children with CNS tumor diagnoses that so often lead to high\nmorbidity and mortality such as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, high-grade gliomas, infant\nembryonal tumors, refractory medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and low-grade gliomas. To this\nend, the PBTC will continue to focus upon introducing novel molecularly-targeted agents via\ninnovative trials to assess the presence of the target in tumor and surrogate tissue, evaluate the\nability of the agent to down-regulate its signaling target and better correlate pharmacokinetic and\npharmacodynamic endpoints with toxicities and clinical responses. The PBTC will also continue\nto explore therapeutic opportunities for pediatric brain tumors through immunotherapeutic\ninterventions as well as via local delivery of treatments. By focusing on the most common solid\ntumor in children which also accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths in\npediatrics, the PBTC will continue to support the NCI's mission of helping all people live longer,\nhealthier lives through its contributions to cancer research and identification of better treatments.

The overall 5-year survival rate for childhood cancers,\nmany of which were uniformly fatal in the pre-chemotherapy era, is now 84%. Progress for a number of childhood\ncancers, however, has been limited, with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50%\nof children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing\nto their disease. In the US, cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease in children greater than one\nyear of age. Moreover, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage,\nhormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the\nestimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health related quality of life\ncomplication from childhood cancer and its treatment. Thus, despite our advances, development of new\ntherapeutic approaches must be a priority for childhood cancer basic, translational and clinical researchers. The\nChildren’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and\nadolescent cancer research, was founded 17 years ago. The COG’s multidisciplinary research team, comprised\nof more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and\ncancer centers. This proposal is for COG, as part of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) National Clinical Trials\nNetwork (NCTN), to continue its collaborative research work that supports the mission of improving the outcome\nfor all children with cancer. The COG will design and conduct clinical-translational studies for children with cancer\nthat builds on an increasing understanding of the molecular basis for pediatric malignancies and has the highest\npotential to improve the outcome. Using innovative clinical trial designs suitable for the study of rare diseases,\nwe will study novel therapeutic approaches including but not limited to targeted small molecule drugs,\nimmunotherapies and cellular therapies. The COG research portfolio importantly also includes clinical trials\nfocused on improving the quality of life children with cancer and survivors. As more than 90% of children\ndiagnosed with cancer in the US are treated at COG member institutions, the COG has the ability to offer a\ndiverse population of children with cancer and their families the opportunity to participate in innovative research.\nThis research effort includes allowing for collection and annotation of biospecimens from all children with cancer,\nproviding the foundation for discovery and accelerating the most promising research efforts conducted in\nlaboratories around the world.

Since each colon cancer has its own unique features,\nit is very important to obtain personalized cancer treatments and ﬁnd a way to tailor treatment strategies for\neach patient based on each individual's characteristics, including race, gender, genetic factors, immune response\nvariations.\n Recently, Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP) has been commonly used to discover, validate,\nand test drugs. QSP models are a system of differential equations that model the dynamic interactions between\ndrug(s) and a biological system. These mathematical models provide an integrated “systems level” approach to\ndetermining mechanisms of action of drugs and ﬁnding new ways to alter complex cellular networks with mono\nor combination therapy to obtain effective treatments. Since QSP models are a complex system of nonlinear\nequations with many unknown parameters, estimating the values of the model's parameters is extremely difﬁcult.\nExisting parameter estimation methods for QSP models often use assembled data from various sources rather\nthan a single curated dataset. These datasets are usually obtained through various biological experiments, in\nvitro and in vivo animal studies, thus rendering QSP models hard to be practicable for personalized treatments.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no QSP model has been developed for personalized colon cancer treatments.\n In this project, we propose a unique approach to develop a data-driven QSP software to suggest effective\ntreatment for each patient based on gene expression data from the primary tumor samples. Since signatures of\nmain characteristics of tumors, such as immune response variations, can be found in gene expression proﬁling\nof primary tumors, we use gene expression data as input. We develop an innovative framework to systematically\nemploy a combination of data science, mathematical, and statistical methods to obtain personalized colon cancer\ntreatment. We employ novel inverse problem techniques to estimate the values of parameters of the model and\nstatistical methods to perform sensitivity analysis. We will use these techniques to propose an optimal treatment\nstrategy for each patient and predict the efﬁcacy of the proposed treatment. The model might also suggest\nalternative therapies in case of low efﬁcacy for some patients.

project	1R01CA262887-01	R01CA262887	10279241	2021	Image-guided combination therapies for radiotherapy-induced neurocognitive impairment in pediatric brain tumor survivors	Grant	Approximately 90% of pediatric central nervous system tumor (CNST) survivors, treated with radiotherapy,\nexperience radiotherapy-induced brain injury (RIBI) and neurocognitive decline later in life. This is a progressive\ntreatment-related side effect, which impacts the quality of life of pediatric CNST survivors. Since more pediatric\npatients are surviving cancer, there is a growing need for RIBI prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Chronic\noxidative stress and neuroinflammation are key contributors to RIBI. Thus, neuroprotective strategies to reduce\noxidative stress and neuroinflammation are being explored. Neuroengineering strategies using regenerative\nstem cells to repair RIBI are also being explored. However, prolonging the survival of transplanted stem cells at\ninjury sites is a challenge, partly due to chronic oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Accordingly, strategies\nto improve transplanted stem cell survival are on the horizon. For these strategies to be effective, drug delivery\nsystems capable of effectively delivering neuroprotective drugs to brain injuries are greatly needed. Also critical\nfor clinical translation efforts are methods to noninvasively image drug delivery and tissue responses to therapy.\nNanotechnology in combination with image-guided neuro-interventional procedures are promising for drug\ndelivery. In addition, diamagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (CEST\nMRI) is a promising MRI technique that can be used to noninvasively and directly image organic drugs. Although,\nCEST MRI is based on a magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) technique, it is more sensitive (~1000 times)\nthan MRS. Furthermore, given the inherent correlation between CEST MRI signals, pH, and oxidative stress, it\ncan also be used to image changes in tissue oxidative stress, in response to effective drug delivery. We propose\nto develop CEST MRI theranostic biosensors and complementary CEST MRI nanotheranostic agents for image-\nguided combination therapy of RIBI. In Aim 1, neuroprotective drugs will be screened by CEST MRI, and each\ndrug’s potential to serve as a pH-dependent CEST MRI theranostic biosensor will be evaluated in our preclinical\nRIBI model. The feasibility of imaging changes in tissue oxidative stress in vivo with the CEST MRI theranostic\nagents will also be evaluated. In Aim 2, we will develop oxidative stress-activable CEST MRI nanotheranostic\nbiosensors and evaluate each agent’s potential to sustainably reduce oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in\nour RIBI model. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the feasibility of improving transplanted stem cell survival and\nneurorepair in our RIBI model, by sustainably reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Stem cell\nsurvival will be imaged with our stem cell tracking MRI biosensor, capable of noninvasively imaging stem cell\ndelivery, migration and survival. All results will be validated with multi-parametric MRI; PET imaging of\nneuroinflammation, using the translocator protein radiotracer [(11)C]DPA-713; behavioral tests of memory and\nlearning; histology and immunohistochemistry. This project will advance the development of neuroprotective and\nneuroengineering strategies for RIBI in pediatric CNS survivors, ultimately improving their quality of life.

project	1R01CA263500-01	R01CA263500	10279921	2021	Developing Safe and Effective GD2-CAR T Cell Therapy for Diffuse Midline Gliomas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nBrain tumors are the leading cause of cancer related death in children; among these, diffuse intrinsic pontine\nglioma (DIPG) and other histone-3 K27M (H3K27M) mutated diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are the most\naggressive and are universally fatal with current standard therapies. Despite several decades of investigational\ntrials testing dozens of therapeutic approaches, median overall survival for DIPG is 11 months. Chimeric antigen\nreceptor (CAR)-expressing T-cells have mediated impressive clinical activity in B-cell malignancies, and recent\npreclinical and early clinical results suggest benefit in CNS malignancies. We discovered homogenous, high\noverexpression of the GD2 ganglioside on H3K27M DMGs and demonstrated impressive antitumor effects in\nxenograft models of H3K27M-mutant DIPG following treatment with GD2-CAR T cells (GD2-CART, Mount, Nat\nMed 2018). Significant clinical experience with GD2 targeting CAR T cells, available mostly from studies in\nneuroblastoma, demonstrate safety and some early signals of antitumor activity. Safe and effective translation\nof these findings to children with DMGs would transform the landscape for this universally lethal pediatric brain\ntumor. This bench-to-bedside-to-bench project will conduct three aims in parallel leveraging a recently launched\nsingle institution Phase I trial of GD2.BB.z.iCasp9-CAR T cells administered intravenously following a\nlymphodepleting preparative regimen in children and young adults with H3K27M DMGs. The first aim focuses\non safety, integrating insights gleaned in our preclinical models into trial design to diminish the risk of tumor\ninflammation associated neurotoxicity (TIAN), to establish best practices and to develop improved grading and\ntreatment algorithms for this novel toxicity. The second aim focuses on efficacy, assessing clinical activity of\nGD2-CART in DMG and identifying biomarkers and clinical features associated with response. We further\naddress the limitations of standard radiographic imaging in these infiltrative tumors using a novel machine\nlearning aided MRI radiomics approach to quantify textural changes within the tumor and assess whether such\nchanges correlate with clinical outcome, and we assess whether GD2-CART induced changes in CSF cell free\nDNA can provide a rapid quantitative assessment of antitumor response. Our third aim is a discovery aim,\nfocused on improving understanding of the biology associated with myeloid cell activation following GD2-CART\ntherapy for DMGs, which we observe in preclinical models and we observed in the first patient treated. Here we\nundertake comprehensive single cell profiling of CSF myeloid cells emerging post-GD2-CART in patients\nenrolled on the study and in preclinical models, and bedside-to-bench translation using murine models to test\nthe hypotheses that GD2-CART induced CNS myeloid cell expansion/activation limit the efficacy of GD2-CART,\nare modulated by corticosteroid therapy and that this obstacle can be overcome by engineering CD47\noverexpression in the GD2-CART.

Unfortunately, many survivors now live with life-long side\neffects from treatment itself. Radiation therapy, used for brain tumors, is particularly damaging. The most\nserious side effect is necrosis which can result in weakness, paralysis or even death. Proton therapy is an\nincreasingly popular radiation modality. Proton therapy reduces exposure to normal tissues and the reby\nmay decrease the incidence of cognitive deficits following radiation. However, recent studies, including our\nown suggest that certain areas of proton beams may be more damaging to brain tissue than others\npotentially leading to higher rates of necrosis. Here we will develop high accuracy models to correlate\nnecrosis with the physical parameters of proton beams. These models will include multi-cell type human\nbrain “organoids” as well as rodent animal models. Using these models as well as clinical data, we will\nidentify the physical factors of proton therapy which may lead to necrosis. This is significant in that this data\nmay be used to design safer proton therapy treatments in which the most biologically effective portions of\nbeams are solely placed within the tumor. This should reduce necrosis and improve disease control. In a\nsecond component of our study, we will examine the molecular mechanisms of necrosis. Rather than being\nsimple dis-organized death, we will determine if radiation induces an orderly programmed cell death\npathway. We will conduct the following aims; (1) relate the physical factors of proton beams with biological\nresponse, (2) explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms of radiation induced brain damage and (3)\nvalidate the clinical consequences of variability in the effectiveness of proton beams. The knowledge gained\nwill quickly influence the treatment of brain tumor patients and expedite the clinical introduction of agents\nand approaches to combat the negative effects of radiation on the brain.	3-Dimensional;Adult;Adverse effects;Animal Model;Animals;Apoptosis;Area;Biological;Biological Factors;Biological Markers;Brain;Brain Injuries;Brain Neoplasms;Cancerous;Cell Death;Cells;Cerebrum;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Childhood;Childhood Ependymoma;Clinical;Clinical Data;Coculture Techniques;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Cranial Irradiation;Data;Dependence;Disease model;Distal;Dose;Educational workshop;Effectiveness;Engineering;Exposure to;Glioma;Human;Image;In Vitro;Incidence;Inflammatory;Intensity modulated proton therapy;Intervention;Knowledge;Laboratories;Laboratory Study;Lead;Life;Linear Energy Transfer;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Mission;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;National Cancer Institute;Necrosis;Necrosis Induction;Normal tissue morphology;Organoids;Outcome;Paralysed;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Photons;Planning Techniques;Preparation;Prevention;Process;Protons;Public Health;Radiation;Radiation Injuries;Radiation necrosis;Radiation therapy;Relative Biological Effectiveness;Research;Research Support;Rodent;Roentgen Rays;Role;Scanning;Signal Transduction;Survivors;Techniques;Tissues;Transgenic Animals;Treatment Side Effects;Uncertainty;brain cell;brain tissue;cancer cell;cancer rehabilitation;cancer therapy;cell injury;cell type;clinical investigation;clinical practice;clinically relevant;combat;design;disorder control;high risk;imaging platform;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;induced pluripotent stem cell;insight;irradiation;medulloblastoma;novel;pediatric patients;pre-clinical;predictive modeling;proton beam;proton therapy;radiation effect;radiation response;radiation risk;response;side effect;treatment planning;treatment response;tumor	UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR	HOUSTON	TX	UNITED STATES	DAVID R GROSSHANS	DCTD	Pat G Prasanna	174886	<$250k	174886	2-Aug-2021	2-Aug-2021	31-Jul-2026	PAR-19-325	CCDI
project	1U01CA263969-01	U01CA263969	10300360	2021	In Vivo Testing of Novel Drug Combinations for Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcomas	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nDespite the advances made in our understanding of the etiology of pediatric soft tissue sarcomas\n(STS), the overall survival of those diseases has not significantly improved in over 2 decades. For\nchildren with recurrent disease, survival is below 30%, and long-term survivors have an increased\nburden of disease associated with the curative therapies they received. Therefore, the goal of our\nresearch team is to improve the survival and quality of life of children with STS by integrating basic,\ntranslational, and clinical research. For the past 10 years, we have consented STS and other solid\ntumor patients to donate tissue for orthotopic implantation into immunocompromised mice to develop\northotopic patient derived xenografts (O-PDXs). Our O-PDXs have been used for ex vivo high-\nthroughput drug screening and in vivo testing using a standardized preclinical phase I, II, III paradigm.\nRhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common STS in children and genomic studies have shown that\nrare subsets of clonally related cells can survive treatment and contribute to disease recurrence.\nSubsequent integrated analyses using transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic data showed that RMS\ntumors retain lineage-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of their developmental origins.\nMore recently, single cell and single nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) and in vivo lineage-tracing\nshowed that clones of cells can transition through their normal developmental programs. Indeed, single-\ncell ATAC-seq demonstrated that the cell- and developmental stage–specific super-enhancer activity is\ncorrelated with those clonal changes in gene expression. Chemotherapy eliminates the most\nproliferative tumor cell populations, and the surviving dormant tumor cells rapidly expand and re-\nestablish their developmental hierarchy, which leads to disease recurrence. This is a striking example\nof the complex cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic signaling within STS and the intricate connection between\ndevelopmental and oncogenic pathways in childhood cancer. In this proposal, we will perform in vivo\ntesting for 8-10 drugs per year using our STS O-PDX models. The most compelling pathways are\ndevelopmental kinase pathways (Aim 1), cell stress pathways (Aim 2) and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints\n(Aim 3). Novel drug combinations will be tested as well as those that include conventional\nchemotherapy for standard of care. Particular emphasis will be placed on eliminating all the clones in\nthe tumor to improve survival by reducing disease recurrence.

This proposal describes a five-year plan to facilitate her transition to independence\nthrough the acquisition of critical technical skills and scientific training in brain tumor modeling and evaluation\nof the tumor microenvironment with single cell RNA sequencing, integrated with comprehensive mentoring\nfrom a diverse team of faculty members. She will conduct the proposed studies under the proven mentorship of\nDr. John Maris, an international leader in translational neuroblastoma research and immunogenomics.\nAdditionally, her dedicated Advisory Committee is comprised of highly regarded physician-scientists with\ndiverse expertise in immunotherapy and pediatric brain tumors. Finally, the collaborative research environment\nwith unparalleled resources at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia\nprovides an ideal setting to conduct these translational studies.\nDiffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a devastating pediatric brain tumor that remains incurable despite\ndecades of clinical trials, with a median survival of 11 months. This proposal seeks to use chimeric antigen\nreceptor (CAR) T cell therapy, a form of immunotherapy, to target DIPG. Recently GD2 was identified as an\nimmunotherapeutic target for DIPG, and lentiviral GD2-directed CAR T cells were able to successfully treat\nmurine models of DIPG. However, a significant number of mice treated with CAR T cells died due to\ninflammation and herniation, prompting concerns for potential toxicity from this therapy, in particular in the\npons. This proposal is building upon the applicant's experience utilizing mRNA for the creation of CAR T cells\nthat are transient and can be titrated to effect to avoid toxicity, here using repeated local delivery of GD2-\ndirected mRNA CAR T cells to effectively treat DIPG while still maintaining safety. Aim 1 will determine the\neffect of GD2-directed mRNA CAR T cells on tumor, microenvironment and normal tissue using both\nimmunocompetent and xenograft models of DIPG.

Conventional CD4, or `helper', T cells play an integral role in\norchestrating immune responses, and can potentiate the function of antitumor immunity: both via activation and\npotentiation of antigen presenting cell function and antitumor CD8 T cells. My postdoctoral work demonstrated\nthat reactivating childhood vaccine-specific CD4 T cells after intratumor injection of recall antigen (e.g. polio\ncapsid or tetanus toxoid), mediates antitumor efficacy and causes both innate and adaptive inflammation within\ntumors. The antitumor efficacy of intratumor recall responses were partially dependent upon CD8 T cells, and\ncoincided with infiltration of activated granulocytic macrophages with phenotypes distinct from tumor associated\nmacrophages after direct innate stimulation with Poly IC. Thus, inducing CD4 T cell recall represents a novel\ntherapeutic opportunity, with a distinct mode of inflammatory and antitumor potential. We hypothesize that\nintratumor childhood vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell recall responses instigate distinct and durable inflammatory\nreprograming of myeloid cells to potentiate antitumor CD8+ T cell function and mediate antitumor efficacy. To\ntest this hypothesis, we will define reprogramming of innate immunity after triggering intratumor recall responses\nand determine its role in mediating antitumor efficacy (Aim 1) and test if polio vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell recall\nresponses `help' antitumor CD8+ T cells (Aim 2). These analyses will inform clinically actionable routes to develop\nrecall antigen-based therapies that enlist CD4 T cell help within tumors (the goal of the independent, R00 phase).\nThe clinical translation of these findings will be informed by identifying therapeutic strategies, such as combined\ninnate pattern recognition receptor agonist therapy, that may synergize with recall antigens in mediating systemic\nantitumor efficacy; as well as identifying more targeted molecular routes to recapitulate CD4 T cell help in tumors\ntherapeutically (Aim 3). The K99 phase of this work will be mentored by several distinguished experts in tumor\nimmunobiology and cancer immunotherapy: including Drs. Darell Bigner (primary Mentor, cancer immunotherapy\nof brain tumors), Simon Gregory (computational expert), Qi Jing-Li (T cell biologist using transcriptome analyses\nto gauge T cell function), Amy Heimberger (tumor associated myeloid cell expert who has previously applied\ntranscriptome analyses to define activation/suppressive features of tumor associated myeloid cells), and James\nHerndon II (biostatistical support). This proposal will enable clinical translation of recall antigens to cancer\npatients and will seed a research program that leverages the potent immune-stimulating effects of CD4+ T cell\nhelp to develop novel cancer therapies.

Two\ntargets have been considered for Diffuse Midline Glioma H3 K27M-mutant tumors (previously Diffuse Intrinsic\nPontine Glioma (DIPG)), however as neither are exclusively restricted to neoplastic tissue, safety concerns\nexist with respect to on-target, off-tumor toxicity. Moreover, ancillary treatment meant to boost CAR T function\nto overcome a constellation of immune suppressive mechanisms associated with the solid tumor\nmicroenvironment also has the potential to exacerbate the problem. Our group has conducted extensive\npreclinical characterization of oncolytic viruses and has demonstrated them to be a highly effective\nimmunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. We propose to leverage the tumor tropism of ∆24\noncolytic adenovirus to deliver a CAR target along with CD40L. Our preliminary data indicates that oncolytic\nAd∆24-CD40L provides a significant therapeutic advantage in a GL261 glioma model as a monotherapy, and\nfurther, can potentiate CD19 CAR T therapy in a proof of concept combination setting against subcutaneous\nB16-CD19 tumors. The goal of this proposal is to develop a dual therapy approach which builds on direct\ntumor cell viral oncolysis and CAR T cytolysis, enhanced CAR T cell recruitment/activation by virus-mediated\ninflammation, and importantly, CD40L-mediated mobilization of endogenous antigen presenting cells, B cells\nand T cells. We will engineer an oncolytic vector to deliver titratable levels of CD40L using the E. coli DHFR\ndestabilizing domain, and an intracellularly truncated signaling-dead EGFRvIII molecule to be used in\nconjunction with safety tested EGFRvIII CAR T cells (Aim1). The safety and efficacy of the OV-CAR T\napproach will be evaluated in a genetically engineered immunocompetent model of DIPG (Aim 2). This project\nis expected to provide novel insight into how CD40L can mobilize an endogenous B cell and T cell response\nand support CAR T therapy. Together, we hope to capitalize on the properties of designer oncolytic viruses to\nmore broadly enable the use of CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors, and in particular apply existing safety\ntested immunotherapies to a devastating and urgent unmet clinical need.

Recent US\nGovernment legislation, combined with the relative rarity and higher cure rates of childhood cancer\ncompared with adults, emphasize the importance of new agent preclinical testing programs aimed at\nmaximizing the likelihood that only the most active drugs will be advanced into early phase clinical trials.\nThe broad aim of this application is to improve the treatment options for children with aggressive and/or\ndrug resistant ALL by prioritizing new drugs for clinical trials in the disease using state-of-the-art\npreclinical experimental models. This aim will be accomplished using a large panel of 90 pediatric ALL\npatient-derived xenografts (PDXs) that have undergone a high level of cell and molecular\ncharacterization and authentication.\n The PDXs to be used in this study were all established as models of orthotopic disease in immune-\ndeficient (NOD/SCID or NSG) mice from direct patient explants without prior ex vivo culture. The PDXs\ndevelop as systemic disease in NSG mice and infiltrate the same major organs in mice as the primary\ndisease in human patients. Engraftment and responses to treatment are monitored by measuring the\nproportion of human leukemia cells in the peripheral blood of mice on a weekly basis, which provides a\nreliable representation of overall leukemia burden in the animals. Where luciferase-expressing PDXs\nare available, this testing will be augmented by bioluminescence imaging of animals.\n The broad methodology will involve inoculation of PDX cells into NSG mice, a lag time to allow the\ndisease to establish, followed by drug treatment and monitoring to assess drug responses. Methods of\nresponse evaluation have been developed using stringent criteria modeled after the clinical setting, in\norder to minimize the likelihood of over-predicting drug responses in mice leading to failure of drugs in\nthe clinic. The proposed drug testing will adopt multiple formats, including conventional drug testing (6-\n10 mice/group), single-mouse trial testing (1 PDX x 1 mouse x 1 drug) and testing of new agents in\ncombination with standard-of-care drugs. In this fashion, this Research Program aims to test 8-10 new\nagents per year.\n By completing the major objectives outlined in this proposal, the long term health benefit aims to\nimprove the treatment options and quality of life for children with aggressive forms of ALL who would\notherwise succumb to their disease.

project	1R01CA255643-01A1	R01CA255643	10298611	2021	Leveraging Tumor Suppressor Inactivation for Osteosarcoma Therapy	Grant	PROJECT SUMMARY\nOsteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor, found in the pediatric\npopulation and often leads to death due to tumor progression and metastasis. Despite\nintensive, multimodality treatment protocols with cytotoxic chemotherapy and aggressive\nsurgery, 30-40% of patients still succumb to relapsed and metastatic disease. Current\ntreatment options for these patients are extremely limited. More importantly, the clinical\noutcome for OS patients has not improved at all during the last four decades. Our long-range\ngoals are to reduce OS disease burden and improve long-term survival by developing\nmolecular-based therapies that target mechanisms of tumor growth and metastasis. The F-box\nprotein s-phase kinase-associated protein-2 (Skp2) is the substrate recognition component of\nthe Skp1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) complex and considered a key oncogene through its ability to\ntarget cell cycle regulators for ubiquitin degradation, regulates cell migration and metastasis.\nSkp2 interacts with the accessory protein Cks1 to ubiquitinate p27 for degradation, thus\npromoting cell cycle progression and cancer growth. Currently, the oncogenic mechanisms\nand therapeutic potential of Skp2 in OS is largely unknown. There are specific and rational\nreasons for targeting the SCF-Skp2 axis in OS, based upon preliminary data generated by the\nPI and his colleagues: (1) A high Skp2 expression in OS tissues portends a poor prognosis in\npatients; (2) High levels of Skp2 are observed in many OS cell types, including established cell\nlines, patient-derived xenografts, and primary cultures from OS patients; (3) Skp2 deletion\neffectively blocks pituitary and prostate tumorigenesis in Rb1/p53-deficient mouse models. In\nOS, genomic sequencing studies reveal a high rate of Rb1/p53 co-inactivation, suggesting that\nOS may be susceptible to Skp2 blockade; (4) Genetic and drug-induced depletion of Skp2\nreduces the proliferation and invasion of OS cell lines and; (5) Mouse embryonic fibroblasts\n(MEF) and OS tumor cells with Rb1/p53 deletion are more sensitive to SCF-Skp2 inhibition\nthan wild-type and Skp2-deleted cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the SCF-Skp2\ncomplex may offer a unique therapeutic opportunity for treating a tremendously challenging\ncancer such as OS. We hypothesize that blockade of the SCF-Skp2 complex in the context of\nRb1/p53 inactivation will reduce OS progression. This hypothesis will be addressed by the\nfollowing specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (Oncogenic Mechanisms): To define the pro-oncogenic\nmechanisms of SCF-Skp2 in Rb1/p53-inactivated OS. Specific Aim 2 (Translational\nTherapeutics): To determine the effect of inhibiting SCF-Skp2 in preclinical models of Rb1/p53-\ninactivated OS. Finally, since cancer organoids represent an emerging technology that\nfaithfully replicates the tumor's genetic landscape, we will examine the effect of inhibiting SCF-\nSkp2 in mouse OS organoids as a proof-of-concept to translate findings into patient-specific\ntherapeutics in the future. The successful completion of this study will be translatable to target\nthe SCF-Skp2 complex to block osteosarcoma progression.\n	Address;Alanine;Amputation;Animals;Apoptosis;Cell Cycle;Cell Cycle Progression;Cell Line;Cells;Cessation of life;Childhood;Clinical;Combined Modality Therapy;Complex;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Data;Defect;Disease;Dose-Limiting;Embryo;Emerging Technologies;F Box Domain;F-Box Proteins;Fibroblasts;Future;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genomics;Goals;Growth;Histologic;Immunoblotting;Implant;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Malignant Bone Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pituitary gland;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Mediating;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Lung;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organoids;Osteoblasts;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Pituitary Gland;Play;Population;Positioning Attribute;Pre-Clinical Model;Prognosis;Proteins;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;Randomized;Relapse;Role;Skp2 Proteins;Survival Rate;TP53 gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Threonine;Tissues;Translating;Treatment Protocols;Treatment-related toxicity;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;base;burden of illness;cell motility;cell type;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B;established cell line;immunoregulation;implantation;improved;innovation;insight;mouse model;multicatalytic endopeptidase complex;neoplastic cell;next generation sequencing;novel;novel therapeutics;osteosarcoma;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;prostate carcinogenesis;screening;side effect;stemness;targeted treatment;transcriptome;transcriptomics;translational impact;treatment effect;treatment group;tumor;tumor growth;tumor progression;tumorigenesis	ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE	BRONX	NY	UNITED STATES	BANG H HOANG	DCTD	Sudhir B Kondapaka	420442	$250k to $499k	420442	21-Jun-2021	1-Jul-2021	30-Jun-2025	PA-20-185	CCDI
project	1U01CA263967-01	U01CA263967	10300341	2021	Pediatric Preclinical In Vivo Testing Center for Pediatric Sarcoma and Other Solid Tumors	Grant	ABSTRACT\nWith recent enactment of the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act, there is a\ngrowing impetus to identify pediatric indications for molecularly targeted drugs. Accordingly, there is a pressing\nneed for clinically relevant preclinical studies that can help prioritize pediatric indications for clinical application\nof nearly the entire universe of cancer drugs currently in development. To meet this need, we established a\npreclinical testing program that has created >300 genomically-characterized pediatric solid tumor patient-\nderived xenograft (PDX) models between the pediatric oncology programs at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer\nCenter and University of California San Francisco. We propose to leverage this large portfolio of models across\na diversity of diseases, along with the deep expertise of the team, to establish a NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing\nProgram (Ped-In Vivo-TP) Research Team focused on pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas, renal tumors,\ndesmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) and other rare pediatric solid tumors. The Aims of this Research\nTeam are: Aim 1. Integrate with the Coordinating Center and other Research Teams to prioritize agents\nfor preclinical evaluation. We will leverage our team's translational expertise as well as existing connections\nto disease committees within cooperative groups to inform and facilitate new agent selection and preclinical\nevaluation in appropriate models to prioritize agents to advance into pediatric oncology clinical trials. Aim 2.\nUtilize PDX portfolios representative of disease heterogeneity to assess therapeutic agents. We will\nutilize the >300 PDX models from MSKCC and UCSF, supplemented with models from the PROXC consortium\nwhere necessary, to assess 8-10 therapeutic agents/year using study designs matched to the therapeutic\nquestion. All preclinical drug testing will be conducted at MSKCC. Aim 3. Align central and local data\nanalyses to ensure rigor in results reporting. For the purposes of prioritization, we will maintain equipoise in\nvalidating (“go”) or invalidating (“no go”) therapeutic hypotheses, and will complement central data analyses\nwith advanced local biostatistical expertise. Aim 4. Translational biomarker discovery. We will leverage the\ncombined expertise of our Research Team to identify clinically translatable biomarkers predictive of enhanced\nresponse or drug resistance. In some cases, predictive biomarkers may not be genetic, but instead will depend\non transcriptional or protein-based assays of target activity. In other cases, genomically identified biomarkers\nhave to be translated to clinically utilizable assays. Together, the expertise and capabilities of this Research\nTeam will support the rigorous evaluation of novel therapeutic hypotheses in clinically-representative models to\nenable prioritization and translation of the most promising emerging agents into biomarker-informed clinical\ntrials for children with high risk solid tumors.

To coordinate the activities of the new Ped-In Vivo-TP initiative, we have assembled a team of\ninvestigators from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and Seven Bridges Genomics (SB) with unique combined\nexpertise and experience with in vivo cancer models, scalable cloud-based data management and analysis\nsystems, informatics resource development, and multi-site project coordination. Combining the complementary\nstrengths of JAX and SB provides the ideal foundation for a coordinating center to maximize the short- and\nlong-term impacts of the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program for advancing the application of precision medicine\nin pediatric oncology. We will manage a comprehensive and cohesive testing program to advance precision\nmedicine in pediatric oncology through effective public-private partnerships among pharmaceutical companies,\nregulatory agencies, funders, and research organizations. We will achieve this goal through the following aims:\nAim 1: Establish and maintain the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Coordinating Center (PIVOT CC) to provide\nadministrative and logistical support for diverse stakeholders in the Pediatric in Vivo Testing Program\nconsortium. We will draw on our team's combined decades of experience with multi-site program\nmanagement, cancer model development, standardized testing of in vivo cancer models, data management\nand analysis, and informatics resource development to ensure timely decision making, conformance to\nstandard protocols, resource tracking, and effective communications within the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Aim 2:\nProvide data management, statistical, and bioinformatics support to ensure data security and integrity.\nWe will leverage existing protocols and software systems at JAX and SB to identify relevant in vivo cancer\nmodels and to collect, analyze, and securely manage data generated from testing centers within the\nconsortium. We will perform statistical and bioinformatic analyses on consortium data to reliably inform the\nevaluation of the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in a pediatric oncology setting. We will develop a public-\nfacing data portal for sharing of data and methods with the broader scientific community. Aim 3: Provide\nscientific coordination to maintain an efficient and effective preclinical testing pipeline. We will draw\nfrom the extensive experience of our team with in vivo pharmacology and coordination of similar consortia to\nmanage and coordinate the testing of agents by the Ped-In Vivo-TP centers at all stages of the process, from\nthe identification of relevant in vivo models to the generation of final technical reports and publication of results.\nWe will develop, record, and track performance metrics for the consortium to inform the evaluation of the\nprogram's success and impact.

However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue\ndamage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than\n40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of\nlife complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers\nremains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with\nhigh-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease.\nThe Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and\nadolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members,\nconducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal\nis for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its\ncollaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites.

However, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue\ndamage, hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than\n40% of the estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health-related quality of\nlife complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. In addition, progress for a number of childhood cancers\nremains limited with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50% of children with\nhigh-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing to their disease.\nThe Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and\nadolescent cancer research, and its multidisciplinary research teams comprised of more than 9,000 members,\nconducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and cancer centers. This proposal\nis for the COG NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base to continue its\ncollaborative research work for our 26 community and 16 minority/underserved NCORP sites. With COG’s\nsignificant scientific, statistical, data management and information technology infrastructure, we seek to conduct\npediatric clinical trials to define optimal treatments, and conduct laboratory research that will translate into more\neffective treatments with reduced side effects.

project	3UG1CA189828-07S1	UG1CA189828	10230790	2020	ECOG-ACRIN NCORP Research Base	Grant	Project Summary\nThe ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (EA) is dedicated to decreasing the burden of cancer. EA\nis a vibrant member of the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and the NCI Community Oncology\nResearch Program (NCORP), focused on practice-changing clinical and translational research across\nthe cancer care continuum from prevention and early detection, through the management of advanced\ndisease and its impact. As an NCORP Research Base, EA has engaged community providers and\nresearchers to develop a robust research portfolio that spans Cancer Prevention, Cancer Control, and\nCancer Care Delivery, aligned with the overall scientific themes of precision oncology, immuno-oncology,\nreducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and leveraging novel biomarker platforms. Cancer control\ntrials examine and intervene on challenges associated with cancer and treatment-related symptoms and\nconcerns. EA's portfolio of therapeutic trials yield opportunities to apply patient-reported outcomes\nmeasurement science to quantify health-related quality of life, symptoms, and domains most relevant to\npatients in the context of evolving treatment paradigms. Behavioral and biomarker-driven symptom\ninterventions aim to improve quality of life and cancer survivorship. Cardiotoxicity research aims to\nmitigate risk through quantifying cardiotoxicity associated with treatment, identifying groups at risk, and\nadvancing interventions to reduce risk. Prevention trials embrace the NCI's broad definition of prevention\nto include primary prevention, cancer screening, and secondary prevention and aim to identify high risk\ngroups for precision prevention strategies. Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) examines the\ncomplex interactions between patient, provider, and system factors that influence care, and adapts and\nevaluates interventions in heterogenous community oncology practices. Health equity research\npermeates EA science through embedding disparities-related research questions that span EA activities,\nadopting a broad view of underserved populations including adolescents and young adults, the elderly,\nracial and ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities and rural residents. Key collaborations with\ncommunity-based oncology programs will ensure access to EA NCTN and NCORP trials in communities\nwhere patients receive their care. EA provides access to existing NCI-funded resources and a network\nof >10000 physicians, scientists, nurses, research associates (RAs), statisticians, biomedical information\ntechnologists, and patient advocates across approximately 600 institutions and organizations. EA has\nprovided scientific leadership in the NCORP community through advancing rigorous, practice-changing\nclinical trials and translational research in cancer control, prevention and care delivery and is well poised\nto continue to support the NCI's mission to engage community-based diverse populations in cancer\nresearch.

However, some clinical trials are excluded\nfrom mandatory reporting to the NCI Data Archive, including phase 1 or 2 studies and older\nphase 3 studies with primary publication dates prior to 2015. Some of these datasets may be\nuseful for secondary analyses by other investigators if patient-level data were made available\npublicly. For example, a well annotated clinical trial dataset from phase 1 or 2 studies could be\nused as an external control for the purpose of FDA approval of an agent evaluated in a single arm\nstudy without a concurrent control arm. Another example is the pooling of outcome data for an\nuncommon tumor histology from multiple phase 2 studies to guide the design of a future study.\nTo increase the number of study datasets that are available for public use, COG is requesting an\nadministrative supplement to fund the generation of selected legacy clinical trial datasets.

PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative\ngenomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the\ndisposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer.\nAnnually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto\nclinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core premier pediatric oncology sites throughout\nthe country. The network institutions are selected through a peer review process, and serve as\na national and international model for new agent development in pediatric oncology. The PEP-\nCTN will leverage the database infrastructure and resources of the parent Children's Oncology\nGroup while maintaining its own administrative and operational infrastructure to ensure rapid\ndevelopment, implementation, and reporting of specialized and complex early phase clinical trials.\nThe PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of translational biology,\npharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art informatics systems\nto facilitate the transfer of response and correlative imaging studies for central review and\nanalyses.\nThe PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer\nagents into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To\nexpeditiously obtain preliminary efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and\npilot studies in order to inform tumor specific trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To\nperform genomic analyses, including single gene studies or gene panels, to identify appropriate\npatients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor\ncharacteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole exome\nsequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints,\nincluding circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities,\ninto early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect\non tumors.. Development of targeted therapy for childhood cancer is a high priority as it offers the\nprospect of more efficacious and less toxic therapeutics.

This is true both in\ninternational comparisons of rates of ALL in African nations to those elsewhere, and in comparing rate of B-ALL\nin African-American (AA) children to that in European-American (EA) children in the United States. The inverse\nassociation of African ancestry with incidence of B-ALL is independent of established perinatal risk factors for\nthe disease. Moreover, AA children have lower incidence despite having greater exposure to many putatively\ncausal environmental risk factors for B-ALL than do EA children. Common genetic variants established by\ngenomewide association studies incompletely explain the deficit of B-ALL in AA children, suggesting\nundiscovered contributing genetic factors may be detected by admixture mapping. We have assembled existing\nDNA samples and data for 930 B-ALL patients with AA ancestry and will additionally accrue ~590 over the life\nof the project. We will conduct admixture mapping in the assembled group of patients to detect new genetic loci\nand new variants at established loci associated with occurrence of B-ALL. In addition, we will examine admixture\nin association with clinical characteristics at diagnosis and survival. Candidate genes/variants will be functionally\nevaluated through both in silico and in vitro techniques. The proposed research will potentially answer a long-\nstanding mystery by revealing critical genes or loci that explain the comparative deficit of B-ALL in AA compared\nto EA children. In addition, we may uncover genes or variants associated with the worse characteristics at\npresentation in AA patients as well as with worse survival, which will indicate avenues for improving outcome\namong AA children.

project	3U24CA209999-05S1	U24CA209999	10227337	2020	Adapting Functional Precision Oncology for pediatric brain cancer	Grant	ABSTRACT\nCancers are typically composed of heterogeneous populations of tumors cells characterized by mutations that\ndistinguish each cell subpopulation from one another. The parent grant leverages DNA sequencing and a suite\nof important new analytical algorithms and visualization tools to identify mutations in cancer patients and track\nthe evolution of a patient’s tumor over the course of treatment. The tools we have developed, or are in the\nprocess of developing, form the foundation of a functional precision oncology approach we are implementing at\nthe University of Utah with a combination of set-aside funding from the parent project, and institutional funding.\nThe current Supplemental Request will adapt the tools funded by the parent project for effective use in pediatric\ncancers. The main objective of this Supplemental Proposal is to adapt our functional precision oncology\napproach to inform treatment selection in children with brain tumors, a patient cohort that experiences extremely\ndire prognoses in which rational treatment choice is difficult without precision guidance. There are compelling\nreasons to believe, however, that such adaptation will require algorithmic modifications. This is because key\naspects of our approach rely on genomic mutations in the tumor, but previous studies show that pediatric tumors\nhave a substantially lower mutation load than adult cancers. Therefore it is necessary to expand our functional\napproach in pediatric cases, and adapt them to lower mutation loads in pediatric tumors. To accomplish such\nadaptation, we will, first, perform functional drug screening and genomic/transcriptomic characterization in two\npediatric brain cancer index patients, so we have appropriate test cases drivin our tool development and testing.\nWe will then, second, analyze the pediatric brain tumor index patient datasets, and adapt our functional precision\ninformatics methods for use in pediatric brain tumors with expected lower genomic mutation loads. We foresee\ntwo specific areas of development: because of the substantially lower number of mutations in the pediatric cases,\nwe will integrate the ability to simultaneously analyze somatic copy number variation (CNV) mutations, together\nwith somatic point mutations to (1) reconstruct the genomic subclones that make up the tumor; and (2) to carry\nout cell assignment to the genomically defined sublones from single-cell RNA sequencing data used to study\ntumor subclone-specific gene expression behavior. We have already shown that CNVs can be used both for\ntumor subclone reconstruction and cell assignment, and anticipate that by integrating CNV and point mutation-\nbased analyses in a single tool will allow functional precision analysis of pediatric cancer patients at, or close to,\nthe level achievable for adult patients.\n1	Adult;Algorithmic Software;Algorithms;Area;Behavior;Brain Neoplasms;Cancer Patient;Cells;Child;Childhood;Childhood Brain Neoplasm;Childhood Malignant Brain Tumor;Copy Number Polymorphism;DNA sequencing;Data;Data Set;Development;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Drug Screening;Evolution;Foundations;Funding;Gene Expression;Genomics;Informatics;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Modification;Mutation;Patients;Pediatric Neoplasm;Point Mutation;Population Heterogeneity;Process;Selection for Treatments;Testing;Universities;Utah;Visualization software;base;cohort;computerized tools;experience;indexing;neoplastic cell;parent grant;parent project;precision oncology;reconstruction;single-cell RNA sequencing;tool;tool development;transcriptomics;treatment choice;tumor;tumor heterogeneity	UNIVERSITY OF UTAH	SALT LAKE CITY	UT	UNITED STATES	Gabor T Marth,Aaron R Quinlan	DCB	Jerry  Li	152418	<$250k	152418	14-Sep-2020	1-Sep-2016	31-Aug-2022	PA-18-591	CCDI

The primary objective of this two-year program is to train physician-scientists capable\nof providing a critical bridge between the biological sciences and experimental therapeutics. In order to\nachieve this objective, the training program emphasizes a didactic curriculum in clinical research\nmethodology, mentor-supervised clinical and basic science research experiences, and ongoing Scholar\nmonitoring and feedback. All Scholars are assigned a clinical trial project during the course of the training\nprogram. All 40 clinical and laboratory mentors participating in this training program have extensive\nexperience in neuro-oncology research and training, active research funding, and provide an excellent\nresource for Scholars interested in translational research. All Scholars have access to dedicated biostatistical\nand computing support on all projects. An Internal Advisory Committee, as well as an External Advisory\nCommittee, oversee the training program. There is no significant overlap between our unique grant focused\non nervous system tumors and other training grants at Harvard focused on medical oncology. Candidates\ninclude physicians completing clinical training in adult and pediatric neuro-oncology, adult and pediatric\nneurosurgical oncology, adult and pediatric medical oncology and radiation oncology. A qualified pool of\napplicants from these disciplines can be expected to grow from existing and developing sources. Each\nScholar has a dedicated two-year block for research and training with minimal clinical responsibilities. Four\npostdoctoral positions are requested per year for five years with each Scholar making a two-year commitment\nto investigation. Applicants will be solicited through advertisements, and by active recruitment by the program\nand individual faculty. The training program remains committed to recruitment of a diverse Scholar pool. We\nbelieve that the proposed training program capitalizes on a group of outstanding mentors and superb training\nfacilities and will have the capability to produce productive patient-oriented researchers in neuro-oncology.\nSince the original award 20 years ago, the quality of the program has steadily improved based upon such\nmetrics as diversity in Scholar clinical specialties, Scholar publications, Scholar academic positions, Scholar\nleadership of national clinical trials, and Scholar grant awards.

project	2U01CA199288-06	U01CA199288	10300370	2021	In vivo Drug Testing of Pediatric CNS Tumors Using Patient Derived Orthotopic Xenograft Models	Grant	This application is prepared in response to the funding opportunity: NCI Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program\n(U01), RFA-CA-20-034 to renew our existing PPTC UO1 grant. Specifically, we propose to continue the in vivo\ntesting program for central nervous system (CNS) tumors using our panel of patient derived orthotopic xenograft\n(PDOX) models. Brain tumor is the leading cause of cancer-related death in children. One of the challenges\nin clinical drug development is how to effectively prioritize drug candidates to ensure clinical success in\ncancer patients. However, efforts in identifying new anti-cancer agents for that are most likely to be effective\nin the clinic have been blocked for many years due to the lack of clinically relevant and molecularly\naccurate model system. Fortunately, we have established a panel of 150 PDOX models of pediatric brain\ntumors through direct injection of patient tumor specimens into the brains of SCID mice. These PDOX models\nare shown to have replicated the histopathology and major genetic abnormalities of the original patient\ntumors even during serial sub-transplantations in vivo in mouse brains. They not only represent different\nclinical stage (i.e., at diagnosis, relapse and terminal/autopsy) but also replicate a broad spectrum of the newly\nidentified molecular subtypes of nearly all types of pediatric brain tumors. The xenograft tumor cells can also\nbe cryopreserved for sustained and on-demand supply of tumorigenic PDOX cells. This capacity combined\nwith our optimized surgical procedure, with which we can implant up to 260 mice per day, makes it possible for\nus to test multiple (e.g., 6-10) drugs per year for every tumor type. Our objective is therefore to make use of\nthis unique panel of PDOX models to examine therapeutic efficacy of new agents and to analyze mechanisms\nof action and therapy resistance in high grade glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, DIPG and ATRT. Our\nhypothesis is that these patient-specific PDOX tumors will respond to anti-cancer therapies similarly to the\ncorresponding human primary tumors, and the effective agents identified through this system would have\nbetter chances of clinical success. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo\nassays to achieve the following aims: 1) to identify genetically accurate candidate PDOX models that bear\nthe therapeutic target(s) of new investigational drugs through data mining of our mouse model molecular\ncharacterization databases; 2) to select the most responsive models through functional in vitro screening to\ndetermine time- and dose-responses; 3) to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of new investigational drugs\nin multiple target-bearing PDOX models; and 4) to perform detailed analysis of cellular and molecular\nmechanisms of cell killing as well as the causes of therapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Our novel\npanel of PDOX mouse models represents a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities of pediatric CNS\ntumors.

This exercise is uniquely challenging for pediatric cancers.\nEven compared to other cancers, childhood cancers are highly heterogeneous, often involving genes not\ntypically attributed to adult cancers and often involving complex, large-scale variations. Childhood cancers also\ntend to arise in less differentiated cell lineages, progress rapidly, and have much lower incidence and mutation\nburden. These characteristics are compounded by unique clinical challenges related to developmental factors\nand treatment-related secondary cancers, resulting in significantly fewer targeted therapy options available to\npediatric patients. These challenges have led to a significant under-representation of genes and variants\nrelevant to childhood cancers in public cancer databases and knowledgebases. Thus, there is a critical unmet\nneed for structured genetic variant level data in publicly accessible databases which document diagnostic,\nprognostic and therapeutic biomarkers for childhood cancers. The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI)\nfocuses on accelerating research on childhood cancers by developing and enhancing tools and methods to\nextract knowledge and enable sharing of childhood cancer data. The CIViC resource is a knowledge extraction\nand data sharing platform for clinical interpretation of cancer variants. Expert curators extract knowledge and\nevidence from the literature to produce rigorous and high-quality assertions following widely-recognized clinical\nvariant classification guidelines. The variant classifications are made freely available in the public domain and\nare widely utilized in clinical workflows. However, to date, CIViC knowledge curation has focused almost\nentirely on adult malignancies. Other key variant knowledgebases either do not provide clinical relevance, lack\nchildhood-specific interpretations, and/or have restrictive licenses. We propose to close this knowledge gap in\nCIViC by forging new and expanded collaboration with pediatric cancer experts, and building domain-specific\ntools for curation and dissemination of high-quality variant interpretations for childhood cancers. The CIViC\nvisual interface will be adapted to better support curation and dissemination of childhood cancer variants\ninterpretations. A modification of our existing natural language processing approach will be used to prioritize\nliterature relevant to childhood cancers and an expert panel will prioritize childhood variants and subsequently\nperform and also evaluate curation on taskforce calls. Based on the experience and products of this work, we\nwill develop childhood-cancer-specific curation guidelines and conduct pilot development of a childhood cancer\nvariant panel that is capable of evolving rapidly as childhood cancer variant knowledge accumulates in CIViC.

Over 90% of United States and Canadian children and adolescents with cancer are\ntreated at COG institutions with no racial, ethnic or geographic bias to registration, allowing for near-\npopulation-based clinical, translational and basic research. COG has established a strong track record of\ncollecting and banking tumor and non-diseased biospecimens from patients enrolled in COG-sponsored\nclinical trials, most of which include randomized treatment questions. The COG Biospecimen Bank (COG\nBiobank), located within the Biopathology Center (part of the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at\nNationwide Children’s Hospital), aims to provide high-quality pediatric and adolescent human malignant\nbiospecimens to the research community. Upon review and approval, biospecimens are prioritized for\ndistribution to the COG investigators defined in the clinical trial protocols. After the needs of the planned\nresearch have been addressed, residual (legacy) banked biospecimens can be distributed to other\ninvestigators within and outside COG via the NCTN Navigator The COG Group and Biobank Concierges\ncan also facilitate access to COG legacy biospecimens that are not currently uploaded in Navigator. For\nall biospecimen distribution projects, a feasibility assessment by the COG Biobank and the COG\nStatistical and Data Management Center (SDMC) is completed prior to proposal submission. This\nproposal supports the collection, processing, and distribution of biospecimens from patient enrolled on\nCOG-sponsored trials. The Pediatric Division of the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) then\nfacilitates the distribution of the approved legacy biospecimens.\nThe COG Biobank seeks to directly promote and support outstanding research in the diagnosis and\ntreatment of pediatric cancer through centralized collection, quality control, storage, and distribution\nprocedures. The COG Biobank will continue efforts to provide the latest biorepository-based\ntechnological innovations and best practices, resulting in constant improvements in our operational\ncapabilities, investigator access to biospecimens, investigator satisfaction, and the stewardship of these\nprecious resources. Under proper regulatory guidelines and in association with the COG SDMC, the\nCOG Biobank will support translational aspects of cutting-edge research by ensuring appropriate tracking\nof biospecimens as well as linkage to existing demographic, clinical, biological, treatment, and outcome\ndata. Finally, the COG Biobank will provide investigators with a comprehensive database solution and\ndynamic informatics tools that facilitate pediatric cancer research. The COG Biobank also plans to\nsupport the processing, banking, and distribution of biospecimens to the Cancer Immune Monitoring and\nAnalysis Centers (CIMACs).

The long-term goal of the Mossé\nand Maris translational research programs is to substantively improve neuroblastoma cure rates by developing\npatient-specific therapies that target the unique oncogenic drivers of each case. Within the context of the\nNational Cancer Institute’s Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) we propose a Neuroblastoma\nResearch Program built on richly annotated and highly characterized patient derived xenograft (PDX) and\nother recently developed murine models of this disease. The central hypothesis to be tested in this Program is\nthat neuroblastoma-specific oncogenic drivers and optimal immunotherapeutic targets can be defined and\nexploited through rationally designed therapies based on validated and clinically measurable biomarkers.\nThrough our dedicated focus on neuroblastoma and our central role in the former Pediatric Preclinical Testing\nProgram and Consortium, we have developed an investigative team and rich set of resources and reagents to\nbe uniquely positioned to achieve the goals of the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Here we propose to use a large (and\ngrowing) collection of PDX models that have been fully characterized with the most modern genomic\ntechnologies to address the challenge of prioritizing the large armamentarium of anti-cancer agents in\ndevelopment so that early phase biomarker-driven clinical trials can be designed with the objective of showing\npotent and specific anti-tumor activity. We propose three specific aims directed towards 1) developing and\ncharacterizing highly annotated models of human neuroblastoma; 2) performing preclinical trials with drugs\ndirected against defined therapeutic vulnerabilities in order to prioritize agents for the clinic, and 3) developing\nthe portfolio of preclinical data required for design of clinical trials with robust biomarkers for patient selection\nand monitoring. In collaboration with other preclinical testing programs, we will seek to determine if discoveries\nin our program are relevant to other childhood cancers and collaborate across disease groups on clinical\ndevelopment strategies. Thus, this Program will seek to shift the paradigm for how high-risk neuroblastoma\npatients are treated with the goal of substantively improving the outcomes, both in terms of cure rates, but also\nby decreasing the toxicity associated with current standards of care.

Thus, the primary\ngoal in the treatment of T-ALL is to prevent relapse, which requires accurate risk stratification. Unfortunately, no\ngenetic alterations have been identified to date that are reproducibly prognostic independent of minimal residual\ndisease (MRD), making it difficult at diagnosis to identify which patients are more likely to relapse. AALL0434\nwas a Children's Oncology Group-initiated phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing Capizzi-style escalating\nmethotrexate plus pegaspargase (CMTX) vs. high dose methotrexate (HDMTX), with/without six 5-day courses\nof nelarabine. Survival on this study was superior to any prior trial for de novo T-ALL, changing the standard of\ncare. Yet, a substantial minority (~15%) of patients had relapsed or refractory (r/r) disease. Our group recently\nreceived an X01/Gabriella Miller Kids First award to perform comprehensive genomic profiling on 1262 cases of\nT-ALL treated on the AALL0434 clinical trial (1X01HD100702-01). This includes whole genome sequencing\n(WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES), and transcriptome profiling (RNAseq) of tumor and WGS of germline.\nWe have separately performed copy number analysis (SNP) on germline samples that will be integrated with\nthis work. We hypothesize that comprehensive genomic profiling of the entire AALL0434 cohort will identify\nrecurrent genetic alterations that can be segregated into biologically relevant deregulated pathways that can be\ncombined with MRD to identify patients at risk for poor outcomes before they relapse and provide rationale for\ntreatment with alternative therapies. In addition, a number of small recent studies demonstrated that many of the\nbiologically relevant alterations in T-ALL occur in non-coding regions of the genome, but no large studies have\nperformed whole genome sequencing in T-ALL. We further hypothesize that whole genome sequencing of a\nlarge cohort of patients with T-ALL will identify novel lesions in coding and non-coding regions that will be highly\nimpactful in the understanding of T-ALL pathogenesis. We will test our hypotheses with the following specific\naims: (1) identify recurrent genetic alterations that predict poor outcome in T-ALL; (2) identify novel alterations,\nincluding non-coding alterations in T-ALL; and (3) identify germline genetic variants that predispose to T-ALL.\nThe goal of the Kids First Program is improve understanding of genetic mechanisms of disease, leading to\nimproved diagnostic capabilities and ultimately more targeted therapies or interventions. This proposal will meet\nthat important goal through identification of germline and somatic alterations in T-ALL that can be used to identify\npatients that are likely to relapse before they relapse and can be treated with new therapies.

PEP-CTN clinical trials will incorporate correlative\ngenomics, biology, pharmacology, and imaging studies to further the understanding of the\ndisposition and action of new agents introduced into the treatment of children with cancer.\nAnnually, the PEP-CTN will enroll approximately 120 children and adolescents with cancer onto\nclinical trials of novel anticancer agents at the 21 core-member sites and 21 non-core member\nsites throughout the US, Canada, and Australia. The network institutions are selected through a\npeer review process, and serve as a national and international model for new agent development\nin pediatric oncology. The PEP-CTN leverages the database infrastructure and resources of the\nparent Children’s Oncology Group while maintaining its own administrative and operational\ninfrastructure to ensure rapid development, implementation, and reporting of specialized and\ncomplex early phase clinical trials. The PEP-CTN has expertise and resources for the conduct of\ntranslational biology, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacogenetic studies, and utilizes state-of-the-art\ninformatics systems to facilitate the transfer of response and correlative imaging studies for\ncentral review and analyses.\nThe PEP-CTN's primary specific aims are: 1) To safely and efficiently introduce novel anticancer\nagents into the pediatric setting through the conduct of early phase clinical trials; 2) To\nexpeditiously obtain preliminary efficacy signals through use of phase 2 expansion cohorts and\npilot studies in order to inform tumor specific trials that will be conducted across COG sites; 3) To\nperform genomic analyses, including single gene studies or gene panels, to identify appropriate\npatients for early phase studies of targeted agents; 4) To identify associations of tumor\ncharacteristics with response to new agents using genomic analyses such as whole exome\nsequencing and RNA sequencing; 5) To incorporate pharmacologic and biologic endpoints,\nincluding circulating tumor DNA, other translational laboratory studies, and imaging modalities,\ninto early phase studies, in order to enhance our understanding of the new agents and their effect\non tumors.. Development of targeted therapy for childhood cancer is a high priority as it offers the\nprospect of more efficacious and less toxic therapeutics.
