Instructions on how to set up the ICDC data loader on a Windows Computer

1.	Install python
a.	https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
b.	Install Windows x86-64 executable installer for windows machines
2.	In the command line type “python”	
a.	You will see the “<<<<<” prompt if it installed correctly
3.	Type “quit()” to exit python
4.	Go to https://neo4j.com/download/ to download Neo4j Desktop
5.	Download a copy of the data loader from https://github.com/CBIIT/icdc-dataloader 
6.	Unzip files into a folder/location
7.	In the command line type “cd “<path where python is loaded>” it might be “C:\Users\<your_user_name>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37”
8.	In the command line type "Scripts\pip.exe install neo4j"
9.	In the command line type "Scripts\pip.exe install pyyaml"
10.	In the command line type “Scripts\pip.exe install boto3”
11.	Open Neo4j desktop
12.	Create local graph (only needs to be once)
13.	Set a password to it and make sure you remember it

Locations on Shared Drive
Z:\CBIIT\NCICB\Claire and Kevin data loader\icdc-dataloader-master contains the dataloader
Z:\CBIIT\NCICB\Claire and Kevin ICDC contains the data files to be loaded







Running the loader on remote Windows server

1-	Login to ncias-d2235-c.nci.nih.gov with your NIH credentials 
2-	Open Neo4J Desktop
3-	Create a local graph on Neo4J and make sure you remember the password, or use one you already have
a.	Creating a graph only needs to be once but you can create multiple graphs if needed
b.	Most likely only one graph is needed, and you will re-use this graph for ICDC loading
c.	For example, my graph for ICDC is called “ICDC”
4-	Start the graph
5-	Open Command Prompt
6-	It will default to the H:\, change it to Z:\ by entering “Z:” then press enter
7-	Type cd Z:\CBIIT\NCICB\Claire and Kevin data loader\icdc-dataloader-master click enter
a.	This is the location of the data loader on the shared drive
8-	Type python loader.py -p password -s test/data/icdc-model.yml -s test/data/icdc-model-props.yml "Z:\CBIIT\NCICB\Claire and Kevin ICDC" and hit enter
a.	“password” is the password to my local graph on the Neo4j desktop, you should use your password specified in step 3
b.	"Z:\CBIIT\NCICB\Claire and Kevin ICDC" is where the loading files I want to load live


Running the loader on your personal desktop (having everything you need installed)

1-	Open Neo4J Desktop
2-	Create a local graph on Neo4J and make sure you remember the password, or use one you already have
a.	Creating a graph only needs to be once but you can create multiple graphs if needed
b.	Most likely only one graph is needed, and you will re-use this graph for ICDC loading
c.	For example, my graph for ICDC is called “ICDC”
3-	Start the graph
4-	Open Command Prompt
5-	It will default to the H:\, change it to C:\ by entering “C:” then press enter (or open the drive name your loader is in)
6-	Type cd (location of your data loader) and hit enter
a.	This is the location of the data loader on the shared drive
b.	In my case it’s cd C:\Users\burnskd\Desktop\data loader\icdc-dataloader-master
7-	Type C:\Users\burnskd\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python loader.py -p password -s test\data\icdc-model.yml -s test\data\icdc-model-props.yml “Z:\CBIIT\NCICB\Claire and Kevin ICDC" and hit enter
a.	“C:\Users\burnskd\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\” is the location of python on your local machine
b.	“password” is the password to my local Neo4j graph, you should use the password specified in step 2
c.	“Z:\CBIIT\NCICB\Claire and Kevin ICDC” is where the loading files live


Wiping the data you just loaded, or the database in general (local database)

1-	Open Neo4j Desktop
2-	Start the graph you loaded the data onto
3-	Click “Manage” on that graph
4-	Click “Open Browser”
5-	Enter query MATCH (n) detach delete n then press enter


Count number of cases (or other type of nodes)

1-	Do 1-4 from above
2-	Enter query MATCH (n:case) return count (n) then press enter

Accessing the DEV database through Neo4j desktop

1-	Open Neo4j desktop
2-	Connect to a remote graph
3-	URL = http://ncias-d2224-c.nci.nih.gov:7474/browser/
4-	See Ming for account info to connect
